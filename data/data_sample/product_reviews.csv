The case was just a cheap little plastic thing that I've had for years and the charging capability did not penetrate.

They DID charge, just not as advertised hence the 3 out 5 rating.

I thought I'd use this at my beside table to charge overnight, but wound up placing one on my desk and one in a handy area in our kitchen. I don't lose my phone as the charger stays in one place. (A place for everything and everything in its place!)
At my desk, I don't have to fiddle with a fragile cord while I ignore repeated phone calls!
I'll probably get a few more, as they are very handy and don't get tangled like the dozen or so cords fighting for real estate on my desk.
Cordless chargers do create some heat on the charger and the phone as well. A bit of research and I learned that the heat is normal and not detrimental to the device or the phone. I just wasn't prepared for that, and it did alarm me until I learned it's okay.
Yes - I'd recommend this device! Easy use, quick charge!"

However, charger would be better if the LED wasn't ALWAYS on. LED is on if a) no phone on charger, b) problem charging the phone, or c) phone is on charger but fully charged. Why not just have the LED off if no phone being charged? At night I don't like seeing the LED when I'm in bed."

Charger will charge the phone but it has to be set just perfectly on it, which can be a little annoying at night, but there is a red/green light so you know when it is actually charging. Also I can not get rapid charging to work with this charger and my Pixel 6 so it may not actually be a 15W charger."

I gave the other one to a friend and hers still works, so I guess I hit the bad end of the 50/50 lottery.

I'd ask for a replacement, but I obviously can't send them back at this point."

Not much to say about it. Does what it needs to do. 0 complaints. Not the fastest charger out there but it does say it's 15watts so can't complain. And I got 2 of them for under 20 bucks on sale.

Definitely a good value!

The charging pad has one LED light. It is red in idle and turns green during wireless charging.

The charging pad charges my Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel buds smoothly. I connect them to normal power adapter instead of QC3.0 adapter. The charging current is ~650m. Not super fast but good enough for me. The charging pad should reach full speed when connected to QC3.0 power adapter.

So far, I am happy with this purchase."

Gilman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, extremely pleased","I love that this is a two pack. I put one on my bedside table to charge at night and one in my laptop bag to travel with me while I am at work or on the go.
There is a light on the side that is red when nothing is charging or your phone is misaligned. That light turns green when your phone is set up to charge. I have had other wireless charging pads and none have had that feature.
The only drawback is that to get the full rapid charging experience you need the correct charging plugs for the wall. I wish there was a ""frequently bought together"" option so I could buy the correct wall plug to make these really fast."
