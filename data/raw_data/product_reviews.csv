It has revolutionized my nightstand setup by occupying minimal space and doubling as a convenient phone stand that resembles an alarm clock. This design choice makes it effortless to keep an eye on my phone's screen. The thoughtful angle at which it holds my phone is a game changer, allowing me to charge and stream content simultaneously - a feature that truly enhances my experience."

I'm happy that they work!! My iPhone Jack has failed, so these are the only means I have of charging my phone now. They're quite slow, but better than nothing.
I wish the cord was longer."

So at night, when your phone reaches 100% around midnight, it will slowly discharge and be a 90% when you wake up."

It isn't too fussy about placement but if it is moved slightly it can stop charging which can be a problem if you touch your phone during an overnight charging.
I did purchase two more. I haven't had the problems others have reported such dying after limited usage, getting too hot or giving an incomplete charge. I'd rate it as good value for the money."

Problem is it never turns charging back on unless devices is removed and placed back on
This is a problem when charging at bedtime only to wake up with device not fully charged cause it lost battery life while charging unit automatic turned off at 100%. My phone percentage went from 100 to 85 percent in less than two hours with it on charging while listening to music . Not happy with them at all."

It charges fast. The trick is to place it on the charger correctly. I think the ones complaining about it not working are not placing it on the charger properly. I love the black color and the light is unobtrusive but I can still tell when it is charging. These are wonderful!

They did not have the Fast charging capability or charge my Samsung Galaxy Earbuds to full capacity. It took hours to charge my phone and did not work through the case I had on my phone.

The case was just a cheap little plastic thing that I've had for years and the charging capability did not penetrate.

They DID charge, just not as advertised hence the 3 out 5 rating.

These items were returned.

Return process was easy as pie though!"
