8313,1,i received the camera yesterday my granddaughters birthday is today the camera did not come with the stated memory card so now i cant give it to her until i get one i am very disappointedno memory card
9622,5,"i gave this  stars because it cooks rice perfectly in about  minutesone thing to note  it says it will cook  cups of dry rice but it is too small for that much rice it came with a small measuring bowl that is marked  cup but a cup is a bit more than  actual cups of uncooked rice is the limit but it cooks it really well so i gave it  starscooks rice perfectly"
14529,5,works perfectly no mess perfectly cooked rice every timeworks great
8752,2,christmas present that completely turned into a disaster the camera didnt work once it was unable to spit out the film the cartridge seem to be bulging and pressing on the door the film is  months old even though its brand new partially spit one out but covered the rollers in some sort of blue chemical that is all through out the inside of the camera cheap plastic junk buy an old one on ebay from when things used to be made to workcheaply made sent with expired film
6829,1,new batteries did not work no matter which polarity was usedon line instructions are just too muchmickey mouse for all the exceptionstoo many instructions that address how to fix problems
15647,5,"this rice cooker works great really easy to use and clean just plug it in and cook the included rice paddle is really cheaply made but the rest of it is really good bonus its a great colormy review criteria i do not review anything that i dont wantneed for my own personal use and i have enough knowledge about it to provide accurate and useful details i do tell it like it is and i am not influenced to provide feedback that isnt based on facts or my own experience therefore you can trust my unbiased review as if i were a friend looking out for your best interest and that of your hardearned moneyworks great"
12185,5,its the best simple to use perfect everytime dont shop around this is the onethe only rice cooker for me
10722,4,i assumed the  cup rice cooker would be a bit bigger very small it also doesnt actually make  cups according to the pamphlet it came with which is weird however i love that it came with cooking directions and a whole variety of food you can cook with this came with a steamer basket and spoon as wellsmall
17442,5,this is a superb machine for making perfect rice its not a multi cooker it cooks rice and it cooks it perfectly i have had a zojirushi rice cooker for  years before this one it went through  inner pots and eventually its battery died but it still made great rice this is a better rice cooker in every way and it makes even more perfect rice i was considering a cuckoo but really dont need an appliance that talks to me especially one that i use every day the consistency of the zojirushi interface i instantly knew how everything works same as my old one and the handle to carry it sealed the deal i am absolutely delighted its a heavy well built quality piece of kit im confident it will probably last as well as my previous one which was at  years was exceptional value for money and did i mention it makes the best rice ever the jasmine rice setting is worth the upgrade the gaba setting really delicious easily digested brown rice perfect i think the pressure version of this rice cooker is overkill for me i dont need rice faster i want it perfect and this rice cooker delivers that perfectly every type every time highest recommendations worth every pennyits a perfect rice cooker buy it
4841,1,my camera worked great for about a week then it stopped adjusting to light no matter what setting i twist it to all my pictures come out a white blur of wasted moneystops working
4809,1,stopped working in less than  daysbroke pretty quickly
13283,2,working perfectly for over a year  cannot lose cooks rice perfectly every time i cook  cups at a time when we eat rice and freeze the leftover  in sandwich bags  minutes in the microwave and you have perfect hot rice without having to cook rice every timegreat value
3386,1,we got this for my son for his  birthday the piece that pulls the paper when printing broke the first day we ordered a replacement and the same piece broke on the replacement camera my son didnt even have either camera for over a day really disappointedbroke the same day it arrived
17396,5,my wife and i have been cooking rice in a  ply stainless steel pan on the stove for years thinking it was doing a good job it wasnt bad but sometimes hard to control we finally decided to buy a rice cooker i didnt want to go to walmart and buy a  rice cooker which would have been worse the the stove method after literally a month of reading blogs reviews on amazon and different cooking sites it pretty much came down to  rice cookers this one and the tiger  with the taccook function the amount of reviews for this vs anything tiger made was staggering plus the tiger model was almost  for a steaming function i ordered this zojirushi and the moment we opened the rice cooker when the time was up it was like this doesnt look like our rice cooked on the stove when we finally tried it it was like the other reviewers were right this is the best rice that we have ever made we have never had rice so fluffy we have tried the jasmine rice which is probably our favorite brown rice which is great as well its not chewy or too soft just perfect the gaba brown rice which for us was a little chewy but very good we have yet to make the multi grain rice black or red rice or sushi rice we will be making these soon and review them as well we have made both steel cut oat meal and old fashioned oats and they were amazing my wife poached a couple of fresh pears that she bought at kroger and they were so incredible yes its a rice cooker but i think with a little imagination we can make several different dishes in it i have to tell you two of the last kitchen appliances that we have purchased have been grand slams the first is the instant pot i dont know how we have got through all the years with out it it does have a rice setting on it and if you go to their website it shows you how to make good rice which actually wasnt as good as what my wife made on the stove and this zojirushi rice cooker this thing is just amazing if you like rice youll really love it cooked in this i think what makes it great is the induction heating and that its powered by a micom believe me it does make a differencethe more we use this i will update my review  rice taste any better then this
17065,4,"this is a review of the instant  rice cooker rice and grain multicooker with carb reducing technologyi initially had trouble with this cooker after  hours in carb reduce mode the rice was still dry i pinged instant and they asked me to add more water it was still dry for  cups of sona masoori rice  cups of water  and  hours laterfinally it needs a lot more water and the water level needs to rise to at least  inch above the rice level meaning this needs to fill a lot of the outer pot and then the inner carb reduce pot i stopped counting cups of water as it was indeed a lot i figured this out after watching youtube videos of similar japanese cookers they all have the marking levels in the inner pot which instant should add for this cooker then there would not be any confusion i have changed the review to  stars henceinner steel pot needs measurements"
12748,5,"it appears theres a part missing on the inner lid making it dare i say impossible to remove the inner lid for cleaning the diagram shows something called a steam cap which is also missing imagine my surprise when the inner lid release button doesnt actually release the inner lidheres the part where i make a fool of myself i went on to criticize their customer service as well as the product then i got a call from a very helpful cs rep who told me how to release the lid turns out i was pushing the wrong button pushed the correct one and the lid came right out hence the red facenow its time to say their customer service is outstanding and the rice cooker has worked perfectly ever sinceboy is my face red"
9113,1,order this in december just now went to use the film now i kept wondering why the images were not coming out clear or not at all till i checked the back of the box and saw i was sent expired film  make sure to check the date once you received your filmexpired film buyer beware
11274,4,it gets the job done super cute and matches my pink kitchen only reason that i didnt give it  stars its because in the instructions it says  cups but they wont cook all the way through if you put  cupsits cute but small thats what she said
1398,1,i use that phone i use that camera for only a day and i wasnt able to use it after that day because it blacked out i wasnt in any kind of body of water i wasnt in any kind of extreme heat nothing happened i didnt even drop it or anything it just blacked out and every picture i took was blue and blackone day
15017,5,excellent rice cooker i was a little skeptical because of the brand and price turns out this rice cooker is just as good if not better than the more common brand names  tiger ect no regrets here would purchase againbuy it
16122,2,i bought a new rice cooker because the plastic handle of my old one broke i didnt want to buy the same brand as i dont want to experience the same thing over again i bought this one because it is a known brand even though it is a little bit more expensive but i am not happy with how tiny it is when i opened it i was shocked with how tiny it is it is not a  uncooked rice cooker but  it is stated in the inner pan wrong advertisement please correct it attached is a picture of my old  uncooked rice cooker side by side the blackdecker i am not really happy as we dont like going through the hassle of returning stuffwrong information
15729,5,this is a great rice cooker for one person or a small family after a mishap with my previous rice cooker i definitely needed a new one this a great rice cooker for the price range it is ridiculously easy to use and clean and the anti slip bottom keeps it securely in place the steam basket is a nice touch if you want to steam veggies etc but for me it will only cooking the perfect bowl of riceperfect rice each time
12329,5,perfect size and a great pricewould recommendcookerrice
10127,5,"i use this in conjunction with a jackery  could probably run it off a ive made all kinds of stuff with it and i take it everywhere as im always car campingsmall and convenient"
15124,4,im happy with this rice cooker it has a pretty large capacity is very easy to clean and the steam vent stays fairly clean during the cooking process easy to program good features i wish it had a timer that would show me the remaining time from the start  but in all honesty i guess that is difficult to predict towards the end of the cycle it does show the remaining timeworks great
3976,1,i bought the camara for vacation and didnt work i change the battery and the photo cartridge and still nothingat first was great after like  use its stop working
5948,1,i would pass on this camera especially the quality of the pictures its not the best i wanted to try something more digital compared to what i have used in the past  instax  fuji film the fuji film camera is a much better quality for the price i thought it would be a good quality too the colors are so disoriented its easy to use no doubt but overall it couldve been betternot the best quality pass on this camera

9907,5,good productgood product
12088,4,i had an older and larger version of this rice cooker it worked on induction and worked very well this smaller new unit didnt make perfect rice as i was expecting it was either overcooked or needs less water i need to play with this unit and learn how to work with it clearly not what im used toinduction is better
17416,4,very easy to clean up but pay attention to the cleaning cotton used for cleaning the overall use is still very good the cooking time is relatively long the biggest disadvantage is that the sound is very loud when usingeasy to clean

11697,5,i eat rice everyday and i used to own a much smaller and lamer rice cooker my old one was never big enough so i decided to splurge and get this fancy thing and i really do love it guys i mostly just use it for steaming veggiesdumplings and making rice and my god it can make a lot of rice that bowl is huge but ive also made curry and soup in it before and it did a fantastic job i havent tried making yogurt but im certain itd make some mean yogurt its cool afone of the best appliances i own

10043,5,its perfect but it doesnt cook rice quickly i had a different rice cooker that cooked rice in  minutes this takes about  min to cook white rice ive never had a bad batch of rice follow the instructions and you should be fineexcellent

16273,4,this rice cooker works amazing cooks my white rice within fifteen minutes it is so delicious id would highly recommend its easy to use easy to clean and very versatileit works amazing 
15555,5,i grew up with rice cooked in a pot on the stove that if not properly attended would end up with a black layer and guess who washed the dishes several years ago i started using the instant pot to cook my rice which was a huge game changer but sometimes it was tied up making rice when i needed it to be cooking a main course this simple rice cooker is my new game changer just wash the rice i like basmati and jasmine  dump it in the ceramiccoated cooking pot add twice that amount of water  tsp salt and a pat of butter do a knuckle test to make sure the water is the right amount when your finger touches the rice the water should come to your first knuckle then place the pot in the cooker cover with the lid and push the lever to start it make sure that the cook button lights up rather than the keep warm one i think it remembers the last thing it was doing i didnt keep track of the time because i was doing chores in the kitchen but two cups uncooked was finished in under  minutes i never heard a beep initially i was concerned because the cooker was emitting a burning smell but i assumed it was one of those firstuse things and just stayed within arms length in case i needed to pull the power cord the rice was perfect and cleanup was a breeze i washed everything with warm soapy water and a spongeeasy does it
16993,5,you can make almost any meal in this thing it is absolutely incredible sear  braise  and slow cook  you will become an excellent cook amazing product just buy it
13576,5,"update its been  years with the new onejust as reliable and functional as the original no changes to my original comments i generally make only  cups of rice at a time ive made up to  cups without the splatter described by others maybe if i made  cups it would but you could cover the weep hole with a small cloth id recommend buying the bigger size if you are concerned still very happyi purchased my first zojirushi rice cooker over  years ago while stationed in japan the cooker worked unfailingly for over  years until this year as i searched for a replacement  reviewing the multitude of complex rice cookers  i realized what i wanted was the same cooker i had this is the model i wanted it to cook rice correctly in an timely mannerim not a rice connoisseurthe japanese take it to an art form so maybe the more complex machines result in a better dining experience for me this rice cooker delivers fluffy perfect rice every time i tend to cook about  cups dry volume rice each time add water add rice flip the lever to cook and in about  minutes i have great rice for dinner if thats what you need then this is the productdifferences from the original  interior is nonstick aluminum which is a huge improvement over the original bare aluminum rice doesnt stick there are markings in the pot to show where to fill the water  these are definitely harder to read with the nonstick coating its a bit of a pain but not a deal breaker lid is glass and has a small weep hole i read that this hole spits and made a mess this is not my experience at all in fact my old lid light aluminum no hole occasionally caused a small mess this does notive had this product now for  months its a simple cooker that works perfectly and exactly like the one i had for  years very very happythe best rice cooker for over  years"
3053,1,terrible video and photo qualitydont buy
9000,2,camera works great first few months than instantly breaks without any type of fall or drop i take camerea store and repair is very expensivebroke on me
3090,2,theres many ups and downs on this polaroid film u cant take pictures in a really bright area like being outside  if u are outside and you take a pic and then stay outside the photo film wil burn causing ur polaroid film pictures to be orange and red with a black dotso it sucks not being able to take pics outside without the film burning  you can also check my taking the film out your polaroid and flip it and see if theres a film thats orange and if there is a film thats orange that means its burnt andthat specific film wont work you will have to buy new film or use the other pack of  that it comes with  if ur polaroid pictures turn out redorange 
15839,5,there is four of us in my family and this rice cooker was able to hold enough for all of us it super easy to use and cleans up easily the ceramic coating is definitely a big plus very nice rice cookergreat for  people
17231,5,i love this pot i use it for everything from baking ribs to making flan you can even bake bread in it soup chili baked chicken you name itsuper usefull
10097,4,there is no way that small bowl can hold  chips of cooked rice this thing is teeny tiny for a rice eating family or just will not serve our needs going to return it for a hopefully bigger onesmaaaaall
4091,2,struggled for years to get system to work correctly hours on phone to get geofencing to operate correctly never did slow video upload  minute lag when intruder tried to break in to garage app lock ups app  phone restarts when trying to set or disarm system app restarts to try and get cloud storage to bring up past  days recordings when i know they are there etcnow turns out the company used false advertising to get me to purchase product i only tried the product bc arlo said it would give  days free cloud recording the product is useless without it arlo however is now removing that cloud storage through and end of life policy that violates the initial purchase promise you can buy a subscription for cloud but its like someone selling you a car and then telling you a few years later you need to pay them a monthly fee in order to start it fool me oncearlo will let you down
10511,5,bought this for deployment and it was really easy and simple to use cleaning was easy its non stick so i was able to clean and rinse great purchase and highly recommend for anyone who doesnt cook rice or know how to even startsimple and easy

5715,1,although it said it was compatible with my camera no matter what i tried it didnt workwouldnt work
5845,1,this is an outdated model and is not supported by customer servicethere is no software to download if you are using a chromebook as your computerdont buy if using a chromebook
13653,4,"to preface im an asian who grew up always eating rice so when i moved out i was keen on getting a cheap but decent rice cooker asap ive had it for a little under a year now and for comparison ill use my parents cuckoo  which ive always likedi wasnt expecting much out of this rice cooker when i bought it due to the price but i trust zojirushi so i had my fingers crossed overall its a good purchasegood points of the zojirushi consistently wellcooked rice very easy to use just put rice water and then flip the switch is obvious when it is on red light emits wellpriced cheap has lasted longer than i expected easy to clean except for the first bad pointbad points has an issue with water bubblingspilling out the top sometimes along the steam escape hole and sides of the lid which is annoying and messy countertop on which it stands ends up wet and sticky with rice water have to use a cloth to prevent this from making a mess good point it doesnt happen always mostly only when cooking smaller amounts of rice no warm option so any rice you cook will get cold if you leave it in the cooker means you have to either freezereheat the rice or cook new rice every time occasionally rice is very watery after it is finished cooking but it quickly becomes the right consistencytexture once taking it out of the pot to coolfor the personfamily that doesnt often eat rice this is a great purchase the downsides are so minor that you wont notice them if youre only using this occasionally the price is good it is a very basic rice cooker but it is consistent reliable and sturdyhowever for the personfamily that often eats rice this might become annoying as it has for me im looking into getting a cuckoo with a warming function in the futureworks but not optimal"
1698,1,bought it bc tiktok was raving about the camera it must have been paid promotion or something because this camera has the worst quality ive ever seen the lenses dont change anything my laptop has better camera qualityits a no for me
12282,5,huge improvement over cheap cookers that simply turn off when the water is all boiled away rice comes out perfect every time the keep warm setting is a bit more hit and miss sometimes the rice gets crusty by the next morning ive reverted to simply saving it in an airtight container in the fridge and reheating but thats a pretty small complaint for cooking rice this thing is greatperfect rice
13337,5,"for a big family gatheringthis rice cooker will not let you down easy to clean and great affordable pricesimple and affordable"
7441,1,this product was very disappointing for its price the quality is old and overall a bad cameranot goodcheap bad quality
11403,5,i live alone and this is perfect for me rice came out perfect as well with the finger rule would totally recommendperfect
6278,2,if youre expecting the same kind of product as the calibrite passport with a hard plastic exterior but larger youll be very disappointed this product is based on a flimsy card that is not durable and there is nothing to protect the color swatches so it gets  stars they have now released a folio case but thats just a denier nylon holder which is also floppy  flimsy and does not offer the stiff protection that a hard plastic case would offer like the smaller passport im not sure what they are thinking im thinking this was a better company when it was xriteflimsy
16616,5,love this product we make rice a lot and this is flawlessgreat rice cooker
4619,2,i bought this to use with my cell phone the usb c end it too short to connect to the phone if your phone is in a caseworks well with a laptopusb c too short
10085,5,super easy to use and put in the proper amount of water to make perfect rice since its marked the bowl used to cook the rice is non stick so stirring and scooping out rice is super easy any loose rice grains come right out with water alone when cleaning making the cleanup very easy the timer doesnt show the total amount of time it will take which may be because of the easy function to put in however much rice you need and cook with only one button but it will tell you when there are ten minutes leftperfect rice every time
17348,5,"my first experience with a zojirushi rice cooker was with the  model which unfortunately was defective and stuck in full  power mode it destroyed all every kind of rice i tried despite following all suggestions from customer supportthat said i traded that model in for this one plus a few  and now have the precision machine that i was looking for rice made following the same instructions that yielded horrible results using the previous machine is now spot on from nishiki sushi rice kokuho yellow brand and tilda basmati each one came out perfect following the basic directions for each type using this machinethe answer to all rice problems"
5997,1,gopro makes fine cameras but beware the subscription scam they will get their money no matter the cost i will never buy another gopro after this onebad company
4225,1,actually was unable to use the camera had two batteries that came with camera and neither one would hold a charge long enough to take just a few photos then it would this was very frustrating because i was on a trip to italy and pictures by a camera and not a phone return by date had passed by the time i got home or i would have asked for a refundbattery would not hold charge
15646,5,this electric rice cooker is perfect for college students ppl who dont know how to cook rice an those who are lazy cooks like me as i mentioned earlier it is electric has an inner nonstick pot an comes with a spoon measuring cup just for the rice an it even includes a small cookbook the rice cooker is big enough to holdcook three cups of uncooked rice that will make six cups of cooked rice it will automatically turn itself into the warm position once the rice is fully cooked an done so no worries of having over cooked an sticky rice it also has only one simple onoff buttonrice lovers
11134,5,love this thing you can steam a lot of stuff at one time no mess easy to clean looks goodgonna be hard to beat this far better than i expected
14528,4,this works really well until the bowl gets bent on the bottom then it cooks unevenlyworks great for a time
3810,2,just bought this camera for my grandson when recording video the audio is just static uno voices come through would love some tech support on this issuejust static on audio when using video
7484,1,if you buy more than one be advised they may be completely different from each other ive bought  only two are alike two record in a weird format that creates tons of files of very large size  record in the file size and format you would expect one has a rolling shutter effect and poor video quality even though the hz is set correctly one has sparklish pixels in the video and had poor video quality one the microphone doesnt work they are cheap you get what you pay for they are in no way  contacted the company they replied quickly but i had to jump through all kinds of hoops they wanted videos of the issues version numbers and of course the amazon order  then i had to pack up the camera with the original box and all pieces and pay for return shipping so their technician could verify my claim i still havent seen the credit on my accountok product ive had issues with  if the  ive bought
9179,1,i am editing this review from august as the situation is now much worsedo not buy from this company since i posted this review they have done nothing but harass me with daily emails to remove this honest review of the camera they tried to bribe me to remove it with promises of a  amazon gift card and i cannot get them to stopcamera freezes every several photos requiring the battery to be removed to reset i purchased this camera for my  year old daughter and cant have her constantly pulling the battery unfortunately she didnt start using it until after the return window closedconstantly freezes
9183,1,i work in law enforcement and i wanted a camera that was cheap enough to not be a big deal if it breaks the price on this was good and i was hoping i could use this for taking pictures of documents instead of writing everything down on paper but i received it and tested it out and the image quality is so bad that you can not read anything in the pictures i will keep looking for a better patrol camera this is certainly not a  mp cameracertainly not a  mp camera
14749,5,ive used this for jasmine rice and glutinous rice for sweet sticky mango rice and both were perfect the jasmine rice stayed edible and tasty for almost  days which is a feat for rice i even tried it cold out of the fridge and it was still soft and tastyrice cooking game changer
16497,5,easy to usegood
15896,5,the rice cooker is so easy to use and clean it makes great rice i like it and wish i bought a bigger onemakes great rice
2833,1,my daughter took this camera to science camp last week and it erroredcrashed on her and she lost all her pictures and videos while on the bus home talk about utter devastation her firstever trip away from home  nothing to remember it by you get what you pay for i can not say with certainty if it was the camera software or the shitty ass memory card i assume it was the memory card because it gave me an error message when i put it on my computer to check the memory card has no brand name on it so it is some cheap trashi plan to try a namebrand microsd card in it and see how it handlesmemory card is trash
16427,5,im not much of a rice eater but my german shepherd dog requires special diet and thats the reason why i bought this rice cooker this rice cooker lasted me  months it was well worth the money because i cooked in that rice cooker once twice a day everyday for  months i got more than got my moneys worth out of it it is an excellent rice cooker thank you black  deckerexcellent product
15371,5,love it it cooks just like advertised very happygoluckyit works better than other multicookers
15902,5,size is good for two rice comes fluffy really enjoy my purchasegreat size
16392,5,"this is my third rice cooker over the past ten years due to moving around not bc they died i normally purchase the cheapest simplest ones and ive always been more or less happy with them however our last one used to burn the rice on the bottom when left on the warm setting too long after cooking the rice also possibly due to british voltage i learned to live with it but it wasnt idealweve used this rice cooker twice for japanese rice i have yet to test it with jasmine and its been great wash rice thoroughly  make sure your ratios are correct my partner was against me getting it in the first place bc its easy enough to cook on the stove but hes a convert and it is nice to be able to set it and forget it while you concentrate on cooking the other parts of your meali accidentally purchased the smallest size which was far too small for our  meals i usually like to have some leftover for fried rice i can see why some folks might say that water spurted out  it is super tiny probably ideal for one person preparing one cup of uncooked rice we ended up sending it back and upgrading to the next size which i think is perfect for  mealsits a bit of a wide pot in terms of design  wider than our last two models which is my only complaint thus far as we have limited counter space however my partner likes the design and it seems to work as intended seems like a good deal for the price easy to clean easy to use definitely an essential appliance in our kitchenim a fan so far  does what it should"
10766,5,love this little thing it is so simple and produces great results got the  cup and its great for  people rice comes out perfectgreat product
5366,1,i purchased this item on dec  after using it for less than  months it broke all my photos are blurry and have distortions and blobs i dont recommend this productit broke after  months of use
4189,2,i got this for a gift initially i purchased from this vendor due to the product image showing  packs of instant film i discovered after receiving the package it is only  or  i was rather disappointed not sure why they would have a misleading image like that in addition it seems kind of suspect to include a half opened pack of filmim hoping that the lifetime of the camera does not live up to some of the negative reviews if it works out well id be willing to leave a  or  starproduct image shows twice the amount of film received
2052,2,everyone i talked to about polaroid said they loved the brand and that i would too i guess either they dont know me very well or we have completely different tastes because this camera isnt my style the photographs are such low quality i dont know why anyone would want themlow quality photos
12732,5,with the saute feature i was able to make perfect mexican rice always wanted a cooker with fuzzy logicit really works to create rice as it should be served oatmeal making is just a bonus easy to read measurements inside the cooker ensures perfect resultsuse it daily
3649,1,stop working after  months i took maybe  pictures terrible lifespannot working after using  months
13578,5,decided to give this rice cooker a second chance this time i rinsed the rice until my skin started to wrinkle but apparently thats what has to be done no spitting water and no mess on my counter this time i still wish it had a chime to let you know when the rice is done especially for the price but all in all this is an excellent rice cooker simple to use nothing fancy about it which is what i loved about my hitachi chime o matic press one button and done now if it last more than  years like my hitachi didrereview from spits everywhere
13630,5,"i just wanted to add my two cents to help offset some of the negative reviews i bought this particular cooker due to the positive reviews both here and on some other websites i wanted a cooker due to being tired of cooking potatoes with most meals and getting tired of them i received the unit very quickly and immediately tried it out i wanted to try brown rice first so i washed it briefly and put it in the machine to cook shortly a mass of bubbles filled below the lid and started sputtering through the steam hole not happy about the mess it was making i endured it and ended up eating some fairly good rice with my first meal i thought yeah they were right its messy what a bummer so round two and three i cooked some more this time trying varieties of white rice and both resulting in a repeat of the first messy attempt along with some browning of the rices on the bottom of the pan again i thought this is no fun friends or guests are going to think this is a piece of junk by this time i had been reading quite a bit on the net about rice and concluded that a more thorough rinsing of the grains were in order so my fourth round started off with such along with an accurate measurement of rice and water anda pat of butter thrown ini thought maybe it might help it from sticking or browning in the bottom the resultperfect rice im now making that my preparation regimen and im getting better results each time im convinced that the errors others are reporting are not the machines fault and im also convinced that like most other machines the user needs to figure out how to use it in a short time a person should be able to make perfect rice repeatedly to help the bottomsticking im also now opening the lid and giving a couple of stirs a couple of times through the cooking cycle also note like others have said that washing the rice is a must maybe up to and including soaking but i havent tried that yet as you are washing off a lot of the starch that helps make the mess in the first place take note of the type of rice you buy some rices have been stripped of their vitamins and have them sprayed back on the bags will have instructions on them telling you to not wash the rice i would avoid those types i have yet to steam veggies or whole meals in it but im sure i can get good results from it just as wellgood luck and good healthupdate  years later absolutely one of the best electronic kitchen gadget purchases ive ever made we use it quite a lot and its consistentok  years later and its still the bomb yes i did try some veggies in the top tray along with some fish and they worked out just finewhat rice againyou bet"
9415,5,cookie perfect white rice every timeperfect rice cooker
11853,4,the product is beautiful and looks just like the picture looks and feels very highquality durable and the stainless steel modern look is sleek however the directions that come with it were super unhelpful and i often dont even need a recipeinstruction manual but it was confusing i have used it a few times for soup and rice playing it somewhat by ear and my stuff has always come out pretty well with it anyway though so it does function quite well and after having it for several months they have recently come out with updated instructions if you get instructions that are unclear and dont come with recipes look online for the product and download the updated pdf manual from the website i appreciate that they have listened to some feedback i look forward to trying some of the recipes now that i understand what all the lights means and how long things should typically take in it all of the pieces come clean very easily for me and i do still like it very much despite the confusionproduct is beautiful and works but directions are terrible
11420,5,super cute and comes apart for easy cleaninglove it
11834,4,its a great product but when a recipe calls for setting the slow cooker on high or low i have no idea what its cooking at because you cant adjust the temperature now im just doing trial and error which kind of sucksslow cooker setting
10154,5,so you do need to follow the directions and rinse the rice well and measure correctly it took me a couple times to perfect this but now its so easy and the rice comes out perfect every time no more guessing or mushy rice or under cooked set it and forget iteasy and perfect rice every time
4649,1,the usb c side does not work right something is messed up when i plug it i to my note  it keeps saying usb is controlled by connected device which should be my phone as it is the only connected terrible it wont let me change the functions the normal usb side might work but it wont work for what i need it for i need it to be able to take pictures on my nikon  and pop out the sd card put it in the usb c reader and transfer the photos to my phone so i can then use ebay mobile and list my items for my buisness this will not do thatthis thing is a piece if garbage the usb c does not work with my note 
3997,1,the photos come out very dark and sometimes just all black very disappointedpictures are very dark
10116,5,if you eat a lot of rice this is essential we use it  times a week and its great for using the timer function for breakfast or if you want fresh rice for your lunch that day it also steams vegetables really wellessential
11450,5,versatile and attractive on the counterversatile
11044,5,we bought this at the last minute to try to eat healthy we use it at least  time a week very easy use and perfect rice every time just set it and forget it with no boil over like on the stove topso convenient
7431,1,pictures are barely even visible horriblehorrible quaility
368,1,it is not as pictured the zoom does not work well every picture is grainy  zoomed or not i would not recommend this for any onenot worth it
8427,2,they work fine but arent amazing most polaroids come out with cleaner images than these dopoor photo quality
3256,2,ended up returning it was very disappointed with the picture qualitynot what i was expecting
16849,4,i love this rice cooker but for me was difficult to understand i think they should have made like easier buttons etcits a litte difficult to get used to
11877,5,"fantastic product makes rice and other grains even sausage and peppers it knocked out the best sausage in under an hour could easily cut them with a fork bye bye crockpothave a hard time figuring out all the bells and whistles so ive cooked everything on the white rice option and added more time as needed also forgot about my rice on day timer showed it had been on warming option for  minutes but when i opened the lid expecting disaster all i found was perfectly cooked rice and the steamer bowl worked great for steaming veggies and dumplings even experimented with making a pudding cake turned out greatperfect for summer as it doesnt heat up my kitchen compact and mobile so it doesnt take up much counter space and easily fits in my pantry clean up is a sinch if it ever dies from overuse im definitely buying another one this is a must have for my kitchen plus i have more room in my pantry since i got rid of my dumpling steamer both crock pots and  pans ranks right up there with my electric kettle love this productnot just for making rice  better than a crockpot"
5373,1,the first few photos came out well but every photo afterwards comes out black i looked on google to see why this is happening ive made sure no lights or anything is being covered google suggests the shutter isnt working properly defectivedefective
14116,2,"after a recent rice debacle i decided that i had enough and getting a rice cooker was a must for my sanity i have only made white rice so far but both batches came out as expected and took about  minswhat i like the color love it much better than the basic white of other cookers handle super convenient capacity just right for a household of  i like that it cooks double the amount of other mini cookers without having a larger form factor price reasonable and wont break the bank cord is detachablewhat i dont like the cord wish it was double the length user manual is very basic and bare bones and doesnt specify ratio of rice to water opening the lid the amount of water that drips from the top of the lid when opening is ridiculous it goes all over the machine and on the counter even after letting it sit for  or more minutes after it has finished cooking the buttons i cannot read them at all i have tried different angles but nothing works paddle wish it was a tad shorter so it would fit inside the bowl for ease of storagewhile this machine does what it is intended to do the inability to read the buttons is a deal breaker for me and i will be returning very sad as this is one of the more attractive units and has a handle which most others lackso close to being great"
11326,1,it says its ceramic its not standard non stockwarning not ceramic
1289,1,i disliked the fact that the camera does not work does not hold a chargethe camera does not work
3736,2,i dont likevery difficult and bad quality
921,1,the usb charger that comes with the camera does not work now i have a useless camera on me because the battery wont chargeusb does not work do not buy
17492,5,"i was really hesitant with the price but am pleased that i spent the money for this quality rice cooker it looks amazing easy to clean and fairly easy to use pretty much just keep hitting the button until the rice option you want lights upwas interested in this rice cooker as this heatscooks the rice through an induction system so no direct heating source white rice will usually take about an hour we leave it on warm pretty much when there is rice in there this help eliminate the water condensation in the pot rice is still moist at least two days before it get drier we also use at least  tsp of vinegar to help to keep it from spoiling quicklythe pot is extremely easy to clean we try to let it cool down before cleaning everything wipes off fairly easily with no scrubbingthere are some other options on it and will have to research as it seems you can cook other things with it also very worth the purchase of the rice cookerwonderful rice cooker"
16280,4,i liked the design of this rice cooker very muchexcelent cooking if cooked with the instructions given like quantity of rice and water i also cooked momos dumplings and it was preety goodi dont have much complaintsexcellent
14501,5,nothing ever really sticks to it so easy to clean works very well about  minutes to cook  cups of riceeasy to clean
12532,5,love that i dont have to watch a pot for boiling over or dryness also cooks faster than stovetop a great toolquick and simple to use
16772,5," unlike all other traditional rice cookers this rice cooker is compact sleek and functional it has a few more buttons than the usual flip switch  so you can select what type of rice you will be using cooked  cups of uncooked jasmine rice and the video shows you the amount of space left insidecouple design flaws that may or may not be dealbreaker for others  cooker may topple back when you press button to open lid  solution hold top lid as you press button as i did on the video  no handles to make it easy to grasp or hold if you want to move it  solution still able to hold it like a planter or carry it with arms around itfunctional  stylish"
8853,2,the camera is sturdy and comes with quite a few accessories which is a great value as far as picture quality goes it is subpar none of the photos taken were in focus or crisp no matter the setting the colors were washed out no matter the setting any photo i took required editing to even make it usable my  android phone takes better pictures im so disappointedhorrible focus
1141,1,so this is a used item i thought i was buying new since thats what i selected the battery pack that came with the box is missing the charger cord so im afraid to use it before my event that i purchased it for i dont want to drain the battery and then not have a way to recharge itmissing item and used product
12371,5,we bought this as a graduation gift for a friend because we have this exact one and love it it is the perfect size for making rice for just one or two people or up to five people when pairing with a dinner dish it is relatively fast at making the rice and the instructions for using it are very easy and straightforward it makes the rice well cooked but not too watery every time the base where the rice goes is also nice in that we just throw it in our dishwasher to wash itonly way we make rice
8511,1,i am currently traveling with my girlfriend and i have an unhappy girlfriend because of the defective battery charger that comes with the camera flashing light tested it before the tripunfortunately i am not in a position to return fortunately i am near china where i can just order replacement parts cheap from the sourceunusable battery charger after  use
3758,1,this camera was bought as a gift a year ago when we couldnt get it to work after a few days it was placed on a shelf and forgotten about had i dealt with it at that time i probably could have returned it for a refund or better camera but you live and learnmy child had a renewed interest this week so i finally decided to sit down and figure it out the memory card that i was disappointed to have to buy separately was protected or locked i did everything humanly possible to unlock it but nothing worked got a new sim card  exact same problem both cards worked fine in another camera but remained locked in this one rendering the camera unusablealso the  batteries died very quickly and i had to buy a charger for them  another sunk cost now that i cant get the camera workingnever got it to work
1869,1,i ordered this product and when it arrived it was missing half the items and the box showed signs of being used i would not recommend because it took a week to arrive and was missing so many piecesmissing pieces
3562,1,possibly i received a defective camera but after charging it i tried to turn it on and after  attempts it worked but later when i tried to turn it on it did not want to turn onafter charging the unit didnt turn on
4211,2,i used this for about a month and then it stopped working so now i have all this film and stickers because i got the bundle and paid  i really dont want to spend another  dollars on the camera itself just so i can use the rest of the film pretty bummed because my boyfriend and i were using it for our couple challenge book and the camera only worked for  challenges out of  last long
16452,5,"so this thing is great you put in your ingredients power on and let it do its thing its a nonstick surface in the bowl with embossed measuring gradients inside they arent the easiest to see but you can get used to it the package comes with a rice spoon and lid the lid has a tiny hole to let steam escape the spoon is nothing special just plasticin the instructions it states to not lift the lid after its done cooking but wait for another  mins youll know when its done as the click of the switch is audible and is accompanied by a light showing its keeping it warmcleanup is easy enough i dont like nonstick surfaces to be washed in the dishwasher i was the bowl lid and spoon by hand if the rice bakes on the manual states to let it soak in hot water for a few minutesall in all its a great unit with a capacity that is just enough for my family it stores easy and cleans easy the rice comes out nice and sticky cooked all the way through the price is reasonable and i gave it a shot i am glad i did i make rice all the time now it comes out the same every timegreat for tiny apartment and  people"
5935,1,gave it a one star because the case for the camara was missing from the packagegave it a one star because the case for the camara was missing from the package

7611,1,unless you plan on putting your subject within  inches of the light this thing is useless it barely glows the taller tripod is nice but thats the only feature that i would use and what i need is lightbarely glows
14818,5,this unit makes making rice easy try itwant rice
9016,1,nearly  and it doesnt even have mic input the joke is one me i suppose for expecting the most basic utility the focusing dial on the macro lens is also unresponsive nothing but a blurred messno mic input really
17704,5,i originally bought this for my  year old to make perfect rices which it makes all types perfectlyjust choose the rice when u start it but now i use it every morning for my oatmealoatmeal too
288,1,weighs alot more than other cameras and with less zoom biggest problem it overheats i took it to myanmar for a month and yes its hot thereso the camera basically kept shutting off this is not a good thing for a travel camera too heavy and too much electronics made it a lousy travel camera my nikon  is much lighter always works long battery time is a better travel camera the reason i chose the lumix was it was supposed to be better in darker situations it is as long as it hasnt overheated and turned itself offthis is not a good thing for a travel camera
9674,5,the price made me skeptical but it works so well cheap price for a great productvery practical
60,2,purchased three of these  for grandchildren twins age  flash is just a dim led always on if set and doesnt do anything like a real flash supposed zoom is digital meaning it loses pixels as you zoom may as well wait till cropping the picture when printing one lost all sound after a month other was dropped with no visible damage but stopped working cant really complain about thaton the positive side it comes with  batteries then again no external charger  you must charge in the camera with the usb charger provided so cant charge one battery while using the otherall in all a mediocre first camera for an older child since they dont sell lowmedium priced digital cameras anymore i guess everyone switched to using their phoneno flash no real zoom lost sound after a month
100,2,we bought this camera for our  year old daughter as an introduction to photography the build quality feels very cheap and the display screen is very grainy the controls are pretty simple so its good for a youngster to use the battery doesnt seem to last very long on a change but at least it came with two batteries the biggest let down its the flash its not a flash its a flashlight thats either on all the time or off cheap flashes have been in disposable cameras for  years why cant we put one in this camera i would not buy this camera again or suggest it to a friendi guess you get what you pay for
6978,1,camera does not work it is corroded and was just thrown in the box with original batteries rolling around the bottom it also has sand all over it extremely disappointedsold a broken camera
9812,4,this is versatile and easy to use makes a variety of rices and grains definitely rinse the rice  times to avoid mushiness as others have saidversatile and easy to use
12900,5,absolutely love this rice cooker it makes a large quantity of rice and cooks it to perfection keeps it wa for day so easy to use and very intuitive cleans up super fast and easy one of the best rice cookers i have ever had multiple settings great machine doesnt take up a lot of room highly recommendperfect rice cooker
11090,5,"for most of my life my experience with rice has been of the minute rice variety but i decided if i was going to start buying the less expensive regular rice i might as well go ahead and buy a rice cooker i didnt want to spend a bunch of money on something that was as of yet unproven to me and this one had a pretty fair amount of reviews and it was definitely inexpensive so far i have cooked white rice brown rice and quinoa i would have to say that its been a resounding success i still have to play with the water levels a little bit with a quinoa because it is a little bit different than rice but im still very pleased with how it turned out with people that have trouble with the stuff coming out of the cooker and making a mess all i can figure is that theyre using way too much the first thing is to only use that little cup that comes with it theyre one cup is actually equal to about  of one of our normalcups and is big and fluffy is the quinoa cooked up i could very easily see how if you were to load up three even if the proper size cups in that unit that it would definitely blow all over the place i added one of the cups that came with the machine and it easily filled the container halfway up and something else that i do besides just cooking rice is i will add vegetables into the steamer tray and i will mix those with a rice or the quinoa is this cooker the best thats available no im sure that its not however i can say that it does exactly what i want to do and is easy to clean up is it going to last me  years no probably not but im happy enough with this unit that even if i have to replace it in  months i would not hesitate to do soupdatestill the best money i have spent in agesi have added split peas and lentils to the list of things i have cooked in this no soaking etc just dump in a cup the supplied one and  that amount of water that works very well for about everything except white rice you might get some scorching in the bottom but it comes out so easyi have been using this at work both to save money and eat healthier brown rice and either lentils or split peas have been my preference the last week then i put a  bag of frozen vegetables in the steamer tray green beans peas and carrots or mixed vegetables are my preference in that order then a diced up onion then a diced jalapeno pepper the final thing that makes it so good is a tsp of chicken base to the water in the lower rice cooker bowl better than bouillon low sodium is my choice its so good mixed together and seasoned with hidden valley spicy ranch dressing powder i did the math and figured that im eating a healthy and delicious lunch for less than  a week cant beat itim eagerly awaiting a container of low sodium ham base i ordered online i think that will be amazing if i use it to cook split peas and mix that with green beans and onionsi will know in about a weeklove this thing"
10336,5,bought this rice cooker on my wifes suggestion love it not just for rice but for other dishes like soups and beans load it set it and walk away couldnt ask for more simplicity and quality resultseasy to use  great results

12302,5,"overview  backgroundboth model sizes are best for  servings mainly for individuals couples a bit more can be squeezed out of them if servings are kept smallercovers most cooking even baking style options except for much higher temperature sort of cookingbaking like frying broiling grilling roasting these types of cooking methods are best done in another higher temperature usually  watts if electric powered appliance like a regular range stove top grill or the portable stove tops sometimes called a hot platei did not just buy one but two black and decker rice cookersthough a month apart from each other they are the smallest  and the second smallest  models which are currently offered on their present model line up i will discuss them both here equally in the overview  background section then in their respective individual model sections i will discuss each one separately in far more detail overall i have found them both to be so very adaptable flexible and meeting my food preparation and nutrition needs very well sometimes exceeding my own wildest dreams as these cookers are definitely not a one trick pony i bought them both because the huge global inflation that is causing food prices to skyrocket without an end in sight and the global supply chain breakdown which has impacted plus severely limiting packaged frozen food for individuals and smaller groups to my local grocery stores in a dependable predictable and timely mannerwhile i usually prepare a  pot meal or snacks using just one rice cooker at a time when cooking just for me both of them can be used to make not only more food but a variety of food when neededgenerally one to two servings i can feed up to about  servings depending on the size of the portion served separately intended for each person these cookers take very little space either when stored or in use they are very inexpensive together i paid under  dollars for both at the time of this writing and with the right recipes and ingredients can do a wide variety of main and side dishes with so little clean up afterwards when you do clean up the inner pot use only soft nonabrasive sponge rag wet paper towels etc or soak in soapy water before you start to wipe clean plus never use metal utensils in these cookers or you will ruin the nonstick cooking surface it is very easy to scratch it completely dry the insert itself before placing it back into the electric basei had an unexpected side benefit of lower salt intake as well as consuming more nutritious food of grains other than the expected rice vegetables and controlling meat amount inclusion which helped me to lose  pounds without even knowing it they are ultra portable and can be moved from not only from room to room but travel if i ever do that againi am a single person on the snap food stamps program right now i am on a very limited food budget of hovering just under  dollars per month that means i have to be very careful even before this huge inflation wave happened while i always hunted for bargains used store discount cards and coupon clipped in the past that proved not to be enough anymore especially now with the double whammy of inflation and supply breakdown i decided i need to eliminate food waste as close to  as possible so i purchased the tiny  first with my stimulus check i noticed such a huge drop in waste approaching the upper  percentile i decided to buy the  a bit later as it is the smallest model to offer an included steam basket plus i needed a bit more room for a little more food this combo proved to be the best means to reach even exceed my goalsreasons to buy anyall of these rice cookersrice cookers can be used in less than ideal situations if you dont have a traditional kitchen available and need to set up some sort of makeshift portabletemporarytransitoryeven an emergency sort of meal prep area station or center all you need is a reliable power source preferably an electrical outletotherwise a generator to power up and operate the cookers  is only  watts and  is  watts so easy on electricity unlike the higher wattage appliances out thereaddressing special dietary issues if you or someone in your group has a special diet be prepared just for them it is very easy to do in a rice cooker such as these even if you visit outside your home or residence at someone elses place it can be easily done right on the spot especially great for diabetics people with food allergies personalreligious belief dietary restrictions ie veganism keeping kosher etc you will still be able to dine with others without calling undue attention to the food in front of you just like everyone elsefaster than a slow cooker most meals average around  minutes or sonot heating up the kitchen when the weather is very hot especially hot and steamy times of the yeareasy to use only  device operating or control lever and ability to prepare as simple or elaborate mealssnacks as you wantcheap on the food budget without sacrificing nutrition  proportion control practiced without undercutting with a decent amount of food per person leftovers eliminated unless intentionally desired by the usernumerous rice cooker recipes available both online at your local public library and in purchased cookbooks specializing in preparing raw ingredients in a rice cooker i collected several books and searched online and i now have a huge selection of entrees to choose from just like eating out in a restaurantwithout the costthe smallest and cutest model offered it does not come with a steamer basket still it is great for very small proportions like a side dish or a snack i cooked white rice in it just for me and it came out perfect just remember to use the included rice measuring cup and the spatulaspoonscoop included in your box for best resultsthe included rice measuring cup is great for rice measuring accuracy within this rice cooker unless otherwise specified by your chosen recipe then i use the regular cups used by most people the usual regular measuring cups might make your rice overflow as it is somewhat bigger than the included rice measuring cupthis is the one size up model i usually prepare my main  pot course a bit bulkier items like ribs shown being prepared and served in the included photos and could be pressed to squeeze out an extra proportion for an unexpected guest far easier than the micro mini  the included steamer basket allows me to steam a little something extra within it without having to use my little  all the time just for a very small extra amount of food just remember to use the spatulaspoonscoop plus the rice measuring cup included in your box for best resultsthe included rice measuring cup is great for rice measuring

11067,5,"i helped my neighbor order his new rice cooker that was largely based upon my experience using my rice cooker to steam veggies i was never satisfied throwing the broccoli into the skillet next to my chicken breast since i and my neighbor are both diabetics discovering how great the broccoli and cauliflower are when steamed in the rice cooker was a big event if you are not a diabetic you may not understand such excitement i pray that you never will be eating food that is low in the glycemic index is crucial to us being able to prepare a meal quickly that tastes great is a real blessing the best part of steaming the vegetables is that they will stay hot in the cooker until you can get the other dishes prepared that has been a very big plus for me nobody likes cold veggies my neighbor feels the same way i picked one out for him but it turns out that mine is an  cup model his is only a six cupper but he is happy with it nonetheless since he lives alone most of his cooking is just for himself a family should probably look for an  cup machine or largerthis is john again if you will be steaming veggies as i am almost every night serve them with soy sauce also  the next time pour bbq sauce over the raw veggies in the basket or do a shake  bake like the old days just put the uncooked veggies in a ziploc bag with some bbq sauce to coat everything the food will taste great and your home will smell like your neighborhood bbq restaurantfor a healthier you"

15504,4,"this is a tiny rice cooker that makes plenty of rice for  people the ceramic coating is really thin and i am not sure how it will hold up over time ill update if i notice any peeling or flakingwe made mexican rice in it and it worked well i added the oil and held the button down until the oil was hot added the rice diced oniona garlic and tomatoes pressed the button down and sauteed until it was toasty added the tomato paste and chicken stock stirred out the lid on and clicked down the cook leverin about  minutes i had great rice gave it a fluff and it was ready to go hubs said it was deliciousjust like every other rice cooker with the push down button the rice gets crusty on the bottom in the keep warm position it wasnt burnt but if i would have left it any longer it would have been it has a vent s glass lid that is great for viewing the rice or other grains the paddle is extremely cheap not any better than throw away plastic utensils but it did a great job of not scratchingthe coating overall this is a solid  rating and the small size is handy cant wait to make my macaroni and cheese in itnice tiny spacesaving rice cooker"
12214,4,pleased with purchase however you could very likely get the same results in a less expensive model depending upon the intended usegood purchase
16669,4,"when i first bought this i was excited bc its a cuckoo and it cooked the rice just fine but takes about  mins for  cups of rice depending on setting however the measurements inside the bowl are so hard to see bc its black on black  bad designbut sadly it hasnt been a year yet and the warm function is already ruining my cooked rice after  hours the rice starts to smell and turn yellow bc the warm function becomes too hot and starts to overcook the cooked rice that should just be warmdo not recommend this particular rice cookerits okay but wouldnt recommend"
16271,5,i got the  cup really small good for  or  people max i use a little more water than what is recommended but this cooks the rice perfect and fluffy ive had  other rice cookers and some of them suck and overcook the rice if you dont unplug them this one works great and makes really good rice but if you are cooking for a family or group  get one of the bigger oneshappy works great and super small
17735,4,i bought this product and it lasted only one year i contacted the customer care and they want me to sent to some nonsense repairing company in new york its been over a month and i have not heard from them  i will not recommend this product and will never ever buy this product i will not recommend this product to anyone the money you spend on this product does not worth it 
17530,5,"my wife gave me a very hard time about spending this much on an appliance that should cost  at most her wordsso against her wishes i splurged and got my dream rice cooker the first night we got it i cooked jasmine rice more grumbling about how long it took to cookan hour for jasmine rice not my best sales pitch but then i asked her to describe her rice experience with the cheaper cooker uneven cooking wet spots etc fast forward to an hour laterperfect rice what perfect rice worth the wait she saysthe next we went to the store what other kinds of should we try she asks what about that gaba brown rice no problem we waited two hours for that batch but it was even better than the first what about grits she is from georgia no problem i even found a recipe for grits casserole in the rice cooker what about parboiled rice she has now ventured out on her own i believe we now have five different kinds of rice in our cabinet all have their own setting and all come out perfectno more do i hear discussion about cheaper rice cookers that dont perfectly steam the rice this device delivers perfection and keeps rice for days on the extended warm setting im not kidding five days i cant say enoughbottom line spend the money get the larger model explore new rices smile one of my best purchasesyes its worthy of the hype yes perfect rice is possible even likely"
9829,5,ive had this rice cooker for about  months and have absolutely no issues with it i cook a lot of rice and no longer worry about my rice burning or boiling over rice whether brown white jasmine risotto you name it comes out perfect every time probably one of the best investments ive made in small kitchen appliancesgreat rice cooker
4148,1,the pictures were not good and it would die every  seconds even after charging itnot what i expected
15740,5,"i couldnt be any more pleased with this small rice cooker from moosumive always struggled making rice because ive had to babysit it and i either add too much water or not enough meaning sticky rice or hard ricethis little device takes the hassle out of the equation and makes up to  cups of cooked rice to perfection all at a fair price for one of theseperfect for meal prepperfect rice"
6974,1,i bought this camera right before new years it was great for maybe three pictures until the flash never turned off even when the camera setting was on no flash it flashed during the picture some pictures came out with people all white looking like an ethereal being with a bright light for a face the camera quality was otherwise alright and took pictures like a polaroid camera should but when the flash doesnt turn off at all it ruins the camera experienceflash doesnt turn off
14355,5,this cooker is very very simple to use at least for rice ive used it a half dozen times now for rice only and love it we cook a lot of asian and i cant tell you how many times the main course has been completely cooked and we find out our rice turned out like crap those days are over perfect rice every timeim an appliance idiot and have no trouble with this thing
5721,2,the package was dented smashed and looked old i was looking for film for my granddaughters mini polaroid and the description as photo paper is unclear and misleading perhaps it is paper you put in the printer so although this comes up when i search for the film im not sure if i even have the right item and it does not give a good impression as a giftnot even sure its actually film since it is identified as paper
108,1,i have a lot of complaints with this camera i bought this camera as a gift because it was described as good for seniors it is not the buttons are small hard to operate and the menus are difficult for a senior to read despite having an lcd screen there appears to be no way to view the pictures you have already taken from the camera itself you have to connect to a computernext but far from least this camera has no focus it has a fixed focal point you have to physically move close or further away from your target to focus any potential pictureslast it generally feels really cheap the camera was inexpensive so if that was the only problem it would be forgivable you get what you pay for but in this case i think you get far less than you pay for you could probably buy a  dollar flip phone that would be a better digital camera than this junker and it would also be a phonehas no focus
10180,5,i bought this product about two month ago and since that time i cant cook rice manually anymore lol this product is super handy and easy to use that will replace all you did for cooking rice previously with just pressing turn on and cook buttonsvery convenient
3640,1,my girlfriend was super excited to get this as a bday gift but a day after using it the front button fell off it worked without the button for a bit but then only a month after using it  it stopped working we had it in its case the whole time and she is very careful with things so this is both surprising and disappointingstopped taking pictures within a month
199,1,i dont like it it doesnt come with the whole packagenot come with the batteries i had to order separately the battery
4452,2,we ordered this for our parentsit was a gift for mothersfathers day we purchased it early in the year jan we tried to set it up for the first time in august after they moved it does not work i want to return it and purchase a new one as i know they do work  my inlaws have oneneed to return this one is broken
2472,1,this camera would not focus i got my money back right away from amazoncamera only took blurry pictures
14342,5, my old rice cooker broke so i decided to buy this one this is overall a good rice cooker its a little bit on the large side but it is a nice looking device i like the rice bowl has a nice gold color to it and the cooking surface is very slickthe rice cooker itself is extremely easy to operate you basically push the menu button to select the type of rice and then push enter the quick setting takes  minutes to cook rice the rice came out fine i have not tried cooking porridge yet i will say i can recommendsolid rice cooker
12193,5,great rice cooker easy to clean and use we use it to cook white rice and sometimes brown rice what i like about this rice cooker is that we can have rice in it for  days without worrying its going to get spoiled you just have to scoop up the top layer because we leave it on and makes the top layer hard i would say it is better than tiger brand where it moist up too much and spoil the rice quickly if you want your rice to last buy this product you wont regret ita must have rice cooker
9634,4,very easy to use and clean my only complaint is that the lid it comes with has a steam hole which occasionally boiling water foam spews out of in bigger batchesgreat rice maker
13541,4,"this rice cooker works very well minimal browning on bottom of rice even if left on warm settingand with some rices  grains it will splatter easy to prevent by adding a knobsmall chunk of butter at the beginning of cookingbut the interior coating is already beginning to scratch and we only use woodbamboo utensils in it very disappointing and also concerned whether a flake will end up in the food or some metal contamination since the coating doesnt block the underlying aluminumi wish i could get a rice cooker that had a longer lasting pan so i dont have to keep replacing them and one with nontoxic materialsworks very well but inner surface is already scratched after only moderate use"
11608,4,easy to clean and use  would have loved the option to remove the cable so wont be hanged around and perhaps some space for an utensil when you are using itdoes the job
7062,2,the pictures come out terrible it makes it look like you have dark rings around your eyes whether youre close up or far away you can print pictures from your phone which is really cool but pointless since they come out horriblyterrible picture quality
15855,5, i love this rice maker its my first one and its soooo easy to use all i did was add  cups of rinsed rice jasmine and  cups of water turned to on and that was it about  minutes later i had a full pot of fluffy rice it was perfect and delicious because the pot is nonstick the rice just fell out leaving an almost spotless pan the cleanup was super easy this will certainly be my new go to rice makereasy
10979,5,who knew making rice could be so easy i always hated making rice because you had to babysit it on the stove top but not now prep it hit the button and walk awaywish i had bought one of these years ago
3797,1,any sd card that was used said unreadablethey worked in other cameras we haddidnt work
12466,5,i was worried that  was a little too small but it made enough for the two of us you really need to super rinse the rice because the overflow of foam if you dont rinse would probably kill this cooker in a hurry great pricejust enough for  adults
3977,1,lights are blinking but it wont take pictures anymore very disappointed used it maybe twicebroke after one use total waste of money
7064,1,terrible to spend the money on this camera only to use it once and then not be able to contact customer service for a software issue within the system the camera does not recognize the zinc paper i hope this is an isolated issue to my camera but very disappointed in the lack of customer servicezink paper customer service
10618,5,this product is what my wife and i where looking for no leftovers and no further hunger  great sized portions we make rice and quinoa there and it works perfectly its really tiny and cute the price is unbeatable and its really fast comes with a plastic spoon and the teflon works really well all our friends want one now best part it saves soooo much spaceworks perfectly
11588,4, i hope work goodneeds be more careful
11459,5,love the color this works great for one person or a small meal for  peoplethis works great for one person
10391,5,convenient reliable and hassle free it cooks and steams wellgreat to have
15370,4, my family and i eat white rice religiously so finding a good rice cooker was vital i just received it today and i was disappointed because it did not come with the rice and soup paddles like it says on the description it also took approximately  mins to cook  cups of rice lastly it is bigger and bulkier than expected which i was hoping for something more compact the good news is that my rice turned out good with no soggy sides and the rice cooker itself is pleasing to the eye but would not purchase again if it breaks hope this helpsattention rice lovers
10338,4,"needed a new rice cooker and decided to go with one that has a few other functions  have only used it for rice  it is easy to useworks great rice comes out perfectonly giving  starts since you cannot remove lid for a cleaning so i just wipe down the inside and outside of the lid to remove the water stains from steaming love everything elsecant wait to try and make oatmeal in itgreat little rice maker"
9673,4,"i had purchased this rice cooker when it was about  dollars and it arrived quickly and intact some people mention cracked lids but i think thats more the shipping company and ive used it about  times so fari only have  complaints the cooker runs a tad hot and the pot feels a bit thinnow by this i mean it has a simple cooking mechanism you plug in it goes to warm to turn off you unplug it and to actually cook the rice you click the cook button which will automatically shut off and turn to warm when the pot is finished though for me the bottom of the rice browns a little lightly not burning but try not to leave it too longas for the thin pot part it works well its nonstick and works well but my advice is use the plastic spatula on it and no metal utensils to scratch the surface and no scouring brushes when washing just a standard sponge works and dont be too rough to warp or bend it and youll be fineyou cant really be too picky for the price though its much much cheaper than most options and it works adequate for standard use especially if you are a college student or just a broke guy living by himself it works you can turn it on and just forget about it cook up some rice fry an egg on top some sriracha and mayo kewpie if youre being extra and go on takes maybe  minutes give or take for a cup of rice and you can fry up any leftovers the next daygreat for the cost"
9324,4,nice rice cooker gave one star less than  because mine is silver and has a big dent on the side but it still works and is a good accessory for anyones kitchenmoosum electric rice cooker
15383,5,i want another oneamazing
4941,1,i hoped for fully functional camera but when it arrived battery was bad and out of power after only couple of minutes of use even if had been fully charged over night not very good warranty process and not being able to get new battery is complete waste of time and money 
13604,5,"browsing on amazon i realized ive had this rice cooker for  years so i thought it deserved a review i use it an average of once or twice a week and have only used it to cook brown and white riceit does spurt and sputter especially if you are making brown rice probably due to additional stuff in the brown rice causing foamier bubbles in addition to needing more water for brown rice as long as the lid is seated properly not floating on water or a stray rice grain and you cover it with a towel flour sack towel works great when its cooking its fine but i am not a countertop neatnik i definitely make sure the lid is seated properly and cover it with a tea towel or kitchen towel i almost never presoak my rice even brown rice if you want a spurtfree rice cooker you need one of those with the hinged latching lids they have special gaskets and systems to manage the bubbling and overflow the benefit of this simpler style is that its less bulky and easy to clean with warm water and a dish brushas for complaints about cooking quality you really need to use water ratios from your rice packaging not the generic ones that come with the rice cooker for japanesestyle short or medium grain white or haiga partially milled rice nishiki botan calrose for example i would use  cup rinsed rice   cup water this is the  oz cup that comes with the cooker i also use a japanese kagayaki medium grain brown rice that does exceptionally well with just  cup rinsed rice   cups water and cooks up fine with no presoaking i find brown rices to be more variable in their water needs unfortunately so ymmvi dont like constantly plugging  unplugging things so i use a simple plugin switch at the wall to shut it off i found one at my local hardware store years ago its similar to this  ge grounded onoff power switch plugin white energy efficient space saving design ul listed     the biggest negative for the  model the middle size i think it holds  cups uncooked max is that the bottom does seem too hot making just  cup uncooked rice tends to result in rice thats dry and crunchy on the bottom my typical batch is  cups raw rice at a time and i find  cup batches work well the bottom can get slightly brown but if you turn it off within  minutes or so it doesnt dry out too much however its definitely annoying and is the one problem that has made me want to ever investigate a different rice cooker everhowever since this has proven to be a workhorse and reliably produces delicious rice for my purposes im still giving it  starssimple  effective"
7540,1,i wanted a cheap alternative to a gopro i have a couple gopros already so im used to the quality of the models and what to expect i thought i would try a cheap camera as a way to subsidize the costs of my racing program and wanted to see if i could get gp quality with a cheaper device unfortunately that answer is no a camera in  is the quality of gopro  maybe a  but id rather have a fleet of gopro hero  before i would consider ever using this the  looks like hot trash and the user interface although simple is simple minded this is not a go pro killer like some people are claiming it simply a cheap camera you can take if you do not want to spend the money on a gopro to be honest i would save your money and put it towards a used or refurbished gopro  youll spend the same amount and be a lot happier once again i was hoping to be wrong but the moment i took it out of the box and it booted it up it was already pretty clear these positive reviews are probably being given by people who have not experienced a high quality action cam on the level that gopro provides i hate sounding like a fanboy but its just facts if gopro is an iphone xs this camera is a cheap metro pcs android devicedont believe the hype
1422,2,the camera is not what i expectedcamera not worth it
117,1,i bought this for my daughters birthday when it arrived it did not have the sd card i went out and got one the picture says it all it will not read the brand new sdcard i tried to format turned the camera off and on multiple times and scrolled through the menu looking for anyway to fix thisthis is a junk buysd card was not with the product
9703,5,this thing is ridiculous the quick rice option works so well that i wonder why theres a regular option sadly i havent done the boiled eggs thing yet but my oh my the cake function my friends never imagined such a thing to be possible it makes flawless cakes and the best part practically no cleanup afterwards just a little rinse and sponge this is my third aroma rice cooker and this is the best of the three very very highly recommendedbest of the best
10536,5,i purchase this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it it works perfectly after over two yearsworks great
16552,2,"wow this rice cooker size isnt even worth wasting your time also the description says it comes with steamer basket but mine did noti have used this brand of rice cooker but recommend getting the next size up from this oneway too small no steaming basket came"
11013,4,"its a rice cooker it makes rice just fine just plug it in put in the bowl filled with a  ratio of washed rice and water flick the switch and itll beep when its done i only tried it with jasmine rice and not brown rice thoughafter its done itll keep the rice warm indefinitely but in order for you to turn it off youll have to unplug it which is the only reason why i took a star off its a bit inconvenientthe size makes it good for dorms and people who only need rice for  people to be honest id rather buy a version with an onoff switch for a few dollars more than thisit does what you bought it for but theres no off switch"
16663,5,the instructions arent written very well for when im trying to cook different types of rices it looks like there are more options than what the instructions cover but overall i love this rice cooker it keeps the rice so warm and fresh for so long the pot is so heavy duty so i feel like this will last me longer than most rice cookers ever havei only have one small complaint
17014,5,exellent product love it i used it a lot i will buy it againoutstanding
263,2,really   video  well if you go that route expect to change your desktops laptopsto the newest and fastest or else youre doomed oh not to mention memoryi recorded a school play that was  hours at best i was able to conned the clips with powerdirector  but not edit du to jitter it took  hours to process the resulting file was  gigabytes so you put up with a bulky camera that still lost focus due to stage lights for the  promise only to realize the silliness of chasing megapixels and  resolution at the price of all this impracticality so if you have nothing better to do go for it your call give me a break

1204,1,this camera is not functional it takes terrible grainy photos too many steps to see or delete a photo it requires windows  to upload photos which it doesnt specify i would buy a disposable old school camera before i use this oneworst camera

916,1,i bought this camera because it was less expensive i tried to use it as a zoom camera when i hooked up the camera to the monitor there was no way to remove the icons on my monitor i had to zoom in to hide icons and it gave me a horrible video on screenicons cannot be removed
14383,5,the rice cooker has been life changing awesome by far my favorite appliance in my entire kitchen seriously it is so easy to use and it cooks my steel cut oats to perfection every single time it even allows me to set a timer and overnight cooks the oats and they are ready at my prechosen time i use this every single day  its super easy to clean too and its dummy proofthis hands down has been the best the best purchase
2762,1,this did not come with the memory card which was a huge selling point for me i am extremely disappointed with this purchaseincomplete
14320,5,ive owned  zojirushis a tiger and now a toshiba the toshiba is the best one yet i retired my most recent a zojirushi due to the deteriorating condition of the bowl which was missing a lot of chips of teflon which i assume i ate i bought the toshiba because of reviews which specifically lauded the bowl i can tell you that the bowl is  times heavier than the bowl in my zojirushi and the whole cooker reflected the same superior quality of design and construction a wholly superior product the rice incidentally is excellent and cleanup is a breeze highly recommendeddollar for dollar the best you can buy
13804,4,"the machine itself works great ive made oatmeal several times now using the timer to have it ready at  am great rice with just a single button pressthe biggest issue ive had is the manual instructions on the two timers the manual stedfastly refuses to just state what each timer actually controls what functions instead they have thistimerafter selecting the function need to preset the cooking time press the timer button  light on and the corresponding function light flashes on press the timer button again  light off and  light on set the time and press the start buttonthe preset time is the cooking completion time hr and min buttons press the hr or min button to adjust the cooking time of slow cook and porridge select the reserving set state press the hr or min button to set the time of stopping reserving press hr once to increase  press min once to increase to add to this confusion when you select a specific program it shows a default cook time setting that you can adjust at this point but if you then press the timer button timer  which im assuming is cook time appears and displays some random time why pressing the timer button again switches to timer  which is the delay timer where you set the completion time you want this can get kind of confusingworks great confusing manual"
17023,4,the rice cooker is very cute but when the rice is cooked open the lid there is no place to collect the excess water unfortunately it makes the rice on the surface a bitopen the lid
336,2,photos details on photo bird nest zoomed all the way out then all the way in random snapshot in the yardthe zoom on this is incredible and the is works great  and you need is when zoomed in the combo of full auto and is makes for some amazing zooms i have a  mm lens on my canon camera and it does not come close to this zoom levelphoto quality is decent photos are  meg each as a comparison the ones from my canon are  meg so youre not getting the same quality  but this camera is literally  of the price of the canon in all honesty im carrying this around with me  the big prolevel camera is just too big for daily carry plus if i go to a sports game concert etc this camera usually gets past the door the big one never doestimelapse saves a bunch of individual photos not a video filedownsides its all plastic its not a touchscreen battery life is mediocre it lasted about  photos one reason is that theres no viewfinder  the rear screen is always on so for a timelapse for example it lasts just over two hours and  photos that screen takes a lot of poweronly one battery is included no cf card and no charger the battery needs to charge in the camera a microsd cable is includedfor under  the camera is an amazing deal but one caveat  i had a lot of problems with it getting focus it would focus then lose focus constantly to the point where it was often impossible to get a photoincredible bang for the buck full remote control with app but it cant focus well
7922,1,incredibly disappointed not sure what i expected waste of time purchasing this now at least i get to return it i tried changing the settings again not sure what i expected to happen very poor quality picture i would never purchase this if i had seen an example of the picture qualityhorrible quality
15641,5,when used as directed this moosum cooker makes rice that is indistinguishable from what youd get in an asian restaurant its easy to use easy to clean and doesnt take up much space a large family might want a bigger one this one makes up to  cups but the moosum is just right for my needs my only complaint is that the power cable is quite short but its a standard cable and can easily be replaced this is a very nice itemdefinitely check it out if youre a big rice eateri couldnt be happier

14344,5,"this is my first rice cooker and i absolutely love it i looked around before purchasing and i think i chose wisely it was  off when we bought it so i was very pleasedi have to mention there was a mark on the  one i received and it bothered because it was on the front for that kind of money i expected it to look perfect i wrote customer service and received a new one the following day i couldnt believe itwe have used it almost every single day since getting it about  months ago and have absolutely no complaint also super easy to clean you will not be disappointedbest rice cooker"
8450,1,its just horribleworst purchase
11526,5,so cutepink colour is so cute
12212,5,i thought i was going to buy an inexpensive rice cooker so i started looking at reviews and discovered they didnt do a good job with brown rice i cook brown rice almost exclusively i might make white rice a few times a year if im having a guest who wants it but thats it my impediment to making brown rice weekly was that i burn the bottom and have water on the top even cooking it exactly for the time on the particular brands packing using the exact amount of water and good cookware i am a decent cook otherwise so this was baffling to me and it seemed like it was time for this investment i researched best brown rice cookers on external websites and the reviews here seemed like this particular one was a good choice it makes perfect brown rice im making brown rice at least twice a week which leads to eating more vegetables and less processed food too ive used it for white rice just once and that came out perfectly too i have not used it to bake a cake and doubt that i will im also good with continuing to make my oatmeal on the stovetop as my minute quick oats are faster than they would be in the rice cooker but i like that i could do so many things there are two drawbacks to this rice cooker but they are not enough to take away a star  the measuring cup is not a cup so i have to use their plastic one and if i were to lose it i would not be sure exactly how much rice to use im not sure if its a metric measure since the markings for a cup of rice inside the rice cooker are in imperial units as far as i can tell even though the box and instructions came in multiple languages  the tray for steaming vegetables is plastic and is not even marked as bpafree plastic i wont cook in plastic im not stressed about a tiny cup to measure out my rice before washing it and putting it in the cooker though i intentionally chose one with a stainless steel bowl as the being in a cold cup for a few seconds wont do anything but i dont want food cooking in hot plastic i cant seem to buy a stainless steel steamer basket either as is possible for some brands so i steam my vegetables in a silicone steamer basket in a regular pot this is pretty minor though the plastic scoop tool meant not to scratch the bowl is also plastic but this is absolutely no big deal as i imagine anyone who eats a lot of rice has a wooden rice spoon anyway and anyone who cooks probably has some other bamboo or silicone kitchen tools anyway this is probably my best purchase ever on amazon and well worth the costim eating better thanks to this rice cooker
16809,5,i used long grain white rice and did not use the quick function white rice came out perfectly and i am very satisfied with this productamazing rice cooker
10746,5,this has to be the least expensive non stick cook ware ever available on amazon i am one of those males who has a hard time doing anything for himself and i usually just go to the store and buy beef jerky and consider that a meal alongside my coffee but this rice cooker has changed my life i think its been two weeks and ive done nothing but make rice it even has a marker on it that lets you know if youre about to screw up your rice or not because it does everything for you after you fill the water to the line i was scared at first because the instruction manual is as thick as a novel but sadly it is the same directions repeated  times in  languages for what i assume is the purpose to prevent idiots from melting the plastic dish that comes with the cooker it doesnt actually tell you what the dish is for it just says to remove it before you heat anything it cant be used a strainer because the holes are too big and you cant put dry rice on it because itll stick to the plastic theres a really wide spoon it comes with too and im just guessing thats for shoveling it into my mouth which ive been doing regularly it works like a toaster so you cant screw it up even if you tried and you can even leave it on for six days or until your roommates discover youve left it on again while you were asleep dont touch the little metal ring on the inside while its plugged in the instruction manual actually says not to do this but i tried it anyway and now and missing a layer skin on the index finger of my right hand so youve been warnedperfect for morons who cant cook two ingredients like me
7759,2,just so so cannot get wrist band on cameraok
13216,4,this rice cooker is fine the only problem is that the steam reservoir pops off every once in a while i empty it every time but when its midway of cooking the reservoir pops off makes a little water mess on the floor not funsteam reservoir
3866,2,i received a broken camera and learned of this a week into my vacation beware of cameras being sold at a discount the camera itself is just ok i did not find it to be as great as everyone is saying maybe it is me but i found i had to fiddle with the camera too much to get a good pic while someone next to me with an iphone or samsung phone got a quick snapshot that was fabulous i am used to the dslr not averse to change but ultimately unimpressed with the mirrorless technologycamera just ok was defective
9424,5,it works very good perfect rice and veggies every timeworks good
6427,1,the first one i got would not keep a charge at all couldnt record barely a minute video and it would die on me i put in a claim and they gave me another one so then i get that one and it wont take more than a  minute video without it dying on me theyre just garbage need better batteriesits garbage
3021,1,the first time i purchased it it didnt work so i asked for a replacement and i just got it today but it also doesnt workwaste
143,2,i was hoping for quality pictures for my daughters scrap book i wld really like to return this device the problem was the button to press to take the picture is not in a good location and film is wasted bc a persons thumb or finger or the strap is in the way and now you have taken and wasted a picture the concept was a good one but the device is not customer friendly at all buyer bewaredisappointed
6167,2,picture quality was not good at all it was very blurry sent mine back waiting on my refunddont do it
15764,5,works great and easy to use even came with a few recipes very happy with iteasy to use
16624,4,i havent used it much but i hoped it was equipped to do multiple things besides cooking rice i wished i could also steam vegetables at the same time not possiblerice cooker
9376,5,i love my rice cooker and all that it does besides rice if it had  s i would give it  aloha dolly hernandezabout a great product
17659,4,"nice retractable cordtakes a little longer than our old zojirushismaller than the old one easier to storenew  cup zojirushi"
5998,1,dont waste your money on this camera battery life is crap quality crap all around crap over priced as wellwaste
12008,5,"i waited a few months to make sure this was a fair review as i hate the uselessrevirws of just got it and its great nonsenseive done everything short of making a cake and its used  times a week with a rare occasion of more than once a day and yes it has a setting for cake lolcleaning disassembly is wonderful the upper plate even has a nice pull tab to make this even easier however it may not work as well for those with massive handsrice washed every time and made short grain sushi rice longer white grain basmati and jasmine and cheap as can be brown rice all cooked very wellveggies buns and dumplings all steamed without a single hitch as well even when rice was cooked belowonly tested up to  cups of white rice while also steamingthe retractable cord is great for removing additional clutter and the built in battery means you can store it away and not have to deal with resetting the timeoverall absolutely solid and worth the price as long as you dont need to pressure cook which is the next model up from hereabsolutely solid buy"
3634,1,this is an amazing camera but it takes two photos when i put a new pack of film in and then refuses to take the other  photos its frustrating because i already sent the other camera back that had the same exact problem at this point i need to be refunded and given a camera that actually works please i paid good money for this and its disappointing  i want it to work so badly when it does work it takes amazing photosgreat photos but only takes  or  photos out of  in each film pack
9224,1,doesnt work i turn it on and it stays on the welcomescreen and does nothing elsedont work
13088,5,cosori an appliance name i have come to trust with many different appliances readout is very clear and the instructions are easy to read and understand my big test will come when i try it out with black rice and next week with oatmeal more tests to come but so far a must have for the kitchen from a name you can rely onrice cooker
13939,4,"great for brown rice white rice is a little gummy whatever you cook best to open the lid asap when its done cooking i actually take the pan out and let it rest on the stove nice appliance i would recommendtip carefully midway through the cooking cycle give it a stir to distribute the wateris great for brown rice"
13030,5,it is easy to install and easy to use nice rice cookerworks
656,1,so disclaimer let me put this first i was shopping for a similar camera i had one in my cart in fact and then amazon came along and said lightning deal order within the next ten minutes and save x and i thought well hey it looks like a decent offer and kinda did that in the requisite time limit without being able to spend the requisite time to actually learn what i was buying shame on amazon it does lower my overall rating to a  it might otherwise be a  if i wasnt bamboozled but on to the productthis is deceptive looking its got a display and what looks like a nice lens but on close inspection youll find it is literally more smoke than mirrorsthe picture quality is about par to a digital camera of late  century grainy even in almost ideal lighting videos are miserable my particular camera didnt record any audio for any of the videos i took the sd card it came with is not like the one in the photo it is a micro card in an adapter and i got card errors from the camera itself i used another card i had to test how good it was and it just isnt dont botherjunk your phone does much better
14141,5,so far so good i have been using it about five days does not have any problems it is enough for  people small familywould recommend itworking good

10591,5,it works very well this is very very small rice cooker but it makes enough rice for one personsuper cute very small
5224,1,came to me like it was used before screen scratched camera doesnt hold charge for longkids camera sent to me like it was used before
1840,2,the camera is functional but it arrived with almost dead batteries that didnt trigger the low battery light and the only way i figured that out was when i found a guy on youtube describing the same problem i use this camera for my business and this problem caused unnecessary headachesdoesnt work right out of the box
2539,2,after only a week of occasional use it wont hold a charge and stopped working my  year old is devastatedcute camera and great concept but im so sad we paid almost  just for it to not work not working after a week
3796,1,this is the worst camera it should be  not  its extremely low quality and you have to hold the camera very still and even then your photos come out blurryi regret this purchasedo not buy
8940,1,bought this product and it didnt work very disappointed still waiting for my refund i spend a lot of money on amazon and this is very unacceptablecamera
11385,5,its super simple and easy to use but it only cooks about two cups of rice at a time its about half the size of a normal family rice cooker but that could be a good thing for people living on thier own or in dormseasy to use only for singles or couples
5102,1,play video i purchased the productim charging it to use it now but the red light flickers and it doesnt seem to chargei tried charging it for four hoursmaybe its not chargingthe power wont turn on
12586,5,totally loved it it takes very less time and cooks the rice properly no mess and easy to clean as wellmust in the kitchen
8522,1,i had the camera for exactly one week worked great and took lots of cute shots on day  i tried to turn it on and received the dreaded e error message blinking where the film count usually is i tried all of the recommended fixes holding down the power switch putting in a new film pack another waste of a pack charging the battery to full and looking inside for blocked film nothing worked and the lens would not openill be shipping the camera back to fujifilm on my dime unfortunately to see if it if fixable or if they will send a replacement i will update the review thenreceived e error message after  week
3365,1,disappointedtried to charge n use on vacation didnt keep chargeno charge not satisfied
11059,4,this is good but it needs the top piece on all the time for it to actually work otherwise you get the issue of it spurting out water every now and again ive havent had problems and the steaming works great it does burn rice every now and againits good but
4013,2,item arrived in an open box not sure it was in new conditionopen box
4097,2,in total ive invested about  in my  camera arlo setup including additional camera mounts ive owned the system since june of  so i have a fairly good assessment of them at this point the bottom line arlo is fundamentally flawed in that its ability to live stream and record video are marred by significant latency that causes the cameras to miss critical recording momentscheck on your cameras live stream forget about it live streaming is painfully slow to connect often times i am watching a spinning wheel on the video feed up to a couple minutes long and when it finally decides to stream theres constant waiting as the camera tries to maintain its connection as you can imagine this makes live monitoring of any of the cameras pretty much uselessrecording motion your mileage may vary but it misses too much of the action for me my scenario one of the five cameras is positioned above my driveway a pretty standard installation if you ask me see photo by the time i park my car in the driveway get out of the car and into the house walking across the driveway to the right arlo misses everything all i have is a recording of my parked car the same goes for the reverse when i walk across the driveway from right to left get in the car and drive off arlo has recorded an empty driveway some call this aftermath recording i would agreeim pretty much giving up on this system and will be selling it off when your security camera is unable to capture critical events or unable to serve a consistent connection you might as well have no camera security at allfor what its worth i also own two samsung security cameras samsung smartcam hd pro  and samsung smartcam hd  fullhd although i have many issues with the samsung cameras you can read my review of the samsung smartcam hd pro  here  the one thing they are quite good at is recording on a moments noticelatency issues with live stream and motion detection render this smart security system all but useless
13114,2,i already have a newer version of this rice cooker but its worn out for so much use i saw that this was  and its the same brand i was ecstatic my rice cooker was  i used this product and water spewed from the vent everywhere i followed directions like always do somehow this was defective there was a pool of water by the vent and diwn the sides if the rice cooker and underneath and all over the counter that spilt onto the floor im glad i didnt throw or give the old one away i had to revert back to using it it maybe worn out but its still in great condition it doesnt spew water from the vent be careful with your purchasenot a happy ice cooker
686,2,i havent had a chance to download the photos yet researching what i need to do as msdc does not pop up when i connect but other than that the camera seems to be working well so far no other issues will update review once i can figure this outgood so far
4570,2,disappointing i ordered the camera for instant printing for my daughter and it looks beautiful and unique but it does not print a photo of the quality shown in the picture i tried several times and you can barely see somethingpoor quality printing
7231,1,returned it i walk with a cane in my right hand so that would not work 
7324,2,i was hoping to be able to have some sort of focus option and be able to zoom there arent many times this camera will be very usefulnot really practical
3929,2,i was so excited to get this camera but  out  only come out proper the other  are black doesnt matter what i try finger on the picture take button a long time short time  to  or even  to  ratio very upsettingwhas wanting this camera for so long didnt work iut as planned
10022,5,bought it for my husband so he could easily make rice its very easy to use and super easy to cleaneasy to use
13398,5,cooks rice perfect everytime the steamer tray is actually large enough to steam veggies for four for dinnergreat
12206,5,used this every day to make rice i cook brown and white rice and its to perfection the timer is the coolest feature wash the rice and its ready when i get home can make other recipes too havent tried all the features but i would buy it again one down side it kind of small but for a family of  its perfectmust buy for rice lovers
8527,1,i just hung up with fujifilm customer service and they are aware that their instax cameras fail on a massive scale but are unwilling to do anything about iti bought this camera a few years ago which i loved while it worked it recently stopped recognizing new film cartridges when they are loaded i bought a regular instax mini for my goddaughter and same story her moms instax mini has the same unexplained failure thats  is clearly a bad faith businessbuyer beware instax cameras fail get a different brand camera
16581,2,bought this in november  loved it until i didnt it started switching to warm instead of cook for the rice tonight we finally had  hours later because it kept thinking it needed to be warm when everything was raw went to their site and it was not our outlets tried  they said hit the reset button there wasnt one disappointedworked greatfor a while 
2523,1,i dont know how anyone can get good movie quality out of this gopros have horrible video quality i went on youtube and followed everyones advice on settings the low light is sooo bad this us the gopro  wtf supposedly this is a pretty awesome little video camera unless your in the mountains snowboarding or in paradise on some sunny beaches i really cant seem to find a good use for this i cant get over how bad the video quality of this camera ismmmmhmmm
1619,1,i really liked that this was a lightweight and supposedly easy camera to use i suppose it wouldve been very easy to use had it worked properly i am in the process of requesting a refunddoesnt work properly
13431,5,ive tried different rice cookers but this one is the better of the bunch it is fast reliable and welldesigned it quickly cooked my japanese short grained rice and it came out fluffy and delicious would highly recommendworks great
6092,1,put new batteries in it went to take a picture and a red light kept flashing super bummeddidnt work 
13779,5,make sure you get your cup to water ratio right i love the steamed rice optionget your measurements right
1885,1,i bought this for my sons wedding and half the film is missing from the package i could send it back and reorder but now the price has increased i am so  sheets of film missing
16516,2,i have had this cooker for only  months i use it about once a week i noticed that the rice is not cooking all the way through in some sections the bottom is cooked and the top is not i am so annoyed i follow the instructions exactly  cups of rice using the cup that come with the cooker and putting water up to the  mark i am really reconsidering buying appliances on amazon not enough time to return or exchanged products that are not working as it shouldregrets
13858,5,i bought this because i dislike cooking good cook no patience it is computerized and does everything with beepers to let you know when the food is ready the rice came out perfectly and separatecompact computerized and easy to use
6309,1,i bought this for my daughter in december and had been working perfectly up until it died i purchased the twoyear insurance plan to cover this camera incase anything happened well now the camera is not working and i cannot contact anybody from manufacturer theres not even a website for them what was the purpose of purchasing the twoyear plan if it does mess up and now i cant even return itnot happyno contact information for this manufacturer
935,1,microphone did not work well at all video was grainy too not worth the money when my phone takes much better videonot worth it
1692,1,this is the strongest resolution i could get on any photo there is even a section in the manual called wont focus do not spend your money on this defectimages will not focus  look like polaroids
3648,1,the camera is simple and basic but the photos are terrible every photo is overexposed and flash cannot be adjusted even tried the tip to cover the flash with a bandaid and the pictures still dont turn outhorrible picture quality every photo is overexposed
899,1,update seller contacted me about my onestar review and their attitude was very much an oh well sucks to be you kind of thingthey do not stand behind their productwhen recording videos it will only record a  minute and  second segment and then starts a new file all on its own i recorded a  hour interview and instead of having one two hour video i have ten  minute videos now i dont even know what im going to do since the interview cannot be redone this was the only reason i bought the camera and it failed miserably also the batteries drain really quickly i wish i hadnt bought this cameradont waste your money
5280,2,the battery didnt work even after i charges it i havent had the time to go get another battery so ive been unable to use itif i get another battery and it still doesnt work im sending it backthe battery didnt work even after i charges it 
5554,1,will not focus on closeups very disappointedwill not focus on closeups
16979,5,"perfect rice cooker and so much morelooks neat and cleans easilyso easy to use and easy to clean"
189,1,this is the second rebel  i have bought in the last  or  weeks the first one had a messed up sensor on it i sent it back to canon for repair it came back worse than when i sent it they wanted me to send it to them again ha but i had a ton of lenses for a canon i cannot afford to replace so i am stuck with onethis second one has what appears to be oil spots on the photos i am returning it and lenses or no i am going to purchase a nikonspots
12058,4,very good rice cooker it does what it suppose to but its a little pricey plays a little jingle when it finish cooking your ricevery good
7004,1,biggest pile of junk i have ever bought never buy this if you want better pictures draw them they would by far be better then this camera can producebiggest pile of junk
13100,4,easy to use put the stuff in and turn on and forgetrice cooker
11048,5,ive only used it  times and have only cooked brown rice in it but each time was great since im only cooking for one the small size is perfect so i can keep it out on the counter since i will be using it a few times a week the first time i used it i just put in  cups of water and one cup of rice it made a mess spewing water out the valve and around the lid the next two times i soaked the rice for about  minutes and then rinsed it well through a mesh strainer before cooking the result was perfect rice with no mess in the past no matter how i cooked brown rice on the stove it would either come out undercooked or mushy this rice came out perfectly cooked and even a bit chewy which i really like my only complaint is that the chord comes out the side of the cooker instead of out the back its a weird awkward place which makes it hard to keep the cooker facing front so i can see when it is finished cookingworks great
12294,5,"super simple to use first time using it made jasmine rice settings were simple and took  minutes for perfect fluffy sticky rice that was nice and moistfor sure a game changer im a rice boi nowthis rice is bussin"
307,1,had to return product missing parts and severely scratchedscuffednot what i expected
10604,5,perfect little rice cooker for two of us and our small pup follow the ratio and use the cup that comes with it and youll get perfect rice every time our bigger rice cooker was always too much rice that we ended up throwing out leftovers this provides the perfect amount for dinner love itperfect for us
13081,5,this is an excellent rice cooker with eighteen functions very versatile makes up to ten cups enough for the entire familyexcellent rice cooker
5530,1,superior camera for the price though you should be aware that the viewfinder provides a picture which looks like youre in a movie theatre looking at a screen far away its doable and while you may think its a defect panasonic says it isnt my problem with the camera is not the camera which is outstanding but amazon sending me a second chance box without a discount and more importantly without asking if im willing to accept someone elses return a used camera which no doubt has not been examined for whatever problems caused it to be returned really crappy customer service but thats becoming the norm for amazon latelyis this a joke amazon
9945,5,i actually bought this as gift for my grandson and his family i having been using an earlier version of this aroma rice cooker for over  years and wont part with it toworth every dollar
6350,1,frozen and cannot be used and has only been owned for  months avoid 
3858,1,play video this camera does not do  recording at all both   and  options produce video that looks like this when imported to a computerfalse advertising buyer beware
6780,2,not everything that was supposed to be included was the camera bag memory card holder and sun shield were not in the package would have returned it but it was a gift disappointing to have an incomplete gift and didnt fell right to take back a giftmissing items
5392,2,i bought the kodak pixpro friendly zoom   digital camera because i dont like using my phone to take photos and videos i wanted a halfway decent cheap camera to keep around in a pocket my expectations were pretty low at this price point a point and shoot with optical zoom still has its place even though we have much nicer  cameras available unfortunately this one has  major shortcomings aside from these  issues i like the camera size the gui and the optionsfeatures for the  digital image stabilization does not do squat the videos are super shakyjittery like old home movies from the  and the photos are blurredout of focus more than half the time even in direct sunlight on auto mode it is a gamble so i have to take  shots to get a clean one its very difficult to get decent shots in low light  still shoots video in antique mov format instead of  so you have to install deprecated versions of quiktime or some  party app to even play it on a windows or linux machine it is just ridiculous to sell a new camera in  using a proprietary video format that has not been supported for almost  now maybe a firmware update will improve things i ended up returning it and spending  as much for a better camera with optical stabilization and i made sure it shoots in  a cheap phone camera
8847,1,the only thing going for this camera is the zoom and the quality isnt that good i literally pulled out my iphone and took better photos its disrespectful to release a camera product like this in  at any price upgrade the cameras to  this camera should be better than a phone appbetter off buying a smartphone using and its camera
6209,1,my main complaint is that its incredibly bulky and its basically impossible to keep the cover fixed around my  lens  it keeps popping forward and ending up in my pictures the material is very thick so it doesnt compress well  it likes to keep its shape its easier to use with a telephoto lens since the lens shaft consumes more of the length of the cover but i dont use my telephoto that much and frankly its the electronics of the body that im concerned about protecting not the lens so if the telephoto stuck out a bit and got rained on i wouldnt be bothered in other words this cover would be much better with a shorter lens housingfyi im using a sony  which is not a huge camera but its certainly a lot bigger than say a canon rebel which is also advertised in the amazon item title this cover is already too big for my camera so i cant imagine using it with a more compact model one size definitely does not fit alltoo big too bulky slips forward wont stay in place
2736,2,will not work at allcharged it fully twice and still wont workdoes not work
30,4,for the most part it does what it is supposed to charger will charge the phone but it has to be set just perfectly on it which can be a little annoying at night but there is a redgreen light so you know when it is actually charging also i can not get rapid charging to work with this charger and my pixel  so it may not actually be a  chargerit works but no rapid charging
3741,2,i wanted a small camera i could carry easily in my purse never could get the place to format the sd card to come up on the camera when the menu items come up you couldnt tell which one you were on lid on battery area did not close well all in all it was not as good a deal as i thought pretty color but not a good buynot so good
10235,5,good price for a good productcooker
4928,1,i bought item for my trip but it only took  pictures and the memory is full not able to take anymore pictures after that am not recommending this productnot worth the money
14844,5,i purchased this rice cooker because i am moving into a new apartment and need a compact cooker this one is the perfect size for my needs and its cooks the rice exactly how i like it it is also simple to use because i just push down the switch and dont have to worry about it while i cook my other food this is a  purchase i would recommend to friends and familyperfect size rice cooker
11849,4,my son is  and likes to keep his meals simple and doable because its just him he eats a lot of rice and chicken after hearing a friend of mine talk about her rice cooker and how amazing and easy it was i decided that my son would probably want one to make his food prep simpler when i researched this i decided i would buy one for him and one for me i am so glad i did i used it for the first time and it was so awesome and easy with perfect rice that i immediately made another batch so that i could have some to make fried rice the following night i then texted my son who had been using his for a couple of weeks already and he said that rice cooker is badass mom i give it four stars because i had to research youtube videos on how to use it since the manual that comes with it has no information my advice to the manufacturers is to give people some guidelines on how to use all of the features i prefer all of my information in one spot the paperwork that comes with it they could also put in a few recipes to get people startedbest rice ever
8690,1,goes through batteries like water picture quality only fair hard to navigate controls you have to buy a special additional sim card so youre not saving any money buying this cheap unitpoor
4633,1,does not work on cell phoneswrong description
2010,2,bought this for my wife for her birthday she loves it but it came almost  weeks after product is great but the shipping time is absurd even when you pay for faster shippingexpect late shipping
10790,5,cant believe i lived without one of these i mainly use it for white rice but ive made fried rice in it with all the ingredients and comes out really good i will suggest adding in a little more water for the rice unless you like it a little crispy on the bottomgreat

1820,1,i ordered it in june but started using it only last month it worked fine for a while but now theres a orange light instead of the white light it wont click even after changing the batteries and im using aa alkaline batteries which are the recommended batteries for this product there are no troubleshooting steps for it and its not worth the price didnt even last one month very disappointed with this purchasedisappointed with the purchase
16010,5,"this is a great rice cooker i had my previous bd rice cooker for over  years and even though some idiot not me damaged the nonstick coating on the bottom one time it kept cooking the rice just fine i got tired of it sticking in the places it was damaged so i got this new one it works just as perfectly as the old one perfect rise effortlessly every timenowdo not think if it says  cups you can put  cups of rice into it the cup referred to is the measuring cup that comes with the cooker and its about  of a regular cup measure it will make at the most  of these measurements in cooked riceto me it is easier to know how much water to put into the cooker rather than trying to get the water level to the right marking inside the bowl as it tells you to so i use the same formula as the old rice cooker i had two measurements of rice to three measurements of water using the included little plastic cup to measure both the rice and the water this will make enough rice for  people easily you can make half that or double that just stick with the same  to  formulanever use any metal in the bowl that is how it gets scratched only the plastic paddle that comes with it as soon as the cooker turns to warm i unplug the cooker and then wait a minute or two and scoop out the rice into another container if you leave it on warm too long it will dry out the rice this is a good cooker at a great price i expect it to last me as long as the old one dideasy simple way to cook rice perfectly every time"
3893,1,i am an insurance adjuster and the entire idea of buying this thing is so i could take quality photos for my claims this piece of absolute garbage is not only bulky but it only takes a mini sd card so i cannot extract the photos and put them on my computer i have to drive another  miles to staples to get my damn photos off of this thing unfortunately i dont have the box it came in anymore so now i am stuck with it the photo quality sucks and the instructions do not help with extracting the damn pictures plug the provided cord into the computer and nothing do not make the same mistake i did this thing is junkthis is absolutely the worst waste of money ever
7325,2,poor user interface and controls as well as limited mouting optionsb included in the cost of this overpriced item that is difficult to operate out of the boxoverpriced needs better user interface
5172,2,the screen started flickering and streaked after the second day of use tried to get a replacement but got no response its a terrible thing if a camera made for kids isnt built to be solidbad quality
475,2,i am a intermediate photographer this camera takes horrible pictures and you can only use it for a few hours because the pictures will not be good unless you have perfect lighting also no viewfinder or microphone mount though this did not effect my rating because this was already in the pictures also bad iso and focusing shutter speed can only go up to  seconds  not very slow which is a bad thing  also the zoom is not as good as expected and on the website they clearly used a different camera to take example photos my iphone  camera was batterdo not buy unless you live somewhere tropical
13130,4,works greatrice cooker
13009,5,very nice rice cooker and i havent had any issues thus far easy to use and my rice has come out perfect every time 
5424,1,only took  shots using this brand new camera memory full already 
13656,4,"this works well but you will probably have to experiment on how much water to use that is because the cooking time depends on it and the rice needs a certain amount of time to cook depending on the type white thai or brown etcif you cook your rice by boiling it now things probably wont change much except the cooker shuts off automatically which is very nice but i am used to microwave cooking and i have developed the right settings so that the water just comes to a boil but then the power is reduced to simmer the rice until done that way most of the water is absorbed by the rice and not boiled offfor example i use a  to  ratio of water to rice which works for both brown and white rice when microwaving but not here also i use a small amount of rice  ounces which also requires more water in order to get the requited time which is what you are after get it i now use   times as much water as rice for brown rice   times as much for thai rice and still  times as much for regular white enriched riceit means you will need to experiment and dont come whining here if your previous recipe in another type of cooker does not work also i dont bother to wash the rice and get a small amount of splatter it is no big deal but to prevent it from landing on the counter i have devised a simple solution wedge the plastic cup between the rim of the cooker and the top handle it works see the photoi mark it down slightly because the instructions although useful do not explain clearly enough what you have to do to get it to work for your situation good luckit works with the right amount of water"
17155,5,cooked long grain rice in under  unit is on the small side which is what i wanted rice was cooked perfect  solid amazom buyperfect
40,2,this is a great concept my daughter originally loved ithowever it does not come with a sd card you must have a sd card for a quick print or in order to use the capture button on the camera itselfi purchased a sd card once you insert it it pops right back out i have tried two sd cards both experiencing the same issuei am now out of  dollars and have a lost sd card due to it springing out of the cameraunable to contact seller for help i recommend looking at other optionsbroken
38,5,i love that this is a two pack i put one on my bedside table to charge at night and one in my laptop bag to travel with me while i am at work or on the gothere is a light on the side that is red when nothing is charging or your phone is misaligned that light turns green when your phone is set up to charge i have had other wireless charging pads and none have had that featurethe only drawback is that to get the full rapid charging experience you need the correct charging plugs for the wall i wish there was a frequently bought together option so i could buy the correct wall plug to make these really fastoverall extremely pleased
17397,5,"back storymy wife and i eat rice almost every night i have a stomach condition and ive learned that rice is very helpful and benefits my digestionwe went to japan a few weeks ago and rice was just completely ruined our  rice cooker no longer would sufficei still cant believe i dropped  on a rice cooker but honestly it really is worth it if perfect rice is important to you and you are going to use it we will actually it at least  nights a week just as we do the cheap oneok now on to the reviewthe instructions are a bit confusing to understand due to the translation i assume i did make perfect rice the first time i used it though so they arent that badso far its honestly perfect and i have no complaints its a bit more of a process but that has more to do with the type of rice and the rinsing process and not the machinethe only confusing part was their washing process so i will simplify it for youpour your measured amount of rice into the cooker potplace a separate bowl of water in the sink and run the faucet so its always fullrinsequickly dump the water in the bowl into the pot stir with your hand quickly  times and dump out the water repeat this  more timeswashthen take your hand and stir the rice drained with a little water left about  times quickly dump the water from the bowl into the pot repeat  more timesrinsequickly dump the water in the bowl into the pot stir with your hand quickly  times and dump out the water repeat this  more timesnow you are ready to fill the pot with the correct amount of water and start cooking use filtered water for best resultsworth every pennyif you eat rice a lot"
14442,4,i really enjoy having this rice cooker i received it at a discounted price for submitting my honest review after using it several times to make both brown and basmati rice i can report that it cleans up easily is simple to use and makes beautiful tender rice the only problem i found was that it doesnt ship in a box meant for shipping and upon arrival the box and the cooker were damaged since it is only cosmetic i wont worry about exchanging it but i would suggest that it gets shipped in a sturdy boxfantastic rice cooker
1040,1,the camera is horrible quality i returned it and have solid proof they received the product but amazon emailed me saying they did not receive it and charged me had to dispute it because there is no way to contact them for any customer service save yourself time from this type of company thefthorrible experience dont get this
814,1,too complicated to operateccan not operate
11105,4,aw just look at it its so tiny and cute it fits easily in my cabinet it makes rice better than i can so what can i say the only drawback is water gets under the handle on the glass lid every time i wash it every few times i take a screw driver to open it to dry it out if not for that itd be a  a sweet little cooker said in baby talk
1702,1,camera worked great for about  pictures then it wouldnt save photos and the screen would freeze on the only way to get it to shut off was to let it die completely very sad because i didnt use it until after my babies birthday but now its too late to returnhorrible quality
886,2,if you are looking for a camera that will make you look like a professional this is not it the sound is okay but not great with the directional mic the picture is good but not exceptional the camera is slow to respond to the remotecomes with two batteries but battery must be installed to charge there is no battery chargerif you are looking for a camera that is good enough to get the job done this one does the job with out any extra frillsi have change my stars and initial review of this camera after using it for awhile the audio is unpredictable and does not really work for my videos i will be searching for a different camera one that will allow me to plug in a lapel microphone as this directional microphone that came with the camera is not working for my vloggood for the price update
15402,5,"edit just used the cake feature for the first time it works beautifully mixed up a cake mix popped it in went down and set it to cake and walked away no need to heat up the oven in texas during a heat wave small blessings yallive never had an appliance specifically for rice before just bought the idiotproof parboiled type and called it good fancy types were for eating at restaurants loluncle roger showed me the error of my ways so here i am washing rice what the whole deal now i make a big batch of some jasmine or basmati or the brown type of either and portion it out for known calorie quick grabs in the fridge absolutely love this thingthe one thing i could wish for is a better instruction manual this one is pretty sparse and rather badly written ill figure things out but if theres an online group for users of these id love to know about itearns the space it uses"
14607,4,see my attached picturethis is how full the cooker is with  cups of rice it cooked those  cups amazingly but you cant get anymore in there than thatnot a  maker
9700,5,this product works perfectly cooks quickly and rice comes out perfect once the directions are followed perfect
211,1,pictures are fine but who at canon decided not to include a universal hot shoe is beyond me so you can only trigger off camera flashes using the on camera flash bone headedno universal hot shoe for flash
13236,2,this rice cooker works fine as intended and keeps rice warm after cooking the water level marker inside the removable bowl is barely visible they should be marked well for better visibilitywater level is barely visible
9631,5,i was disappointed in the small size after i received it so i looked on amazon for others and most items had a  and  cup capacity one item showed a  ton capacity  i cooked  cups of brown rice that i probably bought from the bulk section of whole foods and was pleasantly surprised i think rice is bland but the rice tasted good was fluffy and the size is perfect i ate a little over a cup of rice and put the remaining rice in the refrigerator i plugged it in without anything in the bowl and noticed a heat smell similar to turning on a stove so i think it gets hot before pressing the button the concern about the size is not an issue after using the aroma housewares aroma  one touch rice cooker i like the productgood product i recommend
16064,5,i like it cooks rice perfectly as i like it good for the valuenice brand
2698,1,my son loves the camera the only issue is that within a month of having the camera the sound just died he loves hearing music from it and its super disappointing that he no longer can do that my return window is closed so we are just stuck with this camera that has no soundgreat for  month and the sound disappeared
2049,2,i wish i could return this polaroid ive tried taking photos with flash without etc and the quality is always very poor im aware a polaroid will never produce photos like the ones you print at a print shop i know what to expect i dont recommend this productterrible print quality
4250,1,i am returning this product 
5397,1,on april   i ordered from amazon a kodak pixpro friendly zoom   mp digital camera it was sent to my daughter in connecticut i am retired and living in guatemala she was coming here for my granddaughters quinceanera on june  and brought the camera the camera is a piece of junk after about  exposures the screen went blank and camera would not work i down loaded the pictures and about two thirds are unusable i shoot in groups of three and only one if any of the photos are printable the response of the shutter button is inconsistent and unreliable the flash seem to be of inconsistent brightness the print resolution is poor i am very dissatisfied but since it was purchased over  days ago i may not get a replacement so i have to find a way to contact amazona piece of junk
13639,5,"has been  months now and its still doing great  some very minor scratches in the potthis is good for two people that eat a moderate or less amount or one person that eats an average or more amount maybe weekly if you eat more than that i would get a bigger rice cookerawesome little buddy"
913,1,this is a basic camera for the price while it has most basic features the image quality is disappointedly grainy and the sound quality is terrible whenever i record a video both with and without the microphone the camera produces a strange buzzing noise like a train rumbling over train tracks and i cant edit out or get rid of the weird soundthis was meant as a gift so when the camera was found defective it was already outside the return window when i contacted the seller they made it sound as if i had caused the problem anyways im never going to buy a cheap camera like this again and foolishly waste  camera but sound quality is poor
14060,2,"if toshiba gives a functional manual snd recipies id rate a it cooks great but has the worst  mist useless manual ever createdit cost nothing to write a sentence or two w cooking directions recipies and information on each per settingit says low card but no mention what rices one can or not use i want to cook brown rice on low carb nothing mentioned only has a preset timetry cooking steel cut oats on preset timeri had to invent the use of the quick rice setting for it did not allow porridge and guessed on increased water it worked and was great but i had to invent and lie in programming to doit is and feels very well made but sadly cheapened to get no functional instructions almost like buying used w a lost manual  shame on them very bad marketing and care for customer ease of useoh and there is nothings on toshiba webpage  only an odd short  minute of video only w music and artsy effects cartoon  there are only a few private youtube videos made hope you like taco rice bowls theres two homemade videos and thats it shame on toshiba if they would provide info then  stars without instructions only a twops i read while looking the claims of low carb results are strongly in question but i tested my glucose before and after pier low carb rice setting there was a slight gi increase but less than in past cooking conventionallybottom line  if you have patience creativity on practicing your own recipes snd settings then this is a good choice however if you want straight foward ease of use with clear instructions this is not a good choicecooks great once you figure out correct use awful instructions sad how little info or recipes given"
5856,2,do not think it was new the warranty card was filled out and the protection cover was off of the screendo not think it was new the warranty card was 
11942,4,we got this as our other cooker was still working but ovr  years old that will be donated to our granddaughter who is in college a good instruction manual and for white rice it is just push the start button i updated this as the wire rack is too easy to fall from its position the rack only needs to have a light weight for it to fall to the bottom pain all of the other racks and pans have no issues this is the only reason not to give it a  star ratingtop notch rice cooker but bad rack
1363,2,the camera is decent at photos but really shines when shooting video the sad part isthe best editing features are only on a phone or tablet not a computer so youll be editing on a tablet and then saving to your tabletphone then your want to send to your computer to create a video it appears to me that this is best suited when shooting short clips that can be edited and then included in your main videoill probably wait until they release the next x version that more of an action camera than thisdecent camera terrible software
2680,1,bought this for my  he loves it but he cant even play with it because ive been charging it for more than  hours and it only stays on if it is plugged in if i cant figure out how to keep it on without staying on the charger than i will be returning it first thing in the morningwont charge
8348,1,piece of crap toy dont purchase this expecting to take far away zoomed pics it wont do it zooms in the viewfinder but not on the lensthis camera will not take a zoomed pic with the supplied  lens
12350,5,"this is the biggest one that i boughtbut this funny machine does spit water  all over my table while its cooking so i put this little bowl over the hole and it stops the spitting and table mess yehhh i believe all these rice machines do spit water out though i may need a second one for the future of rice feeds  all day long and still have alot of left overget one u wont reegret it  investment everrr"
9056,2,i purchased a big box of film and have used  boxes and im frustrated that for me only one box has been reliable so far these are pictures i took this morning and they have three imprints on them in every photo the other two boxes dont have this issue seriously each box has been different and have developed all different i would say not to buy film on amazon because you dont know how the film is stored in warehouses ill probably never buy film again on amazon if you look at my ratings i mostly give five stars but am disappointed with this purchase i always figured with instant film its never going to be perfect but come onei guess its the luck of the draw on amazon
4883,1,i tried shooting several pictures different spots and all came out watery white such a waist since was for a bday gift and ended up with no time for other gift  so just keep in mind this  dont risk if a giftdont waist your money and time
2490,1,took a couple dozen pictures which were all bad used the highest res as well as others the worst shots came from flowers a couple feet away thay were blurry and way over saturated with color had high hopes for this little piece of dung anything that would work these days are way overpriced buy at your own risk maybe i had just purchased a bad onebad pictures
14327,5,the toshiba rice cooker works well so far i clean the rice in another bowl then dump the rice into the non stick pot it comes with measuring cup and has lines inside the pot to fill up to water level like  cups of rice needs water filled to  line in the pot from there you can adjust how moist you want the rice and keep in mind rice from different countries may cook differently it has other options like brown rice multigrain porridge etc the rice is cooked evenly and i do not see any area where the rice is cooked more than other areas in the potgood rice cooker with options to cook different types of grains and porridge
15612,5,this rice cooker is excellent extremely simple to use the directions are very clear comes with the measuring cup tells you exactly how much rice to how much water do you put the lid on and you flip the switch it automatically turns to keep warm cook the rice perfect and yeah it is super small to where it doesnt take up a lot of space on your counter holds  to  cups of rice already put together nothing to do but plug it in excellent purchase pretty good quality on the itemexcellent for kids
1291,1,i only used it once the lens is poor quality i would have sent it back but i had thrown away the boxps can send it back even so i have the manualit has a poor lens if enlarged
17119,5,very good design fast cookvery smart and fast
3248,1,hardly childs play add more money and buy something good the battery marking is incorrect and marks a full moment and an empty moment poor qualitycheap plastic
2366,2,play video it worked decently at first i really admire this camera took tons of photos until i ran out of films several weeks later having purchased an extra pack of films ready to start using it again the camera wouldnt eject the case so i figured it would have been a battery issue replaced it twice but to no avail then i switched to a different pack of films thinking it would have been that there was some fault with the current one still nothing then i noticed the led wouldnt stop blinking which was a bit unusual because it would normally blink a few times then remain on i left it on for a while thinking it was just recalibrating lo and behold my camera had stopped working great product not sure about the price but no longevity if youre looking for a good camera that will last you in the long haul go for a digitalfujifilm more like fujifake
2643,2,buttons are not user friendly and in the first  mins had to be restarted  wouldnt recommend unless you want to help all the time it will be quickly abandoned for other toys otherwise additionally the memory card is easily ejected by little fingers and could be a choking hazard not worth itnot user friendly and potential choking hazard
12228,5,"first one arrived damadged due to being packed upside down second arrived a day after i sent the old one back with the amazon replacement programweird that the clock stays on even when unplugged hopefully it does not die otherwise love ithave made brown basmati black and sushi rice mixed rice and beans rice and sweet potato rice and daikon even made a spiced rice with almonds and cranberries for thanksgiving that was a bit hit and saved me oven space the steam function overdoes the cooking a bit for me but that may just mean i need to take it out sooner i like veggies crunchy still its nice to have the basket so i can do multiple items when making rice for bentos not perfect but efficient to use it this wayhave not tried any of the wet items yet porridge stew or cake  but my husband loves how easy the inside marks are to see he can start this when he gets home and we have rice and whatever foe dinnerupdate november  can cook  cups of rice without burning or otherwise ruining rice the body is long so can be awkward when kept under a low cupboard as the steam rises hangs a bit off my counter to avoid this but not a deal breaker and i can move it to a table etc if i want fairly lightweight and well constructed i like that you can detach or move the paddle holder to either side or put it away if you dont use it may go make some more rice right nowupdate april cooker still works like new no peeling etc makes excellent steamed kabocha squash which may be the target of the steaming tray as it comes out perfect in  cubes  a bit mushe smaller porridge function works nicely after some training my husband was able to use it but he still forgets to wash the rice in which case it comes out a disgusting texture but that is no fault of the cooker top plate of the rice cooker getting a bit worn but its comes out for cleaning still works great for whole grains barley etc for which i use the mixed rice setting then add soy and sesame oil when doneupdate june  still love this rice cooker still works great the paddle holder broke a while ago and the nonstick coating is starting to get a few scratches but still easy to clean i found out running pork through the steam setting  times creates awesome pulled pork think tacos enchiladas bbq dumpling fillings or chinese black bean ribs amazing i have also made coq au vin in this thing soupsstews also come out great but do not forget to soak your beans overnight i have also used the steamer dish for steamed dim sum but it does stick without waxrice paper or banana leaves etc i have even slow cooked roasts in this with onionspepperscarrots and the like the quick setting works great for your typical parboiled store rice like trader joes brown basmati i would give up my microwave before this thing and my toaster possibly my stove wish i had one of these in collegejack of all trades"
1960,2,pictures arent great and video quality is bad forget trying to zoom in while filming its choppy and looks totally distorted you need to pay more for a camera with optical zoom the pictures are subpar youre better off using your phone you really have to be careful with reading reviews people have really low standard i will be returning thisreturning
13955,5,years ago i had a fuzzy logic rice cooker national brand made by panasonic and really loved it ive searched for the same one or similar but was having no luck  it was a  cup small and had a handle on the top this one does the job beautifully i wanted to be able to make a single serving of brown rice and have it waiting for me when i get home using the cup that comes with the rice cooker i fill to the  cup mark rinse the rice well add it to the pot and then fill with water to the  cup line i also add  to  tsp of salt i can either preset the timer to when i want the rice ready or start it when i leave the house and it will wait for me on warm until i get home i also cooked pinto beans   cup beans rinsed and soaked overnight in water  cups boiling water a tsp of salt and hit the brown rice button perfect beans very cool to have a multipurpose rice cooker i wish it had a cookbook that came with but the seller posted a link to some recipes which i figure i can tweak to make my own  keep in mind there are two sizes of this rice cooker so adjust recipes as needed very pleased with this purchaseperfect brown rice
13827,5,lots of simple features and capabilities i bought it mainly for good sticky rice sick to using the measuring cup that comes in the car to be sure your measurements are good the only down side is it takes nearly an hour to cook the rice but it comes out perfect had a keep warm feature as wellmakes excellent sticky rice
5324,1,the camera was not new and was missing the photo film and the framesnot new and missing pieces
11591,5,love itcomfee pressure cooker
12170,5,i had a  cups one purchased around  years ago when i live by myself and it works still very well today however my family size increases dramatically recently i have now a big family with two kids and  cups is not big enough for my family now so i am getting this  cups one the product is great as expected after  years i noticed some new deisgn for easy cleaninganother one after  years
11915,4,the reason i say this cooker is good for a first is because the pot is metal this might not seem like a big deal but it can make a difference for one thing stone pots dont burn food quite the same way as metal would because with a stone pot you can still eat burnt rice now dont get me wrong a metal pot can be great for cooling food down quicker but itll be easier to scratch if you use any tool material other than wood or plastic which means you will either be buying a replacement pot or a whole new unit after a few years so if you are or know a college student or a single person with little inclination to cook this rice cooker will work just fine however if you have had a rice cooker in the past then feel free to bypass this one just spend the extra money for a cooker with a stone pot 
7050,2,the pictures quality sucks the pic are way to blurry and dark cant even see the person on the picture its not worth buying it dont waste ur money on this cameradigital camera 
7847,2,regardless of how light originally pic is the tone it prints in is always the same its like a warm tone disappointed was really looking forward to displaying not worth the photos come out dark
12779,5,i have use the rice cooker for the last  day making food with it everydayrice cooker is they best
11888,5,"this was a major upgrade to the old rice cooker that i had to throw out the old one only had manual cook and keep warm features and all the food would stick to the panbut not with thisi am so happy with this rice cooker my rice came out super soft and fluffy as it should be it was perfect i have only made rice so far but i love the fact that it has such versatility too i eat quinoa just as much as rice so that function is also a plus i thought it was very easy to figure out on my own but the instructions are easy to follow too this is huge it doesnt take up a large amount of space but it can feed a team of people if you like to entertain this is for you my rice did not stick at all that is a huge deal for me so i didnt end up burning half of the rice in it and wasting food like with my old cooker it was also very easy to clean no scrubbing or harsh pads needed super lightweight for its size ill update if anything changes but im good for nowsuch an upgrade for me"
16837,5,easy and affordable optionrecommand
1107,2,first i could not set dates would set on todays date and it would change back to jan  to push the take picture button and had a delay before taking the picturenot worth the money sure there are better ones

9207,1,as soon as i turn it in had an error and wouldnt workbad quality
3714,1,lights works but there was no dealer namestamp on the warranty card that is required per viltrox so i cant register to get the warranty so even if it works now but something goes bad you will not have a warranty to get it fixedreplacedworks but no warranty card
15733,5,i like this rice cooker its an easy way for me to cook rice i couldnt cook rice and this made it so must easier without faillove

1451,1,this camera is junk do not buy it i had to contact the seller to get the software to download as it does not come with the camera even after installing the software the camera would not take a picture im returning this junk camera so save yourself some aggravation and time and dont buy itthis camera is junk
13553,5,used to cook rice in a panno more put rice in water in and hit the button and forget about it rice comes out cooked and stays warm would prefer some sort of notification other than a click when rice is done but now allows me to focus on other food prep instead of the rice love it good investment on making cooled rice and saving you timeauto pilot rice cooker
13861,5,so i upgraded my rice cooker machine and i bought this actually my husband pick this brand  its been a months i using this rice cooker i am very recommended because whenever i cook rice is perfect the texture and keep rice good even  days in rice cooker  very recommended
14479,5,for a family of  it does the job its so cute and sturdy daily used  so far so gooddoes the job
3136,1,dark pictures even in lighted areasdark pictures
15445,5,i mainly have use this for cooking rice so far it does a beautiful job on all the different types of rice that i cook wild rice brown rice sushi rice or just plain white jasmine rice everything has come out perfect no mess and easy cleanup super easy to use and very good quality some other reviewers have commented on how the timer doesnt turn on right away thats because this rice cooker waits until all the water has been absorbed before it starts the countdown this is why the rice comes out perfect every time it is important that you have the right rice to water ratio when you start also its important to remember that once you turn on the cooker and select your rice that you want to cook you have to press the start button again i look forward to traveling with this and using it to cook food on the road i also look forward to cooking pot roast soups and other dishes like chili and seeing how that turns out i bought this product for the reviews that i read and i will add to that with this  star rice cooker
3313,2,it is impossible to see anything on this camera even with my glasses on it says a camera for grandparents not so sorry i bought it need a magnifying glass with my glasses to work itdont buy for grandma
10479,5,"i purchased this little pink cutie to use with a solar battery i followed the directions for standard white long grain rice in the supplied recipe book and the rice came out great there was enough rice made to serve one or two people  depending on what a serving size means to you i love in a tiny type situation and have only one stove burner i had a small dinner party and used this little rice cooker to make seasoned green beans which turned out great i was able to put a  ounce can of green beans in this little rice cookeri also purchased from amazon a recipe book for use with small rice cookers going to try the chocolate cake recipe using this dash mini rice cooker the cookbook is called mini rice cooker cookbook i very much like this rice cooker very glad i purchased it one can find a variety of ways to use it on youtube i would purchase this dash mini rice cooker again and i recommend itgreat buy"
12927,5,excellent cooker ease of useexcellent cooker
465,1,returned no goodtoo expensive for a cheap camera
17493,5,i have to admit i was very hesitant to spend this much money on a rice cooker even though we are eating rice every day by chance we were at a relatives house and they had it and had great things to say so we took the plunge and absolutely love it it cooks the rice perfectly and also keeps the rice in good condition for a long time our prior rice cooker would leave the rice mushy andor dried out within a few hoursnot this oneamazing
15848,5,good deal for a six cup electric rice cooker the durable appliance has an enameled stainless steel pot with a non stick inner pot the versatile cooker has both a cook and warm setting great gift idea for new cooksrice cooker
566,2,the camera is fine operates fine has some nice features good build quality looks good however the quality of the photos are far less sharp and aesthetic than those taken by most new smartphones so its a bit of a waste if you have a high quality smartphone 
6232,2,it s bit bulky for my hand and camera i just could not get it to work right hard to see through the plastic its made bery well and for some other camera and lens maybe it would do better nikona bit bulky
12045,4,"this rice cooker makes consistently good rice for the price you should expect perfect rice every time and you can get perfect rice every time i would imagine that you might have to experiment with exact water levels in some cases or make minor adjustments but so far ive had good results with white rice jasmine rice and brown riceanother important feature of a rice cooker is simplicity of use once you put the rice and water in the inner cooking pan its a matter of pressing the start button you may have to set the type of rice you are cooking but only if it differs from the last time you used the machine and thats just a push of a button until the pointer is next to your desired settingcooking rice using a timer is also straightforward the machine is built under the assumption that you might like to have rice at a consistent time each morning or each evening so there are two timers prior to first use you set the times and thereafter its a matter of pressing the timer button once or twice before pressing the start button depending on which timer you are using then rice will be ready at that time and the only other thing you need to do is put the rice in with at least as much time it takes to cook up to  hours ahead of timethe machine makes  cups of rice meaning  measures of rice each measure is  oz which it the standard size a coffee cup of the cup and saucer variety cup is also a standard  oz us unit of measure which is why the product description warrants mention of this the manual makes it clear what is meant by cup and the number of cups is consistent with stated measurements of other rice cookers of varying brands but its inconsistent with many recipesthe rice cooker itself is fairly light in weight thats not necessarily a bad thing but it means that if you try to press certain buttons especially before you put rice and water in it the machine can slide and the buttons wont register so there are times i need two hands to set things meaning i have to make sure my other hand is free and clean rubber tips on the feet might have helped there is a large handle for moving the cooker so nonslip feet would not interfere appreciably with moving it and moving it will be necessary when cooking rice if you keep it on a counter under cabinets and sliding it forward will keep the steam from destroying thema minor annoyance is that theres no option for a  hour clock with an ampm indicator since this is made specifically for an english speaking market with a large american customer base this minor change would not be unwarranted on such an expensive product its not that its a major issue but neither would it have been a major engineering changethe pan is well designed and has measurements on both sides photos might show water levels for brown rice or for porridge because the markings on each side are different but the pan is large enough for more markings and some water levels are specified on an addendum to the instructions the instructions themselves cover the basic settings but certain common types of rice such as long grain or jasmine require levels different from whats indicated with level markings the extra instruction sheet tells you to measure water using the same cup you measure rice with if you keep that in your rice bin its an inconvenience to measure water with it dry it and put it backnone of the flaws are serious enough that i cant live with the machine or that im dissatisfied overall based on the strict definitions of stars since i like this product but it should warrant fewer stars amazon defines stars in terms of satisfaction not quality but giving this fewer stars might mislead people into assuming that i consider this a mediocre product thats certainly not the case its just that for the price they could have done a bit more and those few things would have been little effort for them and would not have raised the cost of the machine in any significant way its not that measuring water on my own is a formidable task but the purpose of the machine should be to make great rice with as little effort as possiblei wouldnt take off points for the misuse of the term cup but if amazon hasnt fixed the listing by now id encourage as many customers as possible to click on the problems with this listing linkmakes good rice but has design flaws"
10196,4,bought this for saving time in the kitchen and it works fine the measurements and instructions are super helpful still figuring out all that it can do but so far so goodquick and convenient
14811,5,two cooking speeds are handy the warming function keeps rice warm without drying out for at least two days thumbs upcooks and keeps warm
13279,5,loved this product bought  for business and family works great and they all love it compact for a kitchen nice  rice cooker
301,2,really looked forward to the video quality on this camera but unfortunately i had problems with it not stopping when i wanted to stop recording this happened a couple of time and it wouldnt even turn off when i switched it to offreally looked forward to the video quality on this camera 
14786,5,"this is rice maker is the first in many fail products ive tried that works beautifully im writing this review after  of use and owning the productmakes perfect rice with moist texture water level need to be correct but the rice also doesnt spoil within  hours by the machine a great investment and worth the money for small family or busy individualbought three more as giftsdefinitely worth the investmentgreat investment"
13815,5,"updatecooked brown rice perfectlycooked white rice perfectlykeep warm great kept rice warm for next meal not dried out still perfecthave not tried the timer function yet and not sure we would need toas a youngster i was taught to cook rice in a regular pot pour in rice add water up to first line on finger now years later technology has refined the rice cookerjust got it in read instructions guess what was the first thing cooked in itnot rice stuffed peppers used the slo cook settings cooked for three hours it did pretty well perhaps slightly over done should have knocked the time down  minutes next timethe selection buttons are very touchy any light touch when handling the cooker will take selectionclean up was quite easy the inner lid comes out by sliding the latch under the right front of the lid make sure you have the free hand ready to catch the inner lid when released reinserting make sure the bottom of the lid is behind the retaining pegs push until it clicks in place the steam opening at the rear of the lid needs checking for cleaning its easily removed by pulling up at the rear its just a press fit it comes in two pieces and is held together by a snap clipwe will be using it mostly for cooking rice but was curious as to the other features so far its a winner and a far cry from cooking rice in a pot recommended buyhow far weve come"
13364,4,basic rice cooker reasonable pricereasonable price
10855,5,right size for family of  and actually i use it to make dog food too and it cooks the perfect amount simple and great love the one button and go functiongreat
10086,5,this rice cooker is the perfect size for a single person  couple or small family im a big fan of the nonstick inner lining being the healthier granite coating and not being teflon coated love all the different grain settings ive never been able to cook rice correctly but with this the texture of the grains is perfect every timethe price on this was good as well very pleasedperfect rice every time
13384,5,cook rice every daygood quality
6581,2,we tried this camera in all types of lighting conditions and it seldom focused at full zoom when the camera thought it focused and took the photo it still was not a crisp photo when viewed on the computer the macro is pretty good but who needs a supposedly great long distance camera for that i returned the item and they only refunded about  bucks short of the price i paid i have tried to contact them and they fail to respond order a better camera from another seller also there is no free return postage on this item so expect to pay  to ship it backdoes not focus at distance
5908,2,bought the redpink one and while the amazon box was fine the actual box the camera came in was opened already and there is missing a charger im not sure what thats aboutmissing charger open box
13459,5,i have this rice cooker at my main home and i bought a second one for my cottage this is a useful appliance no burnt rice the  oz cup measure and the line on the inner bowl measure water and rice perfectlyperfect rice at a low cost
2038,1,camera cost a fortune picture quality is worse than pictures taken in the  century dont buy this buy a similar product from a different company the picture was taken in bright conditions from  feet awayhorrible quality
274,1,please see attached picture before buying it was not disclosed that uploading photos could no longer be done directly from the camera i found out when i opened the package and started reading the infoservices discontinued in 
6517,1,after one month and a couple of uses there is a light that continues to shine bottom middle of panel after the unit is turned off and the dials are turned to their minimum values the only time it goes off is when the battery has completely dischargedwill not completely turn off
1904,1,my camera wont turn on after one month unable to get ahold of the company so its just wasted moneybroke
16670,5,i use this daily and have for months now makes perfect rice every time my favorite setting for white jasmine rice is the savory white comes out restaurant quality i also love that you can make a big batch of rice and it will hot hold it for  without burning or drying it out super easy clean takes  to hand wash cause theres never stuck on rice i dont recommend the cleaning setting on it as it leaves residue if you dont rinse the pot thoroughly first my only complaint is that the buttons wont work if you have wet hands like i always do after washing my rice perfect rice everytime plus hot hold for

15735,5,very cute rice cooker its small and perfect for just a few servings of rice for me on the daily the ceramic pot itself is really easy to clean up and it doesnt leave burnt rice at the bottom or anythingcute and easy rice cooker
1740,1,just went on a once in a lifetime trip to japan camera didnt worknot reliable
3630,2,about half the film that came with this camera was damaged and had large white spots with damage visible on the back side of the film too so i know it wasnt just bad lightingfilm comes damaged
4902,1,camera would only work for few minutes at a time i took it for snorkeling coral reef and it stopped working after a few pics were taken battery was fully charged and i had the appropriate sized card in it very disappointed in product i should have just bought a  camera the snorkel place was offeringcamera
318,2,i initially rated this camera as  stars see review below but i dropped that rating down to  stars my reason for doing so is that i have an unanswered question about the cameras ability to handle highspeed burst mode photographyi had this camera for just under two weeks during that time i put it through some rigorous testing  different scene modes  video highspeed burst mode birds in flight hummingbirds feeding at my nectar feeder etc most of the time the camera performed without any problems however on four separate occasions it gave me a write error three times were after shooting in burst mode but once was when just shooting a single picture these errors happened with two different sd memory cards a pny high speed class  card and a sandisk  card both of my memory cards conformed to panasonics specifications so there shouldnt have been any problem whatsoever in writing to them twice in conjunction with receiving the write error all of the photos that i had previously saved on the sd card just disappeared it was as though the camera decided to format the card in order to recover from the write error im not a techno geek but since the write errors occurred when using two different memory cards i felt confident the problem was with the camera and not my memory cards as such i decided to return the camera for a refundwhen i bought my  it was through one of amazons third party sellers i see now that it is also being sold directly by amazon but the seller changes based on available stocknormally when an item is returned because of a problem or defect amazon will pay the return shipping when i bought my camera amazon didnt have it in stock its back in stock as of this writing consequently i bought my  from americacamera ie one of amazons third party sellers when i returned it the seller merely sent me an address label but they made me pay the return postage even so that was better than keeping a lemoni returned my camera via usps priority mail with tracking so i knew exactly when my camera was received by them six days after they had received it back they had done nothing to issue my refund consequently i contacted amazons customer support for assistanceon my behalf amazon sent the seller an email requesting they promptly issue my refund so two days later i get a partial refund the seller said they found no problem with the camera i returned hence they charged me an  restocking fee ie almost  i replied to their email and said that was not acceptable since the camera was indeed defective i also said that if necessary i would file and az claim through amazon in order to obtain my full refund at that same time i also contacted amazons customer support againthe next day i received the following email from the seller which i am quoting verbatim complete with the lack of punctuation and spelling error mam the camera has no defect and we tried the camera and its working properly without any defect as a courtesy will refund you the remainder for now  we can always recharge you again if feecbacks or az claims are filed for no reasoni dont know how others might take their reply but i certainly took it as a threat right wrong or indifferent no company is going to threaten me for providing my feedback or for filing a claim when i feel ive been cheated out of a refund that is due personally i still believe the camera i got was defective whether or not the seller was able to duplicate the errors i got with it but if as the seller said the camera has no defect then its possible the  cant always handle buffering and writing when you push the limit of its high speed burst mode in either case im not willing to take the chance of buying another  camerasince americacameras did issue me a full refund which they said was a courtesy there wasnt a need for me to file an az claim after receiving my refund i probably should have just let the matter drop but i hated the thought that they might sell that camera to someone else consequently i replied to their email and explained that the problem i had was an intermittent one the camera worked find most of the time but the errors i received were indeed real not merely an attempt to avoid paying a restocking fee all i could think of was pity for the poor person who might have the same error occur during a onceinalifetime vacation or special eventso once again quoted verbatim heres the reply i got back from americacamera mam we issued a full refund no need to prove if it has a defect or not we already shipped it to another customer and they are using it with no issuesok heres the bottom line the amazons customer support folks stood by me but its sad they allow such a company to be one of their thirdparty sellers with that said just beware who you buy from before buying anything from a thirdparty seller be sure to check their seller feedback if i had followed that advices it would have saved me a whole lot of aggravationnow here is the original review i wrote for my  main photographic interests are travel nature and wildlife over the years ive owned everything from the most basic point and shoot camera to a midrange dslr the  has so many bells and whistles and buttons that it would be impossible for me to review them all im still learning the ins and outs of using this camera but here are some of my initial impressionscamera bodythe  is a considerably heavier than the other bridge cameras ive owned its weight is on par with an entrylevel dslrthe heavier camera body is probably partially due to the  having a splash  dustproof body be aware that splashproof does not mean waterproof if you drop it in a swimming pool it will most likely be a goner on the other hand if you get caught in a light rain sprinkle the camera will most likely survive the ordeal an unexpected rain storm recently fried the electronics in my canon  camera so the splash  dustproof body was one of the deciding factors in my purchasing an  as its replacementnext the cameras body has entirely too many buttons and dials in my opinion there are  different buttons and dials so its almost impossible to handle the camera without accidentally hitting one of themthe slider button which is used to open the flash is very tiny small and difficult to operate and thats coming from a lady with small hands also the plastic hinges on the flash unit feel cheap im a bit concerned that they might easily breakthe  comes with a rather cleverly designed lens hood when you want to block out side light the hood attaches onto the lens normally and when you dont want to use the lens hood it can be attached backwards onto the lens that way you always have it with the cameramode dial settingsin addition to the common mode setting intelligent auto shutter priority aperture priority full manual program mode etc  the mode dial has a few other useful settingstaking panoramic pictures with the  couldnt get any easier after choosing panoramic mode focus on the starting point and press the shutter button then pan across the entire scene when you reach the end press the shutter button again its that easy the camera automatically stitches your panoramic images together for you i absolutely love this feature especially for scenic landscape shotsthe scene mode and the creative control mode each have some interesting artistic settings ive yet to play around with them but they do look like theyll be fun to usemonitor  viewfinderthe  has both an articulating monitorscreen and also a viewfindereyepiecethe monitor is touchsensitive which can be quite handy for performing some functions one of the touch features i particularly like is the ability to touch an area of the screen in order to tell the camera to use that area as the exposure metering point this feature is especially useful when shooting picture in mixed lighting situationson the down side its easy to accidently touch the screen and end up in menu or function where you dont want to be fortunately the menu settings allow you to turn off some or all of the touchsensitive controlsas for the viewfinder it is bright and clear it also has a sensor that automatically switches from the monitor screen to the viewfinder whenever the camera is placed up to your  video  burst rate photosone of the big selling points for the  is its  video you can take a video clip and then extract a single frame to produce an  still image i initially thought this feature would be something id enjoy using but thats not the case i prefer to do my postprocessing on my computer but the image extraction has to be done within the cameraon the other hand the  had a very nice burst rate in high speed burst mode it takes  pictures per second and in medium speed burst mode it takes  pictures per second although panasonic recommend using an ultra high speed  sc card ive been able to capture  seconds worth of high speed burst shots with my high speed class  sd card after that the camera had to pause momentarily in order to record the imagesfocusingthe  has both a single autofocus and a continuous autofocus mode in addition it has a manual focus modeboth of the autofocus modes respond a bit more slowly as compared to other digital cameras ive hadfor both single autofocus and continuous autofocus mode i have the camera settings set to not take pictures if theyre out of focus even so ive found myself getting far too many blurry photos especially when using the cameras burst mode hopefully this will improve once i become more familiar with using my new cameraat full zoom my camera frequently fails to autofocus at all if i back off the zoom a bit it will then focus okay i need to call panasonic to see if this is a problem with my particular camera or if this situation is inherent to the  has anyone else had this problem if so please leave a comment and let me knowas for manually focus a picture the  is the first digital camera ive ever owned that has an easy to use manual focus mode one of the levers on the cameras body lets you easily change between single autofocus continuous autofocus and manual focus modes in manual focus mode the center section of the image enlarges to assist with the manual focusing then a rolling dial located on the left side of the cameras lens is used to make the necessary focus adjustmentmenu systemthe menu system on the  is fairly similar to the menu systems found on most other digital cameras the problem is that this camera has so many features and functions that it is difficult to find the setting youre looking for furthermore the menus arent consistent in some cases an unavailable setting will be dimmedgrayed but in other cases it simply doesnt appear on the menuimage qualityfor me the most important thing about a camera is its image quality all the bells and whistles in the world arent worth anything if a camera takes lousy pictures i have gotten some excellent photos with my  but ive gotten some pretty lousy pictures too overall id say its about half and half in perfect lighting this camera takes outstanding pictures on the other hand taking pictures in shadowy situations yielded some pretty poor results unfortunately i cant always control the environment im trying to take pictures in and often times the subject is too distant for the flash to do any good for my first real test of this camera i tried it out at our local zoo the animals werent dumb so a lot of them were sitting in the shade those pictures came out terrible with low contrast even shooting in raw mode and then tweaking the pictures yielded mediocre resultsthe  has a  zoom but its only a  megapixel camera in actual use the  zoom is fine for larger wildlife but my pictures of small animals rabbits squirrels etc and bird have been disappointing with only  megapixels to work with cropped photos quickly become over pixilatedif it werent for the image quality id give the  a  rating but since this is such an important factor i can only give the camera an average  ratingbattery lifefor a bridge camera the  battery life is about average the users manual says you can take about  pictures between charging since ive done a lot of playing around with burst mode shots it hasnt taken me very long to drain the battery my next amazon purchase will definitely be a couple spare batteries and a  sd carda lot to like but some dislikes too
13475,5,superb construction and performance had high expectations and it met them very happysuperb
1312,1,this camera was horrible i bought this for my daughter for a girls camp to take pictures and every time she opened it she can never see a picture of what she wants to take a picture of i think i got jipped off and spent  for a broken camerathis camera was horrible
13170,4,come on whens the last time you saw a rice cooker for  i shopped around after my toshiba finally gave out after  years most rice cookers are in the  plus range so i was surprised by the tayama for  so far it works just fine makes a small mess at the steam vent but easy to clean the rice on the bottom layer gets cooked into a hard pancake but the upper rice is fine will it last as long as my old toshiba probably not but for now shell do just finesurprising value
74,2,for the price this is a decent camera if youre just looking to take photos at close range once you zoom out the picture quality deteriorates significantly youll notice in the video on the cameras amazon listing page that the people in the video are only taking phots  feet from each otherpicture quality at close range is pretty good the zoom is awful
12524,5,our old one different brand wasnt working very well so bought this one holds more and worksgreatworks great
4113,2,this is my final revision update ive had these cameras for  months now and ultimately i believe theyre nice to have but totally unreliable unfortunately theyre the only affordable option i have for the area i want covered driveway but i had to purchase  cameras for this one area and its still unreliablereliability or lack there ofi can walk out get in my car and drive off totally undetected if its missing me theres really no telling what all is being missedive played with the settings a lot including the sensitivity and ive moved the cameras around i have one set for  recordings but it doesnt always record that long yesterday it only recorded  seconds total of my arrival and missed my departure entirelyqualityi have it set to the lowest quality for the longest battery life but the video is still generally acceptable but every now and again i get a green screen and halostrails or outright jumpy motion still mostly good enough to assist if there was a crimebatterythe batteries are very long lasting though my oldest camera is still showing full and ive had it for at least   update im still using but get so frustrated i had actually forgotten id already posted a review so was intending to post one now ill just update instead im no longer getting the halos but still miss a lot it frequently misses my coming and going but it has recorded some people checking my car door locksjust not sure how many it has missed though i do think if theres a large enough commotion with lots of motion the cameras will work its also nice to able to remotely view and record whenever i want im up to  cameras now and im grateful to have free  recordings my other cameras are not free so i really appreciate freereassuring to have but not  reliable
10508,5,"decided to buy a mini rice cooker due to not needing a bigger rice cookerwas a bit smaller than i anticipated but it makes enough rice for me and my wifeseems to cook the rice just right and keep warmalso really easy to clean and it also comes with a little recipe booklet to make other delicious foodslove dash and all their products as well has to be one of my favorite brands for kitchen appliancesmini cooker"
16930,5,i bought this rice cooker a couple weeks ago and im going to compare this rice cooker to the aroma that i bought from walmart this is the best purchase i made so far in  i was in need of a rice cooker that would actually cook my rice i was always having trouble with the aroma rice cooker cooking my rice thoroughly and this one does the job its easy to clean and easy to use i am so in loveamazing
16958,5,love love love this rice cooker makes the perfect rice and between the sleek look and amount it serves this is a great buybest rice cooker
4153,1,turns on but does not work at allnever worked
9492,5,i honestly bought this just to make rice and its honestly pretty good its small but honestly worth the pricepretty good
14867,4,"a good cooker for the money  stars because you get what you pay for but their descriptions of what you are getting and what it is is another storyit says its for  cups it is not  cups you can see from the picture their cup is really  of a standard size cup i found this was good for the  of us with a bit left over sometimes it is more like  cups when making rice the standard way about  cups if i put in all  of their cups it wont take more than that but i havent used more than  worried it will spill over the pictures show  of their cups used it takes about  min cooking time using iti like that it has a stainless steel bowl so i dont have to deal with the non stick chemicals a lot of these are made in countries that do not have the fda watching out for the chemicals that they put into them and you are cooking into your food i havent found non stick is needed on theseusing it is not difficult i am the worst at cooking rice why i bought this but it can brown some of the rice on the bottom if you keep the warm going for a bit when it is doneall in all i like that i can put it in and not worry about forgettingburning it and have another burner on the stove available to cook dinner i wouldnt try to cook lots of different things in it but i didnt buy it to be adventurous i would go with an allinone then and not bother with thisgreat for a family of   not standard  cup size"
12375,5,i love this rice cooker super easy to use and clean very straight forward and doesnt take that long for it to cook the ricehighly recommend it
6214,1,this thing is okay its a real hassle to use but it gets the job done we do a lot of hiking and were in the pnw so lots of rain and drizzle plus lots of cast off from waterfalls so i feel like it protects my camera enough but as other reviews said this is best if youre using a tripod and a remote its very awkward two use with your hands i dont love it and wouldnt buy again kept it because its cheap and something to protect my camera with for nowi dont recommend it
14980,2,after just a few uses the rice cooker would click off before the rice was done so we tried just heating up water to a boil and after a few mins the bottom of the pan looked like this looks like whatever the silver coating is comes offdidnt last long
6972,1,this polaroid camera is absolutely horrible and a waste of money if i could give it zero stars i would i originally bought this polaroid since it prints larger size pictures than the average polaroid by no means am i a professional photographer but it is a hobby of mine i have stored this polaroid with my other camera gear which go anywhere from  a piece and up the polaroid camera broke on me even though it was extremely well taken care of every single picture i took would come out blurry  and i have a clue to what i am doing when it comes to camerashorrible camera  horrible quality pictures
2796,2,cute camera for my  year old but it started glitching less than  hours after she started using it screen freezes when trying to view pictures requiring you to remove the battery to turn off and reset not worth the pricestarted glitching on day 
3168,2,bought two pack both antennas rotate and fall off why both very small portions broken off as seen in photographs spypoint just said i could order new antennas i think its a design flawboth antennas broken
3633,1,camera was purchased as a christmas gift had not tried to use before the return window closed found that the camera does not work and cannot be returned item is under warranty with fuji film but now i must pay shipping to have it replaced under the warranty i hope that within  weeks i will have a functioning camera but this is disappointing to say the least as it was expected to be a fun experience to share with my girlfrienddid not work

8587,1,honestly have no idea what anyone here is talking about i can see the ghosting and lagging anytime i swing my arms even when its on the lowest quality only does  not matter what quality use your iphones peoplelags
7607,2,product is made very cheap the color screens are crap the pull tabs leave marks on them when you take them off theres no camera i think its over price for what it ison the cheap side
6737,2,not worth the price the material attracts everything so if you plan to use this outside its going to get dirty if you have pets the pet hair will be all over it if you take it on a hike or long walk prepare to be uncomfortable as this bag is not comfortable at all it is nice on the inside and does fit my camera  lenses go pro gear water bottle tripod and other small things i wish i went with something else mostly because i cant stand that everything sticks to the materialget a different bag
8671,1,it did not tell you that you must purchase a sd card to take more than one test picture so buyer beware that you must purchase a card my daughter opened the camera and could only take one picture this was ridiculous and very disappointingbuyer bewqre
7853,2,i do not recommend this product overall if you are printing singular pictures its fine overall color is dull but multiselect almost always has an error says it ran out of print paper when it didnt and random errors also interface with the app does not keep your spot where you left off so be ready to scroll through your pictures constantly to find the one you wanted or batches of themannoying but does the job
3966,1,i am very unhappy with this purchase after one picture worked the rest were black i sent it in to be fixed and was sent back a camera that doesnt work in a whole new way i regret this purchase and am sad that i lost money on a camera that could only take one pictureone picture and then the camera broke

9765,5,"i was unsure about picking this up but my kids insisted i needed one and they love rice im now sorry i didnt agree earlier this comes with a plastic steamer basket coated inside pot directions and a measuring cup its super simple to use and the directions were easy to understandthe pot is large enough to make enough rice for two to three meals and thanks to the measuring cup its simple to dump it in and just let it cook away without thought it peeps once when done but holds the contents warm until turned offwhich makes my life easier and the rice and oatmeal always turn out greatthe pot is easy to clean and doesnt have issues with sticking of course only plastic or wood should be used with itas said i enjoy using this device a lot and would buy it again but im hoping this one holds for a long timemakes rice and oatmeal so a breeze"

17201,1,"i received my instant zest ricegrain cooker yesterdayive owned several cheaper rice cookers that just had the start switch nothing programmable yet they did what they were supposed tomy new instant zest came with a  measuring container i dont want to use the term cup as a cup is a unit of measure an instruction booklet with estimated cook times and measurements were also includedlast night i made brown rice in the instant device i used the included  measuring container instead of a cup of rice and i added   cup  fluid ounces of water selected brown rice and the appliance did its thing the estimated cook time in the included booklet for brown rice is shown as  minutes so hardly instant my cheaper rice cookers can get me finished brown rice in about  minutes at the end of cook cycle the device showed end and went into the keep warm setting like other appliances do the rice was a little drier than i like but it was okthis morning i tried the instant to make oatmeal i use old fashioned oats not quick oats stove top directions call for boiling for  minutes with this type of oat i was very surprised to see that the instant estimated cook time for oats on page  of the getting started guide show  minutes for oatmeal hardly instant in any event i thought i would give it a try i used the same  measuring container that was included with the device for the oats then i used my liquid measures for the  cups  fluid ounces of water upon starting a  minute timer started counting down again not really instant when stove top takes  minutes plus a few minutes to get the water to boil at the onseti checked on it again and when the unit showed end meaning the cook cycle had finished i opened the lid to be greeted with hot oatmeal gushing out the top of the steam vent in the lid down my cabinets and all over the counter it was milky in color and almost a soupy consistency after a fair amount of time wiping up the mess off my counters and floors i was able to get to the inner pot below about an inch of milky looking water was the cooked oatmeal when i removed the inner pot more oatmeal spilled into the base dripping from the nonremovable lid creating another mess inside the appliancevery disappointed in this device the instructions and the length of time the instant appliance takes to accomplish its basic task  minutes for  minute oats cmon manreceived response from instapot support and was informed that the grain to water ratios included in the booklet that came with the appliance were incorrect page  lists  grain to water ratios and  of the  are incorrectif the booklet did not contain the incorrect ratios i would have rated this product higher as once i compensated for that error and used the correct  ratio for brown rice my rice turned out perfectlyi still would not recommend it for oatmeal for my steel cut oats i still use my pressure cooker for perfect oatmeal no messmakes a mess of oatmeal  minutes to cook  minute oats"
2272,1,i bought this for my daughter to take to thailand it lasted her two days before it broke the lens wont close it will power itself on if you replace the batteries but then it cant power off close then lens or function afterward im glad that she had her cell phone camera as a backup dont waste your money on thisdoesnt last
8552,1,i was excited when i got my instax mini  this morning i open the box to see that half the airplus bubblerap is popped so half of the camera was exposed to be banged and hit it did not come with a battery and battery charger also didnt come with film but i was expecting that so im just stating what it didnt and did come with all it came with was instructions and a tiny strap for the camera maybe i just got unlucky and my order was bad idk this sucks bad packaging  missing items

17522,5,had instant pot for rice cooking for years and need to try a dedicated rice cooker got a tiger cooker from costco w good price but returned quickly for non induction and no removal top lid after hrs research i settled this one and no complaints after weeks the rice smells so good and my whole family like the taste of different rices cooked with ittop quality and rice smell so good
12080,5,"after several days of research and reading the other great reviews here on amazon i knew that zojirushi was the best brand hands down while i know it like many other appliances i have are considered a luxury appliance it saves me lots of time more importantly this rice maker makes it very convenient for me to incorporate more grains into my familys dietwow from the moment i opened the box i was in love with this rice cooker i chose this model for the price with all the additional features that most cookers dont have color option while i have stainless steel appliances my kitchen is earth tones so this fits in nicely on my counter the different types of ricegrains it will cook brown rice i knew from my research that i wanted a cooker with fuzzy logic sound signals might seem weird but i notice the music if im somewhere other than the kitchen to inform me when the rice is done i dont always recognize a beeper if i also have the oven on yes you can set to music beeper or silent love the fact that i dont have to reset the clock when its unplugged there is a bonus steamer with this model great for throwing in some veggies to accompany your dish youre making very easy to clean the nonstick inner cooking pan and inner lid that should be cleaned after every use nice to have the bonus rice spatula spatula holdernever have to worry where the spatula is and the measuring cupive made rice almost everyday since my rice cooker arrived on monday the first batch was a little undercooked but that was operator error i didnt put the right amount of water in the cooker with the rice i always use instant rice so there was a bit of a learning curve there for me now i have the confidence to cook other variations ive had a fun field trip to wholefoods and purchased many varieties of rice i continue to learn about other grains and have ventured into making quinoa and tobouli as wellmy  year old daughter has informed me that she will be taking it with her to college along with my vitamix   so she can make sticky rice she especially loves this cooker because i was able to make sticky rice for her to take for lunch to school with her seaweed yes i understand this isnt typical for most kids to take for lunch as this isnt something we normally eat at home nor is it part of our culture but hey if i can keep my kiddo happy and she eats her entire lunch then its a winwin for me if she does take it to college ive already got my eye one another zojirushi cookermy husband didnt understand why i needed a rice cooker when rice is so easy to make true however neither of us can make a perfect batch of rice evrytime we cook rice the beauty of the zojirushi brand and fuzzy logic is that it ensures perfect rice everytime he gets it now and loves it just as much as i do hes even trying more grains he wouldnt normally eat we now plan our meals around what we can make with the variety of new grains weve begun eating i call that a successthis is the rice cooker you need to have"
7913,1,kodak is a trusted brand right so i bought this and thought i can rely on the credibility under its name the very first and single print was perfect i was happy but that is only for  minute literally one minute after that the nightmare started unable to connect paper jammed pictures are not printed correctly even the phone app sucks i totally get it how they wanted to make things super easy for people to use this but really this is a total waste of time and money yes money not eligible for return and their customer service reply takes  days thats probably better than a week but hey i paid this immediately and i had to wait days to hear back not fair right i had to pay for shipping because they wont even tell you that they can pay for it until you ask and it took another  days for them to reply after i asked and i had to ship it back to them right away because i dont want to keep it longer and they might not give me a refund now they told me they cant refund the shipping for some senseless reasoning so people do yourself a favor skip this product dont buy itdont buy this it will cause you stress and frustration

16215,2,"lets stop lying about this product it is the least convenient way to make rice i have ever seen it is much easier to cook rice in a microwavelike so many people i watched my asian friends cook rice in rice cookers its so convenient they scoop the rice in the rice cooker add water push the cook button and it works moreorless like a toaster it cooks the rice automatically and shuts off they can load it in a minute start it and forget itbut not this rice cooker lets do this in chronological order the first time i used it it stunk up the entire house with the smell of burnt transformer windings i was afraid to eat the rice even though i washed it before use i feared the smell might have been some coating left on the cooking pan which is part of the devicebut the real problem is one of weights and measures this is rated as a  rice cooker that means it is supposed to produce  cups of rice for context a cup is defined as a volume of  fluid ounces so when loaded to the maximum it should produce  ounces of rice it does not here is where the story gets really complicated how do you know how much rice and how much water to add to cook a serving of ricethis should be simple but no they caution you to use the supplied measuring cup if you read the small users manual accompanying the cooker you will find it contains the caution that their cup the supplied measuring cup is not  ounces they claim it is  and they claim that if you fill the cooker completely with  of their  oz cups of rice it will produce  of their  oz cups of cooked rice ok write this off to misunderstanding due to poor translaation of chinglish and move on but thats not the full storyto use this cooker at all you must follow the instructions very carefully the instructions say to do things in the following order measure the desired amount of uncooked rice into the supplied miniature measuring cup this numerically represents half of the cooked volume of rice you wish to prepare pour this rice into the cooker nb this is before you add water to the cooker add water to the cooker already containing the uncooked rice up to the numeric measure line whose label matches the amount of uncooked rice you previously measured into their special supplied miniature measuring cupthe first problem everyone seems to encounter is that the nonstandard volume measurement markings on the  independent devices do not match any standard volume nor do they match each other it is very difficult to make sense of them or the instructions about them eg who has ever heard of measuring water into a vessel after a bunch of other solid pellets have already been loaded and trust me if you add water up to the appropriate marking in the cooking pan before you add the rice to the cooking pan it will result in the rice cooker boiling over making a tremendous mess on the counter and there will be lots of dried rice material glued to the bottom of the cooking pan so be careful to measure the rice and water only precisely as it says in the manual and only using their supplied measuring cup and only in the order dictatedfurther inconvenience includes the rice will stick to the bottom of the pan if you dont take the lid off and stir the rice at least every  minutes during the cooking cycle you must use a nonmetallic  either teflon plastic or wooden  utensil to stir the rice or you will scratch the teflon off the supplied cooking pan ruining the cooker the plastic spatula supplied with the cooker is much too large to use with the cooker the numbers embossed in the tupperwarelike measuring cup supplied with my cooker are virtually impossible to see they are so lightly scratched into the clear pvc that you have to hold the cup near a light and at just the right angle to see the markings at all the markings indented into the side of the black teflon cooking pan are even more difficult to see since you must compare them to the level of water within the pan you can only use them from the inner teflonblack side of the pan its best to bring a flashlight or you can carry the pan  already loaded with rice  to a location near a lightbulb where you can add the water while viewing the measurement levelsi know a bunch of you are wondering why cant i just measure the proper amounts of constituents once and use a real measuring cup henceforward well you can but heres the rubit turns out the supplied cup is not actually  ounces its closer to  fluid ounces so if you want to make  ounces of cooked rice use  real ounces of rice but you still have to determine how much water by carefully measuring the amount of water required to match the number  marking on the cup and the side of the pan while it already contains one of their measure of rice i determine thata smidgen over  ounces of rice requiresabout  ounces of wateryou dont want to make more than  of their uncooked cups of rice because cooking only one of their  oz cups of rice will cause the cooker to boil over and the mess it makes is even worse if you fill it furtheri have tried the trick suggested by previous reviewers of draping a small towel over the top of the cooker including the steamvent hole in the lid this suggestion certainly helps but it in no way prevents a mess when the thing boils over the best thing is to just watch it carefully and when it boils up remove the lid and let the boiledup bubbles recede if you can catch it before it boils over at least that is one less mess to clean upthe cooker will automatically switch from cook to warm after about  minutes but according to the companys directions you have to warm the rice for  minutes more to prepare it properly ive tried the shortcut of skipping the warm cycle and it doesnt result in good ricedont forget that it doesnt have an off switch so you have to unplug it after every use which means you have to wait around for it to finish cooking entirely before you can move on to whatever you had scheduled to do next this thing is terribly inconvenient to use it saves no time it wastes your time rather than startandforget you have to mind it throughout the entire  minutes or so of cooking cycle stirring the rice every  minutes and unplugging the cooker when you are done this cooker never shuts off automatically it stays on warm which may well be hot enough to catch fire after it dries out your rice completelyand the claims of how much it rice it will prepare being derived from the assumption that a cup is  ounces are fraudulenti have been using black  decker tools for most of my life they are usually reliable dependable and very high quality but for black  decker to put their name on this product is a sham for shame whoever approved or tested this product at black  decker should immediately be fired shame on you black  decker shame on you for soiling the reputation of your honorable brandinconvenient to the max"
5664,1,the product is very misleading its my mistake for purchasing a  camera expecting it to have decent quality but in reality my phone camera is  betterthe camera is not in  quality
12050,5,"first off the background we joke that i have destructive superpowers i can break almost anything usually without meaning to we bought this rice cooker in  hoping it would save me time effort and energy almost  years later and this thing is still going strong with weekly use and minimal to no maintenance put rice in with watersaltbutter get perfectly cooked rice out every time even through several different types of rice wash the pot and youre donecan not sing the praises high enough of this has saved me so much time since my husband eats chicken and rice weekly most weeks love love this rice cooker and if ours does ever give out it will be the fastest rebuy i ever do look no further youve found the rice cooker you  years and still going strong"
10592,5,i purchased this for my husband who was having difficulty perfecting rice this thing is absolutely foolproof perfect rice in  min  no exceptions lid needs a bit of attention to ensure that its clean but the rest of it could almost be wiped clean in a pinch we do not put this away  it stays on the counter and is used several times a week great purchasemy husband loves this
149,1,got a gift and it stopped working after a weekstopped working after a week
13645,5,we got this as a gift for our son he loves it makes great rice every time no more burned rice and would highly recommendsuper for one or two people
15490,4,came to me a bit banged up but it didnt seem to mess up anything on the inside cooks our rice great and even comes with a booklet for things you can cook in it as well its a nice cooker dent or notsmashed but works
15483,4,"this is very simple to use just add the rice and water push the button and in less than  minutes you have perfectly cooked rice it doesnt stick to the pot so far and clean up is a breeze with this the enamel coating on the pot feels like is should be durable and is very nonstick which is better than other materials i have seen i have a different one and with that the lid was impossible to get fully clean this just goes into the dishwasher and comes out ready to go it comes with a small recipeidea booklet but i wasnt really too inspired by it it was a nice touch thoughsize wise this is perfect for a few people it wont work for a large family it is lightweight and pretty compact so doesnt require a lot of space for storage i find myself using it a couple times a week and it is nice because i can focus on cooking other dishes or even leave the kitchen when things are cooking in the oven and not need to watch the rice my only two complaints would be that the rice spoon wont fit inside for storage so it ends up separated and buried in the utensil drawer but that is pretty minor however the price point feels a little high for this but not ridiculous high assuming the enamel holds up the pot is better than some of the cheaper versionsmakes rice cooking fool proof"
17560,4,"bought this on a whim it does make great rice with no effort  just add the rice and water set the type and walk away til its finished for that it gets  starsthe value proposition is another story this thing is ridiculously expensive for what it does  it doesnt have the ability to use or add a steamer basket or do some of the other secondary tasks that make it more versatile for cooking a full meal in it even the zojirushi published recipes arent tailored for this machine which introduces a learning curve beyond just making plain ricemakes good rice"
9943,4,easy to use better than i thoughteasy to use
17722,5,trust me when i say once you can get over the its so expensive for just a rice cooker and just buy the device youll love every minute of it one getting to jam out to twinkle twinkle little star everytime you cook some rice is great two once you get the device youll be able to taste the real difference between your cheap little  aroma brand cooker to this god tier zojirushi also you can make some banger pancakes so just hit the button and buy a real rice cookerstop thinking you dont need it you do
11763,5,"ive had a well known more expensive brand rice cooker for over  years when the battery died and couldnt be replaced i went searching for another rice cooker i was planning on getting the same brand i had but started out checking some features on the other rice cookers there were so many to choose from but after reading reviews and watching some youtube videos i settled on this cooker it was half the price of my old brand and had extra features that i loveive used the timer function and the oatmeal setting to make overnight steel cut oats i just set them to finish cooking right when we woke up they were cooked perfectlymy white rice came out light and fluffy and cooked every bit as good as my more expensive rice cookerthe feature that i really love is the ability to saute something and then start the rice i like to sometimes use ginger and garlic in my rice and with this cooker i can saute it and then add the rice and water and cook being able to saute the aromatics first really is what sold me on the cookerthere are several other features like yogurt and steam that i havent tried yetalso the inside pan is heavier and feels more sturdy than my other rice cookervery pleasedlove this rice cooker"
12450,5,i wanted a rice cooker that us easy to clean my last one was very difficult to clean this one us so simple i love it it cools the rice perfectly i id remove the gadget under the lid that was for hanging the lid off the cookers handle that seemed problematic to keep completely clean i do not want to hang y lid so i didnt need itexcellent
8787,1,cant tell if the camera or the film is the issue with how the pictures turn out wouldnt recommend this one i bought the camera and a lot of film and couldnt use any of it because of how the pictures turn outcamera is great but the film is horrible or maybe it is the camera
812,1,only holds one picture at a timecamera
472,1,received this camera today as an amazon refurbish touting no defects im really disappointed the camera just didnt work it would occasionally turn on but for the most part was just dead i was able to take a total of  pictures before it just powered down randomly or while pressing the shutter button and then it wouldnt turn back on on the rare occurance it did turn on the lens was stuck or having difficulty adjusting and the display had those awful horizontal lines you see on old tube televisions long story short i called customer support and they offered a replacement then the representative retracted the offer due to a computer issue and offered a refund due to yet another issue she couldnt process the refund so she offered an amazon gift card which of course rendered the extended warranty i purchased worthless i found the same camera for a much lower price so now i have  the difference in prices sitting in an amazon gift card that is totally worthless overall im out  just for using amazon to buy my daughter a birthday gift i am beyond disappointed and thoroughly disgustedbeyond disappointed and disgusted
5423,1,does not down load picture into computer 
2274,1,after a month of minimum usage the camera shut it self down after few photo takentried to replace new aa batteries but camera still did not work properlythis is not good quality camera from kodakwe will need to return this cameracamera is broken after a month
5741,1,maybe i read it wrong but i bought these thinking they would work in my pogo polaroid printer but they dont they dont feed properly and half come out blank i was very disappointed not mention out the moneynot compatible
379,1,it should be illegal to advertise this camera by fooling people into believing they buy this great piece of contemporary technology when in reality its a camera for kids based on technology that delivers worse results than a  camera phonefact  this camera does not have a  optical zoom it zooms digitally meaning the more you zoom in the more pixelated the picture will lookfact  the  megapixels are a blatant lie its probably a digital  zoom of a  megapixel picture there is no way this camera has a  megapixel sensor this is a lawsuit case for false advertisingthat being said probably an okay camera for your kids or if youre into lofi quality if you find it for  false advertising
5148,1,says  and it is nowhere near dont waste your moneydont buy waste of money

2222,2,i had great hopes for this photobooth what with all the great reviews received it yesterday and as soon as i plugged it in and saw the dim led lighting i knew this thing was not gonna work for us in my opinion it needs double the led lighting im not in the mood to diy hack additional lighting even though i can if i wanted to so unfortunately this one will be going back oh wellvery underwhelming illumination too dim 
7025,1,after using this product there are scratches on my sensor they were not there beforescratched my sensor
13286,1,this is the only way to cook rice i have a hawaiian family so rice is a staple after about  years our smaller rice cooker broke so we ordered this one the first time using it the inner valve failed and left water all over the top soooooo messy when we went to put rice on our plates the rice was still so mushy because of the valve failure water then spilled all over our counter because so much water spewed out of the top taking the rice out of the cooker it was so light and not very sturdy the next time we used it we forgot to fix the valve before cooking and the same thing happened tonight i made sure the valve was sitting properly before cooking it and yet again my entire counter is a mess and m rice is mushy not worth the  whatsoevercheaply made rice cooker
14898,4,its a bit smaller than i had anticipated also you have to use the cup measure that comes with it which is actually not a cup and so if i lose that measure it will be a problemgood little rice cooker
1793,1,this camera had the highest amount of the highest ratings i was about to buy another camera but the ratings made this one win however i have had so many problems with this camera no matter how many youtube videos i watch or how hard my students who have this camera try it wont work all it does is flash endlessly when i try to take a picture the random and rare moment a picture is taken the photo is blurry is this the quality or a defective camerabest reviews worst camera
7307,1,the camera stopped working after seven months because it is a discontinued product gopro cannot replace it amazon will not do anything either because it is past the return date even though it is still under warranty feeling very frustratedterrible
5618,2,i thought this was going to be good but the picturevideo quality is bad and the audio is even worse dont buynot great
11362,5,ive had this for a couple months now and its one of my most frequently used kitchen items its just the right size for my tiny kitchen and cooks just the right amount of rice to go with my breakfast or dinner cleaning it is a breeze as well as the nonstick surface is a total dreamgreat for small spaces and cute
14863,5,it looks like the twin brother of the one i had for  years and i hope to get the same service from its twin easy to use makes perfect rice and its cheaper than the rest what more could i wantmy last one of this model died after  years
3967,2,i do not recommend buying this product we got it for my daughter and it works every other photovery disappointed
11011,5,so easy i only use one scoop cup of rice and just leave it  then it gets done automatically so nice tastes good and simple to get rice done and easy to clean so nicevery convenient i love it for one person house i recommend
190,1,great upgrade to the  except they crippled the flash shoe by removing the universal hotshoe pin pin non iso compliant it will not work with non canon flash or manual triggers canon and amazon tech were unable to provide a solution to fire remote flashes except for optical trigger which doesnt work when the camera body is enclosed in a photo booth head and the build in flash cannot be used canon said this is a stripped down version and doesnt expect the user to require remote flash other than that this is a great low cost entry level dslr cameraflash hotshoe crippled  only works with canon flash
3870,1,extremely disapointed with this camerai received it assembled and when i turned it on the message please turn camera off then on again in a portuguese version as i was painfully able to set the language started to pop out multiple timeshow can a brand new product have such problem where are the panasonic quality assurance procedures i searched the internet for a fix and found multiple similar complaints including a great youtube video of a guy that tried everything to make it work but it doesnt i gave up and decided to return the product not sure i can call it a productincluding a great youtube video of a guy that tried everything to 
9845,5,this rice cooker has multiple functions it steams vegetables within  minutes i always do a second batch so i have leftovers it also has a capability of a small crockpot i cant wait to try thatnot just a rice cooker
6270,1,does not workwill return battery does not charge
12992,5,this rice cooker was so easy to use the old one i had always burnt the bottom of the rice but this one is higher end and cooked it perfectly the rice pot itself is clearly marked with measuring levels for water and rice the inserts are easy to remove and clean up very well with just warm soapy water the instructions are simple to understand the electronic control panel is well lit and easy to understand no more guess work if your rice is going to be cooked to your liking this is the perfect small appliance for your space if you want to upgrade your current rice cookersteamer i would recommend this one for surei love it
1918,1,camera did not work we had a very disappointed  old on christmas daycamera did not work christmas disaster
6537,1,the light shuts off on its own it shuts off in the middle of long conference calls its very upsetting the back of the light near the charging port the case is very hot i have it constantly plugged in so i assume it has an overtemp shut downdont buy for continuous use
13264,1,rice cooker itself looks nice but not able to use due to missing the following items power cord spatula measuring cup manual warranty and steam tray packaged nicely with no damagemissing items
1331,1,it will not work at all it is a piece of junk dont waste your money i will be getting a kodakdoes not work
261,1,i really wanted this camera i was so excited when i got it just to receive a defective one as soon as i took it out the box and turn it on i kept getting a ois error and to restart the camera did all of that and looked at some youtube videos bc i didnt want to return it but nothing worked it just annoyingreceived it defective
10448,5,love the rice cooker its easy to usegreat rice cooker
16785,2,i use my rice cooker to make rice a few times each month and to make oatmeal practically every day i generally make the oatmeal using traditional old fashioned rolled oats and i only make enough for one serving which is about  cup of uncooked oats my old rice cooker a brand that started with a z worked great for both of these tasks for  years until it broke the handle latch instead of having it repaired i decided that the cookers with fuzzy logic must all be similar so i purchased this one in the  cup version i usually make jasmine rice and so far it has tended to be on the dry and hard side despite following the instructions exactly im sure in time ill get it adjusted to be right the oatmeal however has been a great disappointment my old machine made delicious creamy oatmeal though once in a while it would spill over and make a mess i never could figure out why that happened when it did this cuckoo machine has belched out a gloppy mess through the vent every single time ive tried adjusting all settings including cooking time warming temp ratios of oatmealwater rinsing longer etc all to no avail i switched to steel cut oats and it no longer spills over so im hopeful that ill get a good end result eventually but i prefer the traditional oats i also prefer to put them in the night before on timer so they are ready in the morning this process was much easier on the old machine id set it and it stayed set this one requires resetting of the timer duration each night in general this machine probably offers more user adjustable functions but the old one was simpler and just plain worked better im quite disappointed the manual is also very poorly writtenthere are better choices
2882,1,battery already out and my son hasnt worn it oncehorrible battery doesnt work
13806,5,i use this rice cooker every week not too expensive highly recommendedgreat rice cooker
9922,5,purchased it with doubt of why not just do the cooking myself i then fell in love with it i cook my rice and can forget about it bc of the heat feature i had boil my eggs in minutes cleaning is so easy sometime once i shut the lid ill forget about the dried rice till a few days later and have to clean it  takes less than a minute to get the rice out and it cleanloved it
675,1,i purchased this camera for my first trip to costa rica the camera worked well for the first two days the picture quality was good and the zoom was great on day three the lens fell off since it is held on with three very flimsy tiny screws it could not be fixed i called multiple places to see if it could be fixed and it could not i had to replace it by traveling to san jose costa rica and purchasing a  camera when i returned to the usa it was too late to return the broken camerai would strongly encourage anyone purchasing a camera especially if it is for an important trip to try any other camera i would not wish this experience on anyone elsedont buy this camera
14742,5,love this rice cooker there are different settings for many different types of rice and cooker can also be adjusted based on your preferences you can get as specific as you want to the timer is wonderful and the cooker remembers my favorite settings so its easy to use you can simply push the selection button and start or you can choose from its many settings and the rice came out perfectly the first time it also automatically keeps the rice warm when its done on top of all this the nonstick bowl just lifts out so its easy to clean love love love this rice cooker its everything i wanted and more highly recommendperfect rice the first time
10275,5,"works great doesnt take to much roomcooks very wellperfect size"
10163,5,ive always had trouble cooking rice this little rice cooker has done several pots now and each perfectly done ive also you the steamer for several different vegetables and again did a great jobgreat little steamer rice cooker
10424,5,i had one when i lived at home for years then i moved out and had to finally buy my own a very easy and simple way to cook rice and then forget about it while you make the rest of dinner as someone who always forgets to cook rice or pay attention to it this thing is amazing use the included cup to add rice fill up to the predetermined water level based on number of cups press start and forget it also comes with a decent warranty and some great recipes with more on their website that can be filtered to your productso simple
6977,1,while i love the film and the pictures this camera produces its very inconsistent and sometimes will pop out the picture and work and more often then not it doesnt i feel like ive wasted so much money on film thinking that was the potential problem and replacing the cartridge before it ran out its just really disappointing ive owned some form of these instax fujifilm cameras for the past  years and was really hoping that this one was new and improved sadly this one has been the moodiest of all the offenders and the most disappointing i wanted to return it but it is past the  day mark frustrated and annoyed after spending so much money on these instax fujifilm cameras the past few yearsconsistently inconsistent
17534,4,"it worked well in the past  years all of a sudden the rice gets spoiled after  hoursafter replacing inner lid set the above issue was solved so i just changed my rating from  to  spoiled"
17546,5,i use this machine at least once a week and its great i work from home and when i get to the end of the work day im normally too impatient to cook rice on the stove i start my brown rice at about  and by  i have perfect brown rice and dont have to worry about getting distracted by an email or meeting at work i have used it for white mixedwild and brown rice and the rice comes out perfect every time its super reliable and accurate the rice tastes so much better from this machine than it does on the stove also zojurishi makes the best small appliances which is why i splurged on this ive had their bread machine for  years and it still works as well as it did brand new i dont regret spending a little more when i know things will lastgreat machine for people who eat a lot of rice
15427,4,the reason i say this cooker is good for a first is because the pot is metal this might not seem like a big deal but it can make a difference for one thing stone pots dont burn food quite the same way as metal would because with a stone pot you can still eat burnt rice now dont get me wrong a metal pot can be great for cooling food down quicker but itll be easier to scratch if you use any tool material other than wood or plastic which means you will either be buying a replacement pot or a whole new unit after a few years so if you are or know a college student or a single person with little inclination to cook this rice cooker will work just fine however if you have had a rice cooker in the past then feel free to bypass this one just spend the extra money for a cooker with a stone potits good if its your first
14480,4,item was delivered on time but it was smaller than expected the maximum it holds to make room for steaming is two cups and even then the rice will swell up into the steam basket everything was included which makes it convenient but i wish it would make  cups of rice at least beautiful packaging but buy the biggest size of you cook for more than yourselfsmaller than expected
10104,4,quick dontpayattention cooking great for prepping the rest of the meal for a stirfry it cleans up pretty easily except it spews some starch up in between the cover and the inside the pot ive been cleaning it with a dish cloth i hope it doesnt get clogged up occasionally when i only cook one cup itll spew out the top funny but when i do  cups it doesnt come out of the top but it does need a wiping down on the inside of he cover just hope it doesnt clog the inbetween like it a lot for stirfryingwhen i cook  cup it tends to spew a bit but not as bad as others
16003,5,"lovethis productuse almost daily "

17046,5,great deal and you can use the dutch oven in your oven awesome multi usegreat
13708,5,"i bought the basic smallest rice cooker listed here after my old rival rice cooker died that one had been a gift and lasted for over  years so i was pretty satisfied with it and probably would have bought the same one if i could have found it but i didnt i ended up choosing this one despite being more expensive than other basic rice cookers because i have been very satisfied with other zojirushi products primarily the thermoses and carafeswow i was blown awayi expected it to be pretty much the same as the old rival one i had since i was getting the basic version and the smallest size but there is so much more detail put into this one the bowl where you put the rice is much more solid and hefty and the finish is smooth and obviously durable though ive only used it a few times compared to the one i had before the cord is quite long which was surprising as well but very convenient it also did come with the advertised accessories though i didnt need them i measure my own ricequinoaetc with regular measuring cups and i have the old paddle still from the rival rice cooker i say this because i saw another reviewer mention that they did not receive the accessories on the basic modelso far i have cooked quinoa with turmeric and garam masala something i eat regularly for breakfast and wild rice in this new rice cooker no problems no liquid mess spouting out the tiny hole on the lid no grains sticking to the bottom of the bowl  in fact it all slides out so fast and easy that one would expect the whole thing to be lined in oil this also makes it a breeze to clean  with nothing stuck to the bottom you can easily remove all the grains into a container or plate so that the bowl is completely empty it also can go in the dishwasher as could the old rival with no issuesoverall this feels more like a luxury sports model compared to the rival i had before despite getting the basic model maybe there arent as many bells and whistles as the higherlevel options but there is no skimping in quality or functionality definitely worth the extra money compared to other basic rice cookers and much better than i was expectingbasic model far from basic"
13468,5,this is probably the best gadget next to my airfryer oven it cooks just the right amount of rice for  people everytime with ease of cleaning love itwhere have you been
10051,5,i love how small this rice cooker is yet it makes amazing white and brown rice its also quite affordable  definitely recommendaffordable doesnt take lots of counter space works great
15339,4,i really enjoy this cooker however mine is defective can only perform on the digital program settings however i use it for lots of homemade soups and greens cabbage meals so it dose the job this is my second one last one was good for three years it just stopped anyway i like this cooker because i can set it and forget it which i need in a busy toddler running home so i give it  starscant change temperature settings
12296,5,this cooker is a dream super easy controls a solid base with a retractable power cord and a breeze to clean i feel silly for not buying this sooner i dont know much about communicating with customer service but the website is easy enough to navigatei finally have the rice cooker holy grail
13655,5,"first wash the rice we measure out  to  cups depending on what we want and put it in a wire strainer rinse under cold water for about a minute moving the rice with our fingers the clearer the runoff water the better but it does not have to be crystal clear put the washed rice and the correct amount of water per instructions turn on and walk awaysecond there may be a small amount of liquid around the vent hole but it should never seem like it boiled over if there is a lot of liquid then you need to wash the rice longerthird we do not recommend boil in bag rice you can use it but even washed it spat out more liquid from the vent not over the edge but close enough to not recommend boil in bag ricelast we have used jasmine and white rice plus the one time experiment with boil in bag white rice we love the rice and normally use jasmine cook rice about once a week no scorching of the pan we hand was our pan and lid they are small so quick and easy  cup does not have warmer but if you unplug and leave the rice in the pan it will stay warm long enough for a mealfor  cup version  wash the rice"

1926,1,very disappointedthis product takes one picture then i have to change film
1161,1,the pictures quality are terrible video recording audio is even worse definitely a waste of money i will be returning this productworse camera
1868,2,unfortunately i have to give this a low rating because it stopped taking pictures bought it for an old school birthday party it made it through  packs of film then just stopped working we refreshed the batteries put new film packs in even let it sit for  mins thinking it overheated but nothing helped it quit on us we pushed the button and no picture thank goodness we had our trusty cell phones to capture the memoriesstopped taking picstures

17390,5,"im an asian american who has grown up eating rice as the primary starch for almost every meal picture rice with spaghetti or as a side dish to ramen i thought i knew what good rice was and had a hard time justifying a rice cooker that cost more that boy was i wrong this rice cooker has been life changing the cook time is longer than the lesser cookers ive owned  mins vs  but its worth the wait the timer function lets you set what time your rice will be ready instead of when it starts cooking this is genius and means ill have a fresh steaming pot of rice at dinner with a little planning extra bonus points gone are the days of waiting for the rice cooker click off and rushing over to turn it back for the second click cook  in fact your rice will be ready to fluff and serve immediately after the finish jinglemy rice is now consistently perfect and has turned me into a total rice snob ive begun buying better rice to make use of this cookers abilities but readily available calrose rice comes out fluffier and more aromatic i hope to one day upgrade to the pressure  induction version zojirushi i will gladly write an unbiased review if you send me one but this is the perfect rice cooker for me highly recommendedperfect rice is worth every penny"

648,2,i was hoping for a camera that i couldnt mess up and wouldnt be upset about losingbreaking however i still wanted a camera that worked as advertised this camera is far from  and id be lucky if i could catch a photo when i actually wanted to take one the camera takes forever to focus and if it does its only focused for a half second taking a photo takes way longer than it should causing people to stand frozen while i say hold on hold on one second loses the magic of the moment and i become more frustrated and embarrassed than anythingthe camera overall gave the impression of a toy camera which i wouldve been fine with if it worked a majority of the time feels like a waste of  and i wish i had just bit the bullet on a brand namewas looking for a beginner camera but now im thinking i underestimated myself
5694,1,every  of photo paper has its own color calibration card the first  out of  i tried all the photos came out slightly pink it looks terrible searching for an answer on the internet i came across the theory that it might be some bad calibration cards but i tried an old calibration card i had saved from previous photo paper packs and it didnt make a difference so i opened a new  still pink of course since i am not trying to be a photo sticker printer expert i let time pass between troubleshooting episodes and now too much time has gone by to return this box of sticker paper i would say just buy one  or  at a time so you can request a refund within the return windowdefective color calibration pictures turn out pink

12990,5,"this is a great rice cooker it is almost an insta pot it does so much that i dont even know why they call it a ric cooker lolit has so many features that you can cook different kinds of rice oatmeal grains and regular meals it also comes with a recipe book with has  recipes it is big but so is the insta pot but this can do so much more than just rice and it is deffinately worth itmore than a rice cooker"

8740,2,what is that piece of junk the extremely expensive film doesnt turn out its dark and dim and substantially worse than polaroid from  years ago the polaroids were better then my son likes it and thinks thats how the film should look but you can barely see anything flash or notdark

3459,2,we wanted to use this for a picture booth i set up at my teens birthday a couple days ago before the party started we shot a few practice shots to make sure everything was good to go we followed the directions and tried different backgrounds and lighting situations but the photo quality was so bad that we decided just to do phone photos i initiated a return on this item this morningalso annoying this camera requires a micro usb to charge but does not come with a cord fortunately one of my kids still had a micro usb from their old phone that we could useterrible print quality
5008,2,my  year old daughter bought this with her christmas and birthday money saved up for months the photo quality is mediocre at best and instax made a huge mistake getting rid of the exposure settings on the model  without it or at least a flash you can turn off if youre in even a moderately bright room or closer than  feet to a person the photos turn out anywhere from super over exposed to completely white she still gets a kick out of it and she loves the accessories but the camera is a massive disappointmentmediocre
17568,5,"id heard the brand name zojirushi for a long time but never thought to spend the money on it until recently when i got sick of eating precooked rice from a bag i thought id eventually save the cost of a good rice cooker if i bought one i thought would lasti dont know if it will last but im following all the instructions for cleaning and maintenancebut so far all the rice ive cooked has come out so much better than any i have ever cooked before buying ive only cooked long grain white jasmine and brown rice i have a small kitchen so i cant have dozens of containers of rice on hand i didnt think brown rice would come out so fluffy and deliciousim glad i bought my model of zojirushi rice cookeri never cooked rice so well"
4484,1,i had high hopes for this kit it did help very little but i dont recommend cleaning it on your own im gonna save money and buy me a brand new camera instead of sending it isdont use
830,1,i needed a basic camera for a trip it didnt have to be perfectunfortunately when i tried to charge it nothing happened i used the cord it came with and tried multiple othersit came with some charge so i took some pics with it and the quality and ease of use were fine but the casing feel like cheap plastic so it doesnt feel like a quality piecenever was able to charge this waste of money
8865,1,the settings are impossible very frustrating to use i hate this cameraglitchy and difficult to use
7758,1,my  year old bought this camera with her own money worked a handful of times then broke so flimsy for a kids cameradont waist your money

2346,1,camara stop printing kid bummed out i would not add a star to this  day using after leaving to charge
6192,2,it was a pretty heavy fabric the drawstring that goes around the front of the lens doesnt allow the auto focus to work very well and its difficult to zoom in and outreturned ended up getting the clear plastic kind that attaches to the camera by removing eye piece put the bag on and reattch the eye piececumbersum

5007,1,my camera just doesnt work  tried new batteries and nothing  really disappointed as i live in the caribbean and would be difficult to return this only gave this  star because theres not an option to put zero starsdisappointed
12142,5,my poor bank account was hurting the day after i bought this rice cooker however it was one of the best investments ive ever made i constantly eat rice and this just makes it more convenient clean up is no hassle and it has a timer function which lets you put it a portion of uncooked rice and have it because for a later time so you could basically wake up to fresh be made rice also perfectly cooked same consistency throughout every grain every time side note ive also started to eat more vegetables because of this steam basket that comes with the rice cookerslperge its worth it
4318,1,i ordered this for my canon  i have a zoom lens that i carry as well as a  mm i carry memory cards and extra batteries so nothing super strenuous for the bag almost immediately after receiving the bag i noticed the the seams starting to shread not tear we could sew the tears but the nylon was coming apart i liked the size of this bag as i could grab it in a hurry and just fling it over my shoulder i shoot a lot of wildlife and outdoorsy stuff so it was nice for that but soon after the first tear showed up more and more began to form this time they were not near the seams i thought this bag would be very durable but sadly it was not definitely will not be ordering one of these againwould not buy again
7837,2,this is my first time trying it im not very happy the first  pictures are very bad the last one i had to edit it that way so that the full picture could came out i dont understand somebody can explain me if theres a tip that can help me so that the full photo can came out normal and not editing it that waynot very satisfied need help please

5569,2,we just got this camera yesterday but my daughter has already gone through all  sheets of paper its very much like a polaroid but the paper is much smaller which is fine there is no digital anything it doesnt store anything you take a picture and it spits out the tiny paper with the image the biggest problem im having now is that the papers often have imperfections a dark thick line from the cartridge its contained in damaging it before its used thats a big problem the paper is very sensitiveits cute for a child

7104,1,dont deserve any stars quality of pictures are crap and the actual camera looks cheap not worth the money i sent it back 
2034,2,i expected the pictures to not be the greatest but they were worse than i expected and with the price of the film its hard to play around and figure out how to fix the problem the cheapest i could find film was  pictures for  picture quality
7154,1,it specifically says it comes with  sheets of film it did not they did not answer and of my calls and i will continue to call until they do i paid  for this and only got the printer no filmsno films
8860,1,see picture everything advertised as included on the side of the box wasnt in the box except for the camera body  items as you see from the picture thats really bad quality checking on whoever boxed itand whoever double checked of they do that like they shouldi contacted customer service they dont really seem to believe me and asked for a variety of pictures to investigate they emailed a manager to see if they could find the missing partswhich sounds pretty weird and like they have some sort of quality control issue if that could even be possible to mislay that many parts and ship the box outthey also requested i keep every scrap of packaging so dont throw even a wrapper out if you have missing stuff like meupdated the box had  itemsbad quality checking on their part
13542,4,i cook white or brown rice it takes  minutes for white rice i think it should take  minutes the brown rice takes longer and comes out a bit over cooked crusty on the top and i only cook one cup at a time not thrilled with this cookerseems to take forever
16199,5,"ive been on the market for a rice cooker for s while now and was pleasantly surprised to find so many positive reviews on this one i eat a lot of rice so i needed something that could withstand regular use im pleased to say that this rice cooker passes the testa lot of the reviews mentioned it being smaller than expected however i feel like many people didnt fully understand the measurements listed as pictured this rice cooker is quite small however as someone who lives in a small apartment with limited counter space this rice cooker is the perfect size its also incredibly easy to use the standard instructions are easy to follow though ive made enough rice that i dont need them this rice cooker is practically foolproof and the end result is fluffy delicious rice that anyone can make if youre on the fence about it dont be its a seriously good rice cooker and for the price you cant possibly beat itperfect for apartment living"
2785,1,camera hasnt worked since it was received changed batteries and tried new film and button wont press to take a photo would like to return asapcamera doesnt work

9076,2,love the golden frame but the pictures came out way too dark or completely dark not showing anybody ive just wasted an entire film without a single good picture very disappointedbad picture quality
7036,2,left streaks on my  swabs did not fully cover apsc sensorbad with 
147,1,i think the price is so high i hope i will get low pricehigh price
8970,1,we ordered this camera for our daughter for christmas not through this vendor it never turned on she charged it fully but it would die as soon as she took it off of the charger i kept calling the minolta customer service number and have repeatedly been sent to voicemail the other vendor hsn defaulted to go figure calling that number for relief i put it in a box wrapped it in duct tape and wrote return because minolta is crap all over it before sending it back im out  and the camera but lets be honesti was out the camera already so at least i feel better save yourself and dont get this cameras have defects but this issue is a customer service issue they dont carenightmare with  loss
14044,4,we love rice but i always managed to boil it all over the stove this sure eliminates that and the rice is perfectly cookedim glad i got a rice cooker
6248,2,i am not sure if i am using it incorrectly or what but i found this item to be very restrictive when used on my canon rebel xs the part that fits over the lens does not work well on my  sigma lens it keeps slipping off the lens when i extend the zoom on the lens it is made of ok quality material but i did not care for how it functions with my camerai am not sure if i am using it incorrectly 
11438,5,cooks all sorts of carbs very good buttons one of the power button needs work but beside that pretty goodamazing pink tool
9030,2,scroll down for updateim gonna start with the good and trickle in the less good but this camera is close to perfect for what i do given whats available anywaysi sold my olympus  mk ii and   for this kit and some cash i knew the video would be better and raw images would be nearly the same but i didnt expect it to be so much better to usethe autofocus is basically instant though it does seem to confirm auto focus when its not in focus more than my olympus cameras did the tracking and continuous autofocus is lightyears better though in that it actually works combined with the generous buffer about  raws its a decent camera for casual action dogs kids etc pinpoint autofocus is great for macro work or any time focus is really critical using that you usually wont need to manual focusvideo autofocus is a bit of a different matter it tends to hunt a fair bit and it can be pretty slow to lock on focus i might just not be using it right but i tend to manual focus video for that  photo mode is brilliant the images are only  megapixels but thats plenty for most things the implementation is what makes it great it basically shoots a video using your photo settings and you can extract the frame you want from it the only knock on it is that its only jpeg and since the camera does decent burst shooting anyways its sometimes a tossup if you even need it but the option to record a couple seconds before you hit the shutter is awesome post focus has come in handy way more than i ever thought it would the in camera focus stacking can have some weird artifacts and stitching errors thoughthe screen is awesome its totally usable in bright sunlight not just usable totally usable the evf however isnt very good its totally usable in fact when im using it to frame i dont notice that its sorta crummy but its small the colors are weird theres some adjustment in the menu that helps a lot and the optics make it kind of blurry around the edges again though i stopped noticing pretty quick it should be better it isnt great in the sun though usually evfs are better for bright sun this camera is different the screen is just better in the sunlightthe touchscreen implementation and menus and everything are very good the q menu is nice one problem is that things in the menu change or get greyed out based on other settings with no way to tell what you have to do to change them the ihdr and ihandheld night shot modes is only available in iauto which is fine but it still shows up greyed out in the menu and hdr is greyed out if youre shooting raw which again fine but maybe either switch to jpeg if i select it or indicate what needs to be changed similarly panorama settings show up greyed out if youre not in panorama mode also settings for screen brightnesscoloretc change to evf settings if the camera is up to your eye which actually works because it helps you match the two but its weird at first another strange choice is that you can change the burst rate in the q menu but you cant switch back to single shot and the setting doesnt show up if you arent in burst mode you have to use a button to set burst mode then the q menu to change the af type it just seems like a weird choice anyways that was likely more information than needed but these cameras get a lot of praise for their menus and i think some of the weirdness gets glossed over once you get past a couple little quirks though it is very intuitivethe buttonsdials and everything are well spaced and laid out it has enough function buttons for me the location of the aeaf lock button makes for great backbutton focusing the onoff switch is in a nice place for onehanded use but i do seem to move the mode dial when i use it sometimes i bet they could have added some degree of separation and kept the layout basically the same and fixed thatimage quality finally its fine its what you expect from micro  a bit less dynamic range a bit more noise than apsc cameras but some of the other features make up for it usually the lenses are a bit smaller especially telephoto the lenses are sharper and more plentiful than say sonys apsc selection i find i can shoot up to iso  and be pretty happy higher if its just for instagram or something dynamic range is fine but you do have to be careful not to blow out highlights sometimes the camera seems to meter a bit bright sometimes so you do have to watch thatthe jpegs are good the colors can have a bit of a greenish tint to them but theres a lot of contrast and punch even in the natural mode olympus gets a lot of praise of their jpeg rendering and i always liked it but ive been liking the results of this camera a bit better it doesnt ruin reds like olympus tends to and the files seem easier to edit i would recommend turning the noise reduction down thoughvideo is fantastic its sharp has good colors i have no complaints that dont also apply to the stills noise and dynamic range although i really feel like these cameras should shoot iso  or lower it would be especially nice for video to keep shutter speeds low but for stills as well a little more dynamic range and less noise for still lifelandscape stuff but theyre working with the sensors they got i guessbuild quality is fine its plastic but its good plastic the dials are nice and clicky the buttons feel good its good people would probably go nuts over the build quality if they just covered it in a thin metal layer but that usually just means it scratches easier and dents im of the opinion that if its not a real chunk of metal it should be plastic and this camera is just that and its fineconclusion its great but theres always room for improvementedit i forgot a couple of thingsthe image stabilization is great its not quite as good as the best olympus stuff but its close with dual is it can be a bit jumpy with video but its still pretty good i havent really adjusted my technique from the olympus gearthe  kit lens is fantastic the aperture is the same slow aperture as most kit lenses and it doesnt have as much zoom range as normal but its tiny focuses quickly and most importantly the image quality is great it really looks about the same as the pro zooms as long as you dont need the faster aperture but if you just dont like zooms or prefer faster zooms its super easy to sellthe hot shoe seems tight i dont know what thats about but my godox flashes are a bit hard to put on and take offupdate  camera broke the sensor started acted up i sent it in for a warranty repair and was told it was abused worse the quoted price was more than i paid new worse still the pictures they sent me showed my camera in worse condition than i sent it in it did have some scrapes and scuffs but its a plastic camera blink wrong and it gets a scratch but they showed it with one of the plastic joints on the front loose which was not the case when i sent it in they claimed they needed to replace the sensor but i suspect its actually just a loose connector the problem was intermittent there was also an extra  for screws which whatplus it took over a week to hear anything from themso i dig the camera and have preferred panasonic for a long time but im done with panasonic at least for a whilei like it more than i expected and i expected to love it then it broke
14795,5,we needed a new rice cooker to replace our old one and have not regretted our choice to purchase this it may not sing like our old cooker but it does everything else we need it to very well clean up and maintenance is simple delivery arrived on time well packaged very pleased thank youperfect rice every time  
6478,2,the quality of the build is good i like the light itselfafter a couple of months of pretty standard use it just started blinking and being all wonky its fairly cold in my office and it doesnt feel like it has overheated battery wont hold a charge and even plugged in it wont consistently stay litoh well do not buyfrustrating because i really wanted to like this light
12938,4,this cooker has so many options and recipes you can make i cant seem to get my rice to cook correctly but i think it is user error ill eventually get it right it is a little confusing to use but i love the way it looks and how it is so easy to cleannice
16213,5,purchase with confidence this is a good product good purchase
2500,1,from day one it did not work right i will try to take a picture and it will sometimes work the first time sometimes never and sometimes in between in the process i lost many films when i tried to look to contact fuji it is a nightmare to reach someonei am very disappointed at this itemvery disappointed
6590,1,i purchased this product as a used refurbished camera it does not work it will allow you to take about a dozen photos then everything stops working it does not change from telephoto to wide angle it sticks you can take a photo you cant turn it off when it is stuck the only way to get operational is to open the battery door then you can take maybe three or four photos before it sticks again i am so sorry i wasted any money on this useless camera i have had and worn out several other cool pix camera and loved them i should have returned the camera when it was first not working but i did not my fault i will never purchase a refurbished product from amazon again since it seems there is no quality control or oversight thought you should knowbroken refurbished cool pic camera that does not work
3654,1,the camera works fine but the case is the wrong way  the camera will not go inside as you can see in the picture its impossiblethe case does not fit the camera so its no good
8687,1,i would not recommend this didnt work out of the box but realized it too late to return waste of  out of the box
10529,4,saves time and efficient but the measuring cup is not accurate and sometimes it may overlook the rice so just watch itsaves time
8784,2,was so excited for this product but the pictures are awful ive tested in different lighting indooroutdoor flash etc and you can hardly tell whats in the picture definitely not worth the price and there are much better products out therehorrible quality pics
13512,5,ive bought this exact same thing a few times over the past  years each time i do i first buy a couple of fancier rice cookers that promise better rice and more features and etc etc and every single time i use them a little find that i dont need all those other features and that none of them cooks rice as well as this simple classic it just cant be beat zojirushi has mastered the rice cooker and this is the one you wanti keep trying fancier ones and coming back to this model
12723,5,its so easy to use with a touch of a button to cook any grain or rice i use it to cook white rice brown rice quinoa and steamed vegetables there are so many functions that i havent tried yet such as oatmeal and other grains its so easy to use that i havent had the chance to read the manual for more functions i would highly recommend for a rice cookeramazing quick rice cook and more
5615,2,the sound is awful you will need a separate microphone if using to make vlogsbad sound
16965,5,"wow just wow i got it today and ran a test cook wow just wow braising has always been one of my favorite cooking methods i have a ceramic coated iron dutch oven not a le creuset they are very nice but over pricedat the moment i dont have access to an oven ive had and used an instant pot for a while now when i first got the pressure cooker i wasnt that impressed it is useful and i use it often but it is also extremely over hyped so when this came out i was skeptical between the price at launch and my previous experience with the pressure cooker i wasnt ready to pull the trigger but remained intrigued now that the price is reasonable i got oneso tonight i did a test run with pork ribs they came out magnificent the meat is tender and browned all the way around the braising liquid evaporated a little just like it does in an iron dutch oven in an oven concentrating along with the melted fat into a really really good sauce i used the same recipe that i have used hundreds of times in the past the finished product came out the same as it does in an oven this is a device i will be using oftensome reviewers expressed concern over the rim rusting for anyone with out experience with dutch ovens the rim is not glazed to avoid chipping to avoid rust just take a paper towel and rub some cooking oil onto the exposed iron after washing before putting it away to avoid chipping use a piece of flexible plastic the kind used as cheap table cloths or shelf liner put a piece between the cover and body of the pot while in storageimpressive"
15088,4,"as someone who previously owned a hamilton beach rice cooker i have to say i loved it for its ability to not only cook rice but also steam vegetables and hardboil eggs i cant imagine doing any of those things now so when i needed to replace my veteran rice cooker and saw this item i decided to give it a shotso let me say functionally it works very well the rice i have cooked with it and the versatility of its operation is truly awesomehowever the instruction manual may as well have been thrown out at the factory it does not explain the full functionality of the device much less the meaning of its interface iconographyallow me to explain further the first time i used this i cooked two cups of white rice i pressed the white rice button and walked away i checked on it a few times as it warmed up but all i got was this devices equivalent of a generic progress barlater i heard a beep when i returned there was a new icon lit up and a timer displayed i figured that the water was finally steaming and it was cooking however instead of counting down the counter was going up so i decided to see what the heck was going on and opened it up inside i found perfectly made rice fluffy and unburnt rice even at the edges of the cooking surface it was all perfectso i checked the manual to see what i failed to read and guess what the documentation doesnt explain the icons on its interface what they mean and even explain the cooking modes in any detail that is usefulsince then i have experimented further with this and the results are always great but using it always feels like guesswork as i suspect they never hired a translator to properly translate the full instruction manualso i am torn as to how many stats to give here on one hand instructions are kind of a basic expectation but that said the results i get and the ease of cleanup are so spectacular that i have to give it four stars it it came with a useful manual it would be an easy five starsgreat cooker awful instructions and interface"
753,1,after going through the package i can not find a memory card and im the device that slot is emptydid not receive a memory card
6862,1,not easy to use and came with very little instructions the battery charge is very poor with only about  minutes of use before needing to change batteriesbattery charge will only last but a few minutes for  hour use i charged battery twice
6045,1,the picture quality is bad the video quality is absolutely horrible when you try to play the video back on your computer its sped up and then picture freezes even though the play progress bar continues to move forward there was also no sound this is like a dollar store toy not even a cameranot worth  horrible video quality
498,1,i bought it as a gift and am very disappointed that it does not work am trying to return itdoes not work
8159,2,i was excited to get this only to be disappointed by the fact that the mic they sent me in the bundle would not work i contacted them and no response ive since returned the item and am awaiting my refund the quality of the video is ok  at  but what good is it if the camera wont record audio with the setup they sell the jack coming from the camera that the mic hooks into is a trrs jack while the mic they sent has a trs jack the back of the box states its a trs cable when in reality it is a trrs cable they sent i will not buy anything from this company againno audio with external mic
12010,5,this is the best rice cooker we have had so far multiple functions are good the design is sleek and nice easy to clean only down side is the time on the rice cooker isnt accurate as sometimes it shows  minutes while it would take  minutes over all i like it and n complaintsbeatiful
2520,1,i should have read the title of the camera but it is definitely a kids camera it does not work very welleh
8993,1,only received  of  filmonly received  of  film
11550,5,ive had it a few weeks and enjoyed using it for cooking rice and steamed veggies makes it easy to just put everything in there and let it cook ive also been making dried beans in it to store in  cup servings in the freezer for future use its so much cheaper than buying canned beans and we eat beans regularly i learned to set it to the pasta setting from another review and then i up the time to  minutes it worked well twice so far on  of beans but once it didnt work for one time through i had to do a second  min maybe it was user error though still learning but when it did work it was perfect beans i just added a little seasoning and the required water according to package i also made a special ricequinoaveggie mix all cooked together and it was pretty amazingbeen great for easy cooking
944,2,this is an awful excuse for a camera the lens is pathetic producing nothing but murky images the viewfinder is worthless even shooting outdoors in full sun the pictures lack clarity color or any sharpness yes i could have taken them into an image processor but the information on the jpegs isnt enough to really work with smeary and blurred pixels will always be the same this camera is worse than any phone camera stick to that or splurge for a little bit nicer camera your images will look a hundred times better than what you can get with this junkcant take a decent picture even in full sun
8514,1,bought this camera in may loved it great pics great battery life used it almost every day for four and a half months then it crapped out the shutter broke and and doesnt shut having spent a couple months with instax withdraw i actually came on here to buy a new one but the more i thought about it no thank you if i have to spend  plus a not so cheap brand new roll of film down the toilet every few months its just not cost effective no matter how much i loved the product i spent those four months with it on me pretty much every where i went encouraging people to buy one now im warning people away from itfun while it lasted didnt last long
14561,5,it is the perfect size for me im single and the rice i cook is enough for me i used it today the rice cooked quietly i was surprised so much faster than when i cook it stove top easy to clean im glad i bought this oneworks perfect
9856,5,i just love this rice cooker  it is easy useclear and it is very convenientyou must have this rice  cooker
1836,1,will never order again this was not for meagain not for me
6613,1,not worth the money i will be sending back no picture quality does not take sharp crisp pictures absolute let downmy phone takes better pictures
2568,1,battery lasts for  pictures then diesbattery life terrible
1693,1,i love the color and the whole idea that i was sold but it does not work thought it was a user error but others have tried to make it work and its just a decorative piece at this point not happywaste of money and im beyond not happy
7748,1,this product is awful not just as a camera but as any product in general the camera is slow to load the buttons feel cheap and the display screen is low resolution i feel the only way this camera has any positive reviews is if they were bought buyer bewarecheap not worth it
13067,5,love this cooker so many features excited to try oatmeal nextperfect rice
9717,5,oatmeal cream of wheat rice so far and even our first batches have come out near perfect priced right and easy to useabsolutely as advertised easy to use with stellar results
3345,1,didnt work froze after every picturetrash
6405,2,gave this two stars because it is a great value only if it had worked the camera cuts off after one or two seconds this was after charging it is useless to me any buyers need to aggressively learn to use the camera so you may test it prior to the short window for return i delayed in learning to use camera this week i tried to use it for the first time outdoors i have only had the camera  weeks i was willing to exchange but the return policy is restricted to only  weeks the instructions are extremely small print and even with wearing two sets of readers i found the instructions vague and incomplete the learning curb is by trial and error hence my delay in learning purchase at your own riskdied before use poor instructions one month return window
11417,5,so easy to make perfect rice just  rationot afraid to mess up rice anymore
15915,5,easy instructions and easy cleangreat rice cooker
11401,5,this cooker changed my life cook oatmeal with maple syrup dried fruit and nuts thank me laterlife changing
12597,4,"i was initially a little bit worried about the reviews that said that the rice cooker died within a couple weeks but we had just moved and i needed a cheap rice cooker asap this was cheap so we took the risk we bought the rice cooker back in february and now its july and still working great for reference we eat rice  or  times a week so its been heavily usedits not the most amazing rice cooker ive ever had if i cook anything but plain white rice eg if i add a can of tuna or some sort of sauce or cook brown rice the bottom tends to burn slightly but for us its no big deal its easy to wash i only use a wash cloth and the nonstick finish is still good as newfinal thing we bought the  cup uncooked rice  cups cooked to cook rice and use the steaming basket at the same time you should cook no more than  cups of uncooked rice in this model since we usually start with  cups uncooked it meant i could never cook rice and steam food at the same time if i had to do it again i would just go for the largest modelstill going strong at  months"
12695,2,i was excited about the price on this guy but unfortunately it came dented nothing serious at first so i decided to use it and see if it still worked the instructions are simple its basically a plug push and wait  i got up to the plug part the dent was located near the button that is pushed down to allow the food to cook therefore when pushed down it would not stay and spring back into the warm setting not what expected from a brand like black deckerwish i got to try it properly
3988,1,it came broken the lens was stuck in one position so the pictures are too dark to make out what it is i need to return it and hopefully the next one will work the accessories are pretty cute thoughidk
9687,5,this is the best way to make rice perfectfavorite rice cooker
10274,5,"we own a large  cup partysized aroma housewares rice cooker and love it so we decided to give this small  cup a trygrowing up in an area where white sticky rice is served on the daily you become a rice cooker connoisseur early on having owned pricey cookers and cheapy cookers of nearly all the popular sizes and makes ive learned that the only things that matter are  is your rice cooked firm and chewy  is it easy to clean and  does it cook enough to feed your family this pot met all these criteria for us as well as taking up very little counter space while looking good in steel  black at  glance we thought this is the teeniest pot weve ever owned but it really does cook  full cups of perfectly done rice  translucent and slightly sticky we dont eat fluffy softer rice like uncle benswe rinsed and drained completely  cups of raw rice rice measured to the cup brim and used a colander to drain then filled the pot with cool water to the  cup line in the pot doing so matched the thumb measuring rule lightly touching the top of the raw rice water should reach  digit we were pleased that the lines are clearly marked in white using the white rice setting the pot began its  minute count down after  minutes for a  total minute cook time there was no wait time after cooking was complete this review is based on the sams club members mark thai hom mali jasmine rice a long grain we have not tried our other favorite brand which is hinode calrose white rice a medium grain but i suspect it will need a bit more water probably filled to the  liter mark and will need at least a  minute wait for the rice to set before servingwe have not tried the warm setting for rice since we unplug the pot as soon as its done serve it then refrigerate whatever is left i will use the warm setting occasionally for broths i also plan to cook bulgar using more water than rice on the brown rice setting the delay setting works well for jasmine rice presoaking then cooking on flash rice probably wont use it for steaming but you never knowthis cooker serves  persons well fast and easy to clean with no sticking we also like the white speckled black pot  thats a first for us weve had the pot for a day and already tried two recipes very useful thus faralmost returned it  glad we didnt"
9928,5,for years i had a very difficult time making brown rice without it being off also steaming was always a little soggy or dry this thing is amazing simply measure out your water add your veggies in the basket tap a couple of buttons and everything it cooks comes out excellent brown rice is always cooked but not dry steamed vegetables and chicken are always yummy stews are never scorched soup is very yummy assuming you start out with good soup that is it has a timer to set for when i get home it keeps food warm after it cooks it without drying it out just amazing i love this thing best crock potsteamer ive ever hadshockingly effective and accurate
816,1,i did not realize it did not come with the sd card now i have to go buy one not happy what good is a camera if you cant take picturesbe aware sd card does not come with this camera
15086,5,very goodsafety and operation
13606,5,this is my third purchase of this exact model ive only had to get new ones because ive moved to other countries and could not take it with me ive loved this little cooker for at least  years could even be longer it never fails and is so easy well worth the extra dollarsbest little rice cooker ever
8127,1,no photos produced of clarity   left on  film  any ideas as we have taken your advice twice to no effect 
16771,4,this mostly works well it makes a great pot of rice a couple things that could better  the lid is very heavy and swings open with a fair amount of force but the opening button is difficult to push without bracing the cooker with another hand which means youve got no free hand to stop the lid from slamming open and into any nearby wall or cabinetdoes its job lid design is flawed
11748,4,"so im a big muppet when it comes to making anything in the kitchen usually all i end up making successfully is a messbut its devices like this that make everything so much easier its very simple to use with pads you press for whatever you want it to do today i made a perfect sticky white rice just add rice and equal parts water to the non stick bowl inside the rice maker and click startafter it has fully cooked you can choose to keep it warmreally nothing so far that i am not happy with maybe it could have had a lift up handle to lift the bowl out from the inside but i wont complain about that one thing i should mention is the instructions are awful if you dont know what you are doing then you will be on you tube pretty soon also there isnt any kind of cook book with it so you just have to look that up tooupdateso the other day we carried out an ill fated plan to steam brownies in a rice maker we google searches that and i dont want to sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist but sometimes i think google is a master deceiver the brownies came out looking like freddy kruger and after nintey minutes of persistent steaming they were sort of gelatinous with a slight fluffy appearance i dont even know how thats possible point is stick to the rice and whatever but lets not get too adventurous and you will like this cookervery happy so far"
16629,5,my wife and daughter love this rice cooker great quality and always does a great job buy itvery easy to operate and cooks a whole varity of products
17127,5,"i have read many bad reviews about this product but it works greatthe perfect measurements for the water is to add water half inch above the rice level in the steel basket would make the work easy and dont count the cups this is the key which had done a great job and my rice is perfect no sticky rice at bottom and make sure to remove the extra water at the bottom after the rice is done so that it wont become mushycarb reduce instant pot"
2243,1,its much harder to take pictures with this camera than it is to use my iphone i got the camera to take videos and the  mins i wanted to record was somehow broken up and not all of it recorded i would send it back if i couldphotos are grainy and unfocused
7776,1,couldnt use it because it wasnt workingitem doesnt work
5893,2,pictures arent great they are grayed dull i have yet to see a picture with reasonable color and be careful you can only use kodak film paper which is harder to find than other brandsi purchased this as a gift for my daughter and thought i was getting her a better version than the polaroid she wanted i had a good history with kodak and liked the memory card and editing capabilities i shouldnt have over thought itnot great
1705,1,ugh i hate it sending back within an hour of having terrible qualityi hate it
11805,5,"i spent hours looking for the absolute best rice cooker reading reviews and checking for pros and cons because i knew this would be one of my most important purchases for the kitchenset it and forget it rice comes out perfect it can slow cook meats and veggies and it can make breakfast oatmeal in the morning there are still some buttons i havent tried yet but its got a steamer basket for steaming veggies you could probably also do a couple fish fillets in it its so easy even my husband learned how to use it without even looking at the manualclean up while the inside pot is dishwasher safe i prefer to hand wash it not only because of how often i use it but the pot has a teflon coating and i dont want my powerful dishwasher stripping off that precious coating over timepro tipsif you plan to wash the pot in the dishwasher turn off the high heat dry cycle to keep your teflon coating safenever use metal spoons or forks in your teflon pot it will scratch the surface and remove the teflon always use plastic or wooden spoonsspatulasalways rinse your rice before cooking this will prevent rice sticking to the sides or crunchy rice from appearing on the bottom unless you like the crunchy part i know some people enjoy itmy swiss army appliance in the kitchen"
9646,5,cant make rice any easier than this perfect everytimelove it
2701,2, year old daughter loves the camera enjoys taking pictures of anything and everything especially the selfie mode its much smaller than i anticipated it would be but all was well until it wasntafter  weeks of use the camera stopped recognizing the sd card i also couldnt get the photos off of the sd card despite trying on multiple computers it all kind of makes the point of having a camera uselessso do i keep the camera so she can continue to just take pics that shell never be able to see again or do i return the piece of junk so i can put the funds towards something thats better quality still tbdbut dont buy this if you want it to last beyond a month wish i read the reviews instead of looking at the overall star ratingcute until it doesnt work
12853,2,"after two uses of this product we immediately fell in love with it looks incredibly beautiful easy to use so many options wonderful adding loved the weighted rice paddle and large vegetable steamer im hispanic on grew up on rice everyday and this was the best rice home made rice ive ever tastedthe problem however is that the machine showed large amounts of visible rusting after only the second use this is after hand cleaning and drying it after both uses as much as we loved the quality of rice this was making we cant justify keeping or recommending such an expensive product rusting after two usestwo stars because the rice it produces is phenomenal the fuzzy cooking logic is on point but the material quality is subparhighly visible rusting after second use"
8686,1,this camera is garbage it broke on our snorkeling trip after only taking a couple pictures checked the case was in locked position and didnt go more than a foot under water not really waterproofnot waterproof

4864,1,broke instantly and could not be fixedbroke instantly and could not be fixed
487,2,the batteries that came with the camera pop inside so not happy with cheap quality for such an important toolpiss off
12504,5,is really easy to use and dont use much spaceawesome for single or a young couple
6920,2,the camera was great for the one or two weeks that i owned it i have never given a bad review before on amazon or anywhere else to the best of my knowledge but this camera certainly was a great letdown i would give this a one star rating but i didnt hate it enough as it was a pretty good camera the pictures werent the clearest but i didnt expect top notch quality either i would say that for the price the quality of the film was on par for the pricenow the biggest issue i had with the camera was the durability as it stopped working after roughly a week and a half after perusing the web and other amazon reviews i discovered that the motor for the lens was the likely culpritfor anyone wanting to buy this camera read the bad reviews most people say it works well for a few months while some others get it defective from the box mine lasted two weeks if youre ok with a disposable camera that is likely to break its not a bad offer im not too mad at it i just wished i didnt buy so much film since it was bound to breakworks great while it lasts
12407,5,i love rice but stove cooking rice is just not it this rice cooker is amazing made my rice and my kids even asked if it was restaurant bought rice super easy to clean the best rice

14073,5,i love this rice cooker i really love the low carb setting as well the only flaw is no porridge setting i would like to make congee with it but i dont know which setting to use anyone knowporridge
14745,5,i had my  cuckoo rice cooker for ages it made great rice but the steam coming out of that was horrendous this rice cooker is really easy to use and no massive steam when i took out of the box it already had the correct clock on the monitor and i didnt even plug in how strange is that it looks great and the rice came out perfect so easy to use each cup is  serving for  servings  cups of rice and pour the water to where it is marked  thats iteasy to use with no extreme steam coming out

10641,5," i have been undergoing an attempt at body recomposition over the last year and have been tracking my food intake calories and macros diligently for the last year and a half as well as doing dedicated weight training  week the old saying goes abs are made in the kitchen and it couldnt be more true no matter how heavy and consistently i lift i have to hit my food targets if i want the greatest success what makes it even more difficult is my husband and son arent exactly doing this with me and dont like to eat the way i eat so i make a lot of meals for  one of my go to dinners is heirloom organic black forbidden rice with chicken and broccoli i only ever eat  c to  c of uncooked rice so i absolutely love having this itsy bitsy teeny weeny rice cooker for that purpose yes i could make large batches of rice one day a week and just heat up how much i want each time i eat it but truth be told i like the taste of freshly cooked rice so much better however i dont want to use my monster size food steamerrice cooker for  c of black rice this really is the perfect sizethe only thing i have found through experimentation that doesnt exactly jive with the instructions is that when youre cooking  c of uncooked rice black or brown you still need at least  c of water or it will come out undercooked and slightly crunchy using  c of water makes it come out perfectly every time in about  minutesi also love that the cooking bowl is black so that my black rice doesnt stain its a simple little gadget and immediately starts warming as soon as you plug it in i wish you could plug it in and then turn it on but it only has two settings warm and cook as soon as its done cooking it immediately switches to warm which is where it will stay until you unplug it i love how easy it is to store and how little precious real estate it takes up in my kitchen cupboards i use it at least twice a week and so far it works like an absolute champ every time i also love the adorable color and the rice scoop it comes with it couldnt be easier to use and cleani sincerely hope this review has been helpful for someone else and yes i paid full price for it feel free to ask any questionsmust have for meals for one and tracking macros"
14125,5,this electric rice cooker is small and exquisite the material is good and the appearance is goodlooking the cooking is fast and delicious it is suitable for our family it is recommendedis great
17381,5,we have cooked a few different types of rices and beans with it it has performed very well we have noticed the difference it vs the other pots with coil heater owned before congee wont stick on the pan and regular rice pieces have better texture and taste it seems to have perfect control on the heat distribution temperature and cook time the fit and finish are pretty good overall its build quality and cooking results justify the price premium over cheap rice cookersit cooks perfect rices and beans
15354,5,this rice cooker has lasted longer than any other has through all the congee cakes rice oatmeal atleat  times a week atempted yougarts the failures where on my end and stews this rice cooker has been my cooking rock i love to put oatmeal or rice in the day before at have the timer set so when my nibblings can have a hot breakfast while i get to sleep in a little later or making chicken congee when someone isnt feeling well or doesnt feel like cooking this is also my ace on the hole when i want to add extra veggies to our diet without be too obvious i essentially use it as an all in one rice cooker and crock pot  out of  would recommend never failed me after over  years
9243,1,stopped printing pictures after only  weeks very unsatisfiedweak product
11488,4,"the thing i like best about the greenlife rice cooker is there is no steam hole at the top which allows the steam to escape during cooking the aroma sputters and spits and gets rice starch on anything in its vicinity however when you open the lid of the greenlife there is water on the underneath side of the top lid which then spills onto the base which you have to mop up with a paper towel ive included a picture but its not easy to see all the waterthe aroma is nonstickthe greenlife is at first but if you leave any stragglers they stick hard to the bowl insert and you have to let it soak and still the grains dont come off easilythe aroma takes  minutes to cook  or  cups the greenlife takes  minutesthe aroma has a very small bowl so to add butter i have to empty the rice into another bowlnot so with the aroma there is plenty of room in the aroma bowl since it holds  cups of cooked ricei love the pink color and it doesnt take up much room on the counter the cord is rather shortbasically the invisible vent hole and the pink color are the two best features of the greenlifethe aroma is perfectly nonstick cooks rice in  mins and you can serve rice from the bowl the only drawback is the vent hole in the lidwhat i dislike about both of them is you need a flashlight to pour water to the fill line because without a light you cant see itcomparison between  aroma rice cooker and the greenlife"
6175,2,i liked the product but did not use if for a while and when i got it out the clear panel was frosted over and you could not see any thing through it i tried to contact the manufacturer but got no responsethe build and design were fine just the clear panel that is no longer cleardoes not stay clear
2541,2,the pictures print out with harsh lines i tried changing the settings and nothing will remove it defectivenot working
4038,2,i use dropcam indoors but need an outdoor cameras for minor security and to keep an eye on things i purchased the arlo on strong reviews and flexibility it gave me in placement i have  total it has a nice wide range of vision so  covers my entire exterior the video quality is only fair but good enough to identify people and whats going on its rather pixelated at times for things in motion i tried the best video setting and it wasnt noticeably better since almost all captures are not of interest ill save that setting for known events setup was a breeze and the wifi range is very long batteries lasted about  months which is about what i expected im going to modify the settings to avoid cars triggering the video but unfortunately i cant trim off the road from the top view modifying the view maintains the aspect ratio so i lose some on the width by reducing the height the onescrew mounting of the bracket is fine for most uses i did want the camera view to run along the sides of my house because i care more about whats happening near the house rather than far away it makes a difference for motion detection too since the unit does not detect motion well around the edges of the view when you try to place the camera to the far left or right it becomes too much weight for the plastic bracket i had no drive nails on each side of the bracket to keep it from pivoting motion detection ive turned the sensitivity up and down to try to get a good balance get a lot of undesired detection from blowing branches and palms we feed birds squirrels and ducks even though they are always moving it doesnt trigger unless there is fast motion it doesnt detect well around the perimeter i have to mount it at least  feet up so it doesnt get stolen which cuts down on its effective range a bit cars driving by trigger it but dog walkers usually dont wanted to see which owner isnt picking up but the activity it too slow of too far away the cars are much farther away than the sidewalk it does need lateral movement ive slowly walked straight up the camera then did jumping jacks nothing if i walk normally then it records ive watches recordings that caught the tail end of something or actually missed that action because its sometimes low to react detection is reduced further at night cloud storage im grateful to receive free cloud storage with no further obligation a lot of companies offer some free storage i would have preferred to receive a little more for having purchase  cameras than someone with  yes i could pay for more but it wouldnt be a problem except for how the storage works it seems to keep  days for me when it runs out of storage the cameras stop recording so im likely to miss a critical new event but the old videos ive had plenty of time to review are preserved i have to manually delete old videos one day at a time forever to keep the cameras recording i would have preferred an option to allow the oldest videos to expire rather than not capture a new event i have full storage notification set but i havent received any same for batteries i like that i can easily share a single capture and it can be easily viewed by the recipient but i dont have to give them access to the camera or library there arent a lot of extras since there is no sound and it isnt running constantly like my dropcamsim fully invested but if i had to purchase again id either go for a more expensive system to get the quality or a cheaper systems for the same level of features and quality this system doesnt provide good value for the many hundreds of dollars spent and extensive time fussing over itwould not purchase again so many issues
9176,2,camera didnt work memory card got stuck said it was full editing my review as i did receive a response and they did offer a refund maybe i just got a lemon of a cameradoesnt work but quick to give a refund
2077,2,i love the appearance and casing however it lacks the basic feature of light differentiation such as indoor sunny cloudy settings it is has proven wasteful of film for instance it fails to eject film after snapshots the film latch has come open exposing the film in its entirety the pics do not come out as clear as they do on my previous blue instax poloroid camera overall disappointed and not worth the investmentdisappointed
3105,2,not sure if its the film or camera or both but these come out quite dull colorless the first pack was a pinkishpurple tint another is greenblue some pictures didnt even develop and came out as a dud wouldnt recommendweird coloring dark
3825,2,terrible camera does not work without plugging into an outletcamera does not work
3624,2,a piece of back of the camera where the film snaps into place snapped off and now i cant close the compartment that encloses the filmbroke easily
5382,1,it was a christmas gift to my grandaughter and it does not work properly will have to return it sorry 
15699,5,got this for my friend who lives alone and doesnt need to make  cups of rice for herself its the perfect size and cooks rice well nice that it can do the other functions but shell probably only use it for ricegreat size for single use
12135,4,so we had a different rice cooker for  years and when it finally died the idea of shopping for a rice cooker was not too appealing my wife liked this one but was hesitant because it was more expensive than other options that were out there but we eat a lot of rice in the house and its not as if its going to waste i initially bought this model through amazon warehouse but would it arrived there was a defective plug and i had to return it true to form amazon was quick to accept the return but we were a little gunshy about reordering from the warehouse so i bit the bullet and paid full freight its super easy to use and the rice tastes great my only gripe if i can even call it that is that rice takes an hour there is a fast cook setting that will cook in about  minutes but it doesnt taste exactly the same our previous rice maker took about  minutes start to finish so we had kind of gotten used to that cycle but if youre okay with an hour then youll really like it clean up is simple and its relatively compact the cord retracts really well so it hides nicely in a cupboard all in all i give it  out of  because of the longer cook time and differentiation in taste of the rice cooked at  minutes versus an hourgreat rice cooker
264,1,i took less than  photos before a shadow developed couldnt find a fix for it and no one else had my problem online so i asked for a refundbroke fasts
16832,4,"i love my purchase suits our kitchen as i am into minimal stylevery straightforward to usei couldve gave a  the reason for the  is because when the rice is cooking or while its boiling the water splash all over the top  i mean there is no other place for the water to go but its very easy to clean thoughminimal"
8163,1,i liked this camera for a few months its only good at one thing its the long battery life but what is the point of that battery life if the camera freezes the camera also has audio issues that makes the sound noisy if youre serious about a camera get something that isnt thisthe customer service is abysmal they will send you the same generic support with copy and paste response most of the issues you will find is the camera and not the sd card or whatever this camera is just frustrating to operate due to it not being consistent i wish gopro made a camera just like this but consistentinconsistent buggy save your money
8897,1,the camera started malfunctioning within days the lense would not open and would then shut down the camera very disapointed i would prefer to give no stars doesnt deserve  starbroke within days
11780,5,this came with a useless and confusing manual there is no guide of what the temps are for each preset so i dont know if a cake mix would use x or z setting and there of course is in their info no help on how to use the diy for unusual things like a cake so im having to do trial and error on all presets unfortunately got another brand first and it seems theyre all made by the very same manufacturer and same manuals there was no cookbook or lift device in the boxno help to use
10240,5,its really nice so i ordered again but the only complaint is smaller than the one i had which isnt that big of a deal good rice cooker heavily recommend itlost this in a house fire
11659,5,using it primarily for a diy temp slowcooker since all new slow cookers are now too hot this item is perfect for slowcooking forktender meat so glad i bought it outer shell doesnt get nearly as hot as a crockpot so thats an extra plusdoesnt heatup the kitchen or overheat countertop easy to use easy to clean would buy againlove this appliance
2586,1,we were excited to give this to our daughter for christmas however when she started trying to use it it only works half the time the pictures are poor quality and dont develop well no where near what the ad shows i wanted to return the item but in the christmas madness my husband tossed the box before realizing it wasnt going to work i planned on reaching out to the company but couldnt figure out how to contact them directly for the price we paid i expected it to atleast function properlypoor quality doesnt work
9772,4,bought this to replace a very simple lowtech rice cooker weve been using for  years i was intrigued by all the features especially for cooking various grains besides rice plus automatic cooking of risotto so far white rice brown rice and barley have come out very nice better than with our old cooker and the risotto setting lets you saute onion and vegetables as long as you want before adding the rice and going into automatic cooking mode easy to clean still playing with it using it weekly for the past month so no idea yet as to longevitya nice versatile little rice cooker
12573,5,ive had this rice cooker about a month and have used it four times the first time my rice was too gummy but i figured out what went wrong the rice needs to be put in the cooker before filling the water to the appropriate level i havent used the steamer yetso far so good
3176,1, pitches and eats up the batteries within six hours do not recommend these productsnot good
3639,1,my daughter got this for xmas but saved it for a spring break trip she used it in the morning for a photo the second time she pulled it out in the afternoon the light was not staying on we changed batteries and tried the factory reset but nothing it worked for  calendar days very disappointing she was so sad and i was sad we wasted moneybroke within the week
17600,5,have you ever had an appliance that makes you smile this one will not only does it make amazing rice but it plays a happy little tune when it starts and stops cooking i traded in my cheap former cooker for this slick compact model it makes perfect rice every time and takes up very little space no detail was too small for the designers of this product they even thought to make the power cord retractable its like this company truly understands mehappy little machine
9642,5,im a college student and ive found this easily portable and light it also doesnt get too messy whenever im using it so i dont ever have any issues ive made plenty of rice cooker meals in here before too while fancy rice cookers may be appealing theyre expensive but as a college student with a tight budget this does a great job as is and ive even cooked noodles in itgreat for college students
9413,5,we replaced our old rice cooker this is a very sleek appliance it is very easy to use and provides options for different types of rice and textures it is also extremely quick and simple to clean the inner lid pops out and can be cleaned easilyexcellent purchase
9980,5,i live alone what does that mean it means that i dont need a huge quantity of rice for my meals when i read the instructions the smallest quantity of rice that could be cooked up was  of a cup with the provided measuring cup that came with the cooker i abandoned the cup and just went with the measuring ratio that comes with the rice long and short of it the rice is coming out perfect every time i make it with the smaller quantities which so far is down to  of a cup i have yet to use the other features of this rice cooker which cleans up very easily by the way maybe i will and maybe i wont either way this gets five stars from me as it gives the results i need which is hit and miss most of the time on the stove and im a fairly decent chefmakes fantastic rice all the time
15803,5,easy to use just follow instructions rice came out perfect so helpful a must havetime saver

2323,1,it was brokenit was broken and would not stay on so i returned it
3506,1,i bought this camera based on all of the positive reviews when i open the box i see a card for a  gift card for a  star review and alarm bells were going off but i still wanted to give the camera a shot i unboxed and put in an sd card my own better quality one and then put in the battery so i could charge itproslightweightfast chargetwo batteriesarrived quicklyconsabsolutely awful pictures thought it had plastic over the lensebattery is very difficult to removeno flash you have to go into settings to turn on a light that doesnt really do anything to brighten the picturenot much of a zoomi really wish this camera had worked out the low picture quality unless lighting was perfect and the subject and photographer completely still was a deal breaker for me also the inability to change the batteries easily makes having two batteries useless maybe i got a dud but i wouldnt recommend getting this cameraabsolutely awful
5386,1,i sent this back after about a week i never was able to get the screen to come i charged it to no availunable to maneuver
896,1,this thing would lucky to have  megapixel of resolution the audio is terrible all of the specs in the listing are flat out lies they also sent me a letter saying that they would give me a discount on future purchases if i gave them five stars but only i didnt say anything about it in my reviewextremely poor quality

4088,2,the total wireless concept is great on this produce which is why im giving  stars instead of  it is the feature that attracted me to the system to begin with im sad to say however that all in all i have been very disappointed in this system ive been using it for about  months and have had continuous and multiple problems with it ill give a few examples here i have a camera at my front door and motion detection is severely delayed with it when the mail carrier delivers a package the camera doesnt begin capturing video until she is turning around and walking back to her vehicle which defeats the purpose completely because you never see a face another example i have a camera by the garage entrance it sets off motion detection when it feels like it i can drive my big truck into the garage right in front of the camera and it not ever detect a thing sometimes i can walk right past it and sometimes it will detect me sometimes it wont and most of the time when it does its only after ive gotten right in front of it capturing no video of me walking towards it at all ive spoken to netgear tech support about these issues and they tell me that they are designed to detect motion from side to side instead of walking directly toward it i think that is a terrible design but i tested it out both ways anyway just to see for myself and neither way seems to make much difference another fix they tell me to try is to increase the motion sensitivity on the camera ive tried that too only to now constantly get false motion detection alerts the app says there was motion detected but theres nothing there on the video there is no happy medium where the system actually works as it should i also get notifications all the time that motion has been detected only to go to the app to watch the video and there be no video captured at all about  months into the system one of my cameras began showing me everything in pink i had to get a warranty exchange for the camera and received an obviously used refurbished replacement the battery life on the cameras has been decent but that is about all i hope this review helps others in their decision making if youre considering this system i would encourage you to choose a different one it has been a bad purchase for methe total wireless concept is great on this produce which is why im giving  
7329,2,poor sound quility wifi will only stay live to my smartphone for  minutes was birthday gift very disappointed wish i could send it backdisappointed
5599,2,i was looking for a decent camera that was easy to use and gave me good picture it was easy to use but thats where it stopped i have taken at least a hundred photos they just dont come out well also the battery life is rather short so make sure carry the extra battery and dont be surprised when you are looking for an outlet to charge the batteries i am looking at a new phone the pictures on phones are very good that i have seen so far keeping looking you can do betternot the quality photo you might want
8119,1,havent been able to use this much as the flash doesnt work and all pictures come out too dark we have done all the troubleshooting and still no luck returning the camera for a refund and unfortunately we also wasted half a pack of film for testing after the troubleshooting film is very expensive and no way of contacting amazon to request a refund 
1097,2,maybe my expectations where to high given the price point but i ended up returning the cameraok
4017,1,cute watch but it broke after my son wore it for a daybroken after a day
17262,5,overall very happy with this product i replaced my crockpot with this and have not regretted it recommendedmultipurpose cooker
666,1,this was given to me as a present i was excited to see it says  and  which as i will explain is not true with the camera i recieved i know cameras and i can tell you it is a complete waste of money i would buy it for my kids if it was not more than  dollars the buttons and knobs are all plastic as is the body as well feels like a toy the knobs dont actually turn of course because there really is very little to adjust as it has no lens there is just a flat piece of protective glass the settings allow for up to  quality photos around the resolution of my flip phone thats a far cry from  which only the most expensive cameras take the video resolution i was able to take was full hd not  either and didnt have a quality look i consider this a good toy camera but would not pay more than  dollars for  dollars you can do much much bettertoy camera  it only takes  max pictures no lens low quality knobs are for decoration plastic
6907,1,i was liking the camera minus not having a timer or a reflective mirror to take photos of yourself hands free i brought the camera with me to visit family and friends to take some pictures while on the trip and the camera would not turn on and was blinking e with the flag symbol i went to use it for the first memorable moment and it disappointed i barely had the the thing for a month and of course the return period was  days before this happenedstopped working after  photos
627,1,not good shakes and doesnt make good pictures and they will change the mode by itself and its not goodnot good
8409,1,dont know couldnt get it in the camera the camera wouldnt stay shutdont buy it junk
11428,5,i bought this rice cooker for a friend and she loves it its small cute great for an apartment or for someone with roommates and limited storage  gift
2748,1,package came open missing parts and looked like it was already usedalready used
15303,5,quality product i am very happy to use pressure cooker every day 
4109,1,the line of sight distance between the base station and the camera only supported about  feet which is far lower than what they claim to support they claim to support up to  feet there is a chance that it is because i live in a densely populated area and so maybe there is some wireless interference from all of the wireless routers in this areamy camera blinked yellow when it was about  feet away from the base station i positioned the base station in a window think of placing the base station on a first story window ledge and then walking  feet across your lawn or street and then the camera does not work at about  feet it blinked green worked i needed it to work for at least  feet and so i returned it that was a blocker for mei was disappointed with the picture quality i was expecting betteralso almost every time i logged into the arlo web site to view my picturesvideo i would first get the error we are sorry the database service is currently down please try again or we are sorry arlo is currently not available they should add a more accurate message saying we are sorry we do not know how to run an online service and so please forgive us for our lack of respect for your time and moneyfor the arlo web site when you login the login button is not automatically selected when you hit enterif you want to quickly delete any pictures taken with your camera you cannot do so as of november  their  web site does not support deleting pictures from the recycle bin apparently they automatically delete pictures after they have been in the recycle bin for  days i can see that being a pro and con it is a pro because then nobody can delete pictures to try and cover their tracks for example if they find your camera while robbing your homeoverall it is a great idea given it is netgear ill try again in a few years to see if they have the issues resolvedline of sight distance between the base station and the camera only supported about  feet
10922,5,works well no complaintsexcellent for the price
11065,5,if you need a small batch grain cooker this is a good choice i use it for oatmeal rice quinoa and grits i use the steamer basket for frozen gyoza i put a little black garlic salt in the rice steam the gyoza over the rice and have a very easy dinner perfect size for a single person
16923,5,easy of use the flavor is better and the texture is greatloving it more each day
13004,5,i have an old small  cup rice cooker hubby has been making noises about wanting a new one that will do more than plain white rice this machine does what you want it makes perfect rice but so much more hubby says the farro is better than when he makes it and it also will do oatmeal steam veggies and it says it will saute but i havent tried that yet with a  cup capacity this makes a lot for a family of two but i am happy to say that making smaller amounts also come out perfectly its so easy to use but it comes with a real manual not one of those find it online type things the markings on the inside of the pot are clear and easy to read they have made this about as foolproof as you can imagine my favorite thing about it is the keep warm function it will hold at temp for hours and it tells you how long since it was finished without grains getting mushy which gives a lot more freedom in dinner prep and hubby he is absolutely thrilled with it win win all aroundcan i give this more than  stars
7870,2,i used to like this product a lot at first i liked the price the size the sticky paper all of it its easy to set up and easy to usebut then out of nowhere it stopped working it constantly tells me its out of paper when i literally just refilled it and i have to reprint photos like  times just to get it to print then at that point the little printer gets so hot i feel like i should stop using it for safety reasons additionally the quality of the images is just going down now i have had it for  months and it glitched every now and again in those  months but now ive wasted so many sheets of paper which are not cheap by the way because the photos come out streaky and horrible pics attached im technically past the window to get a replacement but  months is not a long time for an electronic to just take a fat shit on you im disappointed and will have to spend more money in getting a different productprinter took a crap on me
13641,4,"i bought this rice cooker because i have lupus with arthritis and some mild cognitive impairments and i wanted to be able to cook things that have to simmer without melting my pots and pans or setting the house on fire i also wanted a quality product that wouldnt decimate my bank account ive had a zojirushi hot water machine for over five years now using it every day with no problems whatsoever so i figured id get this basic model rather than a brand i didnt know with maybe more bells and whistles than i could afford from this manufacturerim very happy with that choicemy son loves steel cut oatmeal it took some experimenting and one oatmeal mess all over my table but i figured out that one measuring cup of oats the cup is included to two and a half measuring cups of water gives three days of oatmeal unlike the higherend models theres no porridge setting on this machine so just watch the pot until it almost boils over about  minutes then flip the switch to keep warm for half an hour perfect you cant burn it if you forget that your cooking one of my challenges it just dries out which you can fix with more water the inner pan is nonstick which i usually avoid but nonstick coatings do not become volatile unless heated beyond waters boiling point and this pan will never get that hoti also cook brown rice in this just like with the oats its  and a half times as much water as rice and watch the pot until its boiling then flip the switch and let it simmer for about half an hour the rice can burn though if you havent rinsed it really well so set a timer steaming vegetables is super easy and there are a ton of recipes on zojirushis website and on youtubeif you can afford the extra expense get one of the models with built in timer and temperature settings they will make your life easier if you cant this one will make your life safer and a bit easier and get yourself a good timeranother great adaptive cooking aid for seniors or chronic illness"
1492,1,very cheaply made and doesnt work most of the timeone star
7007,2,i recently acquired this compact camera for my daughter who wanted to have a delightful time at her schools graduation party and capture moments with her friends the product has its pros and cons the camera itself is quite impressive with a design that appeals more to younger children rather than teenagers while the picture quality doesnt match the advertised photos it is still satisfactory however the print quality is subpar and the prints are not very clear although i appreciate the inclusion of three rolls of printing paper i do wish the print quality was better so that the kids could have enjoyed them as keepsakes for a longer timepros appealing design for younger children easy to use and kidfriendly functionality comes with three rolls of printing paper fast printing speed includes markers stickers and games for entertainment front and rear camera for easy selfies solid build quality with a rubber bumper for protection longlasting batterycons picture quality is not as good as advertised subpar print quality and prints are not very clear printed pictures are black and white wish they are in color buttons may require instructions to figure out instructions on how to load paper in camera is missing limited use for teen aged kids who prioritize picture qualityoverall the camera offers a cute design easy functionality and entertainment for younger children however it falls short in terms of picture and print quality making it less suitable for teen aged kids or those seeking higherquality photos 
10314,5,lots of options have not used them all yetmakes perfect rice every time
13638,5,at first i was a little reluctant to get this based on price alone other rice cookers are larger and are half the price however this is so much better built from the actual cooker unit the cord to the pan and rice scoop we ended up returning the other brand aroma and got this one we got the  cup unit and its perfect for two people we usually do  of the provided cups and gives us more than enough for dinner if you want leftovers two cups we typically use jasmine rice and it cooks it perfectlywell build and cooks rice perfectly
2380,1,incredibly disappointed camera stopped working with regular use after a monthdied within a month
4430,2,worked as advertised but apparently no way to delete pictures more than oneatatime we wanted to give this frame to another family member after my mother passed away i reached out to support to ask how to delete previous pictures initially they sent instructions which were apparently for a different frame as they did not match this frame at all i replied with pictures of the menus on this screen and despite  repeat inquiries i have not heard back it seems that the only way to delete the more than  photos on the frame is one at a time and support doesnt have the courage to admit the limit on their productsupport not very good
11183,5,this is a wonderful smaller ricecooker for making smaller amounts works perfectly great product good pricegreat
10473,4,dont buy it if youre planning to use it a lot better to save for a better one but if great for every once in a while useget what you pay for
32,4,its a  wireless charger not much to say about it does what it needs to do  complaints not the fastest charger out there but it does say its  so cant complain and i got  of them for under  bucks on saleits does exactly what you want it to do
10753,4,im not sure what im doing wrong rice burns and doesnt cook at the bottom  for that i took a star away i followed the manual and also did the  cup rice  cups water ratio and still burnsburns at the bottom
11319,5,"i liked this grain cooker enough i bought one for a friend i dont use white rice but can report that brown rice and quinoa cook perfectly and enough to feed  people depending on what ones cooking with it cooking steel cut oats wasnt as successful until i just let the oatmeal stay on warm for at least  minutes after it finished cooking and then it was fine doubling the time was a disaster with oats spraying out of the machineeasy clean up easy to tuck away in corner of cupboard and just plain easy to use i dont often give  stars but this is worth all of thema small kitchen delight"
17465,5,"i was very to spend so much money on the rice cooker but now im absolutely blown away well i must admit i am not a great cook at all but i can manage rice and veggies so far i had instant pot for a year but the rice was always either undercooked or mushy and overcookedthe zojirushi rice cooker is beyond any expectation i had just at one cup race fill it with water to the mark in the pot add veggies and wait an hour the rice and veggies will be most delicious fluffy exactly the right texture and it will stay that way the whole day long until evening where you have dinner exactly the way the food was when it first finished cooking i said above its the best buy a madebest thing i ever bought"
2757,1,poor quality or perhaps a dud but camera stopped working the first day it was opened will not hold memory photos gone next time its turned on at times will not hold a charge tried new batteries cables and memory cards with no luck continued inconsistent functionality junkterrible poor quality
14026,5,both of my parents are diagnosed with diabetes so i wanted to get rid of my old traditional rice cooker and wanting to try to low crab rice cooker its have a nice and elegant design and its just the right size for my parents i used regular white rice to cook according to the manual i would say it taste much better and more fluffy however as brown rice it isnt that fluffy my parents havent have white rice for long time this rice cooker allow them to control their sugar level its easy to use also like the fact it have eight different program setting plus delay timer i would set the timer in the morning so the rice would be ready in the evening when they get off work its only  cups but for make carb rice its recommended for  cups only so its not suitable for a big family it is easy to remove the parts within the cooker for cleaning just wipe it clean and put it back it has non stock inner pot so its great for just regular rice cooking since it use induction heating and fuzzy logic which make the rice taste better if you are use to old fashion rice cooker so give it a few try with the sugar removing metal tray then it will work like a charmlow carb for sugar level control
13669,5,"i recommend this product ive purchased a number of these but have only used two  the rest have been purchased as gifts this brand comes in two sizes  the smaller is great for a single person or couple very simple to operate and once you get the solidliquid ratio down you get consistent results you can use this pot to cook rice quinoa other grains or all of them at the same time thats what i do with forbidden ricetwo recommendations first watch what you use in the pot utensil wise its not easy to scratch but metal on metal isnt a good idea with this pot second i recommend handwashing the pot the liner the lid is fair game in the dishwasher but the dw detergent was too hard on the outside of the linerpot for my taste i just handwash both the liner and the lidsimple is good this works"
3731,2,arrived on time and in good condition however there was no battery charger and the included battery would not power up the lamp so i have no way of knowing how well it works i do not have access to a dc adapter will be returning the unit 
64,2,it makes a decent attempt at a usable logical ui but the picture quality is abyssmal what else is there to say really i toyed with the idea of just letting my son take an old iphone  to camp and that would have been a much better idea for so many reasonson the outside this camera looks very much like a fairly decent little canon i had about twenty years ago i guess i was sucked in by my own nostalgialesson learned its a worthwhile reminder that cheap crap is still crap and is not worth it at any priceif you love your kids just give them an old iphone
9095,1,false advertisingnot for the

6587,2,i am very disappointed by this camera other users have cited a very short battery life even when the camera is turned off i have also experienced this a fresh set of batteries rechargeable alkaline or liion will be drained in a matter of days if theyre kept in this camera even if its turned offwhile the zoom optics are not so bad overall photo quality is poor there is a lot of noise and the effective resolution is lower than the detector resolution in mediumtolow light levels this camera may work decently in highlight settings but overall my htc  phone camera outperforms this camera in almost every aspectbad battery life and bad images  bad camera

4087,1,update april  camera is now shooting video in monochrome its just shades of red after speaking with netgear they will exchange the camera because this is apparently a wide spread issue according to their support message boards but im responsible for paying the shipping to get the damaged unit back to them the rma process is drawn out and complicated taking upwards of two weeks i was about to purchase the new indoor arlo camera but after all of the issues ive had and this camera dying in  months netgear has lost a customerupdate feb  sent an email january  with the info requested in in the netgear response to my review havent heard a response to that email as of today but received an automated email asking me to take a survey and rate their support again poor customer service sorry i have to recommend against buying this product for the reasons below but mainly because the support is just nonresponsiveill update this review if things change further down the road ive had this one up and running for a few months nowi purchased just the base entry package because security cameras have a lot of improvement that needs to take place before i invest more moneyinitially i was fairly impressed with this little camera and have a lot of positive things to say about it but the few negatives are beginning to outweigh the positives which is unfortunate i think netgear is on track with this idea just need to tighten up a few things on the tech side and get your support team to be  my house alarm was triggered i have this camera facing my house so i was attempting to log in and see if there was anyone around the house time after time i tried to access the live feed the app would either fail to load the video feed or log me out really frustrating the one time i needed the camera it wasnt there for  will not detect motion from behind glass initially i mounted this on the provided magnetic stand inside the house pointing to the front porch through the  customertechnical service is unresponsive ive had two tickets opened the first one was closed without a resolution the second took well over two weeks to  totally  camera consumes very little power i have not replaced the batteries yet and they are about  decent resolution if you need to flip the camera upside down for mounting purposes you can invert the image smart move on their  fairly flexible platform and app allows you to create schedules for motion detectiongood idea but very poor quality  service
17282,5,nothing to dislike can get a little heavy but thats why it works so well have cooked many many meals in it and performs flawlessly footprint sold me compared to tradition slow cookers fits nearly anywhere using it right nowvery easy to use
15291,4,"disclaimer i am writing this review based on cooking rice only i have not used it for any of its other features including timed cookfirst the good news this made perfect rice not a single burntbrowned rice grain for me this is great because the plain rice cooking feature is the feature i will be using most oftenheres some not so good news it takes almost twice as long as my previous rice cooker to cook the rice it doesnt even show on the digital display how much time it will take to finishthe time remaining display only kicks on when you have  minutes to go but prior to the last fifteen minute countdownyou have no idea how long its going to takeas i stated before it cooks perfect riceso im willing to wait the longer time for it to be cooked perfect but i was initially surprised at how long it tookhere the main drawbackthe manual is disorganized repetitive at points unclear at other points and just confusing overalla key feature to rice cooking is the amount of rice and the amount of water yet no where in the manual does it tell you what to do there are measurement marking inside the pot for the water yet it is mentioned nowhere in the manual if i was rating the manual alone i would give this product a one star but as i have clearly stated i love the riceit is also easy to clean and i love the carrying handleon a humorous note as to preempt any bad reviews based on the short length of the power cordit says in the manual that it was intentionally designed with a short cord to prevent small children from running and tripping over the cordreally you mean the small children that i always have running and playing on my countertopdont be cheapgive me a decent length cordperfect rice but"
4939,2,i gave it a  as it didnt come with a digital card so i could take pictures right away 
11766,5," i really love my confee a good way to cook rice i used less rice  and the cooking time is much betterno need the watch the potor that the rice burn   to be honest i was a bit hesitant because i am cooking with the pot for a very long time i cant wait to explore even more what else i can dothe no so good part is that have little instructionsi had to google how much rice versus water and would be great they included a little recipe book to have an idea the multiples uses to the comfeei am very happy because i thought the simple white rice would it had different taste but to be honest love it   how it cook white ricea bit more detail instruction bookwould it be appreciated anyway a happy customer herebecause i am extremely picky about my riceand i love my comfeerecipei use  cup of uncooked short grain rice and  cup of water some salt a bit if oil can be corn oil and close it perfect rice all the time  if you going to cook  cup of rice and then is  cup of water always rinse with  water the rice before put it to cooki just love it i used it to cooked steam veggies and potatoes and is phenomenal very easy to cleanafter almost  years i still love my confee i had done onion rice yellow rice and white riceand all is phenomenal still working like a  champafter almost  years still cooking like a  champ i love it i cooked pastas steam veggie i love the modern design and the colorsit work like a champ  "
13467,5,ive been given or used other rice cookers in the past and nothing compares to the ease and perfection of this machine after ive washed my rice and put in my water all thats left for me to do is press the level down to get it started i usually prepare other things as it cooks and listen for it to click off once its done ive done short and long grain rice jasmine and basmati and every time my rice come out fluffy light and perfectly cooked though i know its not the cheapest for its size but i use it at least once a week without any problemsworks like a charm
13035,5,i was never a big fan of rice cookers mainly because i like the old fashion way of making it and how it tastes this cooker so siple to use and has a variety of ways to make things plenty of recipes to choose from and all contents are dishwasher safe i love the digital front and will be gifting it to my daughter when she leaves for college she van make eggs and even oatmeal with a delay timer of neededmost impressive cooker
12492,5,so easy to use and makes perfect rice nonstick is amazing and i would definatley reccomendperfect rice every time
11388,5,not wanting to drag out my big rice cooker when its just the two of us i bought this little pink cutie it works perfectly easy to choose rice time etc and it makes me smilecute
17041,5,makes perfect sticky ricenice
5129,1,camera arrivedmuch excitement opened it up read the manual very brief tried formatting the sd card  nothing worked tried setting the date no go you can get to the menu press ok then it does not respond further cover to usb port came off fight away hooked usb cable to laptop to check photo quality  nothing happened zoom is not great but is easy to work like the dial for various modes just doesnt work great all in all very disappointing the manual is useless other than showing what button is whatdont buy
971,1,i thought this would be a simple point and shoot and this camera is a nightmare total waste of moneytotal piece of crap i want a refund now
15242,4,very easy to use easy to clean so far so good  just make sure you do  ration with water and rice its not the same as cooking in a pot
7225,1,this morning the snap suddenly popped open my  camera crashed to floor and is broken beyond repairbeware of flimsy snap
7156,1,product didnt work ordered replacement which also didnt work returned and still waiting for refund for  weeksgarbage
8978,1,why why why would a company make a camera that uses a battery so odd that it is impossible to replace it so no battery no camera ill never buy a battery pack type of camera again give me the good old aa batteries any day compared to the hours i have wasted trying to find the correct battery with the strange notches in it stupid is all i can saycannot replace battery
3642,2,dont be fooled by the image it only comes with two fujifilms very misleadingmisleading
4344,1,im on my motorcycle in mexico i bought this for the trip after about one week it has failed i can not return iti suggest no one buy this item it has no quality flimsy is the wordthis has made my trip very difficult i repeat do not buy this product it is faulty and your camera could be damagedthe company was unavailable for helppoor quality
9595,5,i gave this as a gift to my daughter she wanted one that was simple to use and not complicated this one did the job she has given me great feedback a month ago my rice cooker died so my daughter bought me one just like hers now we are both happy rice makersgave as gift  got great feedback  got one for myself since
6034,1,i ordered this because my  year old grandson requested a camera for his birthday on line the camera looked larger with larger buttons for a child to use as its advertised for children  it is tiny and the ad does not say anything about computer games on the camera either why my grandson now instead of taking pictures he plays computer games till the camera is taken away his parents have until now not gotten any computer games for him not happynot what i expected
9600,5,love my rice cooker  will not use any other brand love
10262,5,this rice cooker is great greg for someone who struggles with cooking rice on the stovemakes perfect rice every time
6918,1,i have ordered this item twice now and still i had problems the first time i used it once and then it just stopped working even after i changed the batteries the second time i also used it once and when i went to turn it on the same thing happened and it didnt turn on i went to change the batteries and the batteries were rusted so badly i cleaned it out and tried new batteries and no luck i do not recommend buying this product i would have loved to use this which is why i bought the item the two times i used the camera it was great and i loved how the pictures came out the product just doesnt last i do love how big it is and the quality of the picture when it does work im really disappointed in this item dont recommend
10237,5,works great used about  dozen times before this review and gave disappointedworth the money
5466,1,my prior camera i owned was a panasonic  point and shoot which i loved but after owning for  years and using pretty much on a daily basis it started getting distracting error messages all the time so very hard to use anymore i thought id replace it with a larger panasonic with wider lens capabilities longer zoom power etc in using this new camera for the last  days photo quality and sharpness are very hard to achieve did a lot of fiddling with the settings but i could see that this camera was not going to cut it for me especially for the price i paid for it i am returning it back to amazon for a refundexcited to own this camera what a let down
119,2,had a  yr tech support package i paid for but after calling  times and got hung up  times by your employeesi feel this camera falls short of being perfect my  picture came out not the color it was supposed to be the picture had purple in it but it came out blue i cannot take the bs that your tech support people do and they hang up anytime they like to without proper help in my issue this camera is a waste of my  and yours in the futurenice camera but
15856,5,"i got tired of my old rice cooker always screwing up meal plans so i upgraded to this its compact and stays out of the way while i prepare other items i love that this makes a basic serving size  dry cups makes  cooked cups for me and my family so its easy to just pop everything in it and walk awaycleaning was very easy but definitely take care while doing it i suggest soaking and using a soft sponge or cloth to keep the ceramic from being weathered and damagedfast and cooks rice perfectly"
15074,5,this was a great find for me i cooked the most tender flavorful roast potatoes and carrots i ever cooked in this cooker easy cleanup too glad i bought thisglad i bought this
5480,1,this is my second lumix camera both have just stopped working i bought this sept  not even two years old and they want me to pay for there faulty cameradont buy id give a zero if i could
1489,1,my daughter opened this gift today and it was defective contacted seller so we shall seedefective product
9931,5,"i had been wanting a rice cooker for a long time and with so many choices out there it was hard to decide what to go with but let me tell you this cooker is pretty awesome very easy to use and cleanyou dont have to necessarily spend a fortune to get quality rice cooked im very happy with thisbest lil rice cooker"
16613,4,this rice cooker takes about  hour to cook rice give or take  minutes with how much water you put in theres a fast setting which cooks it in  minutes but the problem is knowing how much water to cook the rice with after its been rinsed lots of different cook methods to chose from make sure you save the booklet so you remember what setting to cook long grain or short grain rice incooks rice perfectly
5977,1,let me list all the ways this device disappoints i have trouble connecting it to my computer so i have to remove the sd card the quick app is absolute garbage and i cant find my downloaded videos anywhere the time lapse quality isnt all that great and easily gets grainy during low light conditions i have seen smart phone timelapses that are better the tiny touch screen is very hard to navigate the battery holder is a hassle to open it doesnt save which mode you used last and defaults to video every time overall a grossly overpriced and overrated deviceloads of problems
6961,1,bought it since already have instax mini and thought the wide one would be a really nice add on little did i know its not good at all blurry quality and lens isnt calibrated with viewfinder totally disappointed  the instax mini has way better quality i do not recommend this camera look at other optionsblurry pictures
838,2,the camera works okay however after few clicks the shutter button stop working and it keep need to restart and even i did pull out battery few times so if you are looking for something little lasting try other brand in marketnot a good one in market
14807,5,this is by far the best rice cooker ive ever come across it doesnt burn rice rice stays nice and hot fresh all day even  day and it doesnt get mushy at all the best thing about itthe best period
11082,5,it does everything it was advertised to do i really enjoyed making brown rice and quinoa so farnice product
11945,5,if you are on the fence on a this rice maker let me tell you that this was the best invention since sliced bread i love rice and this makes the most perfect rice of my life keeps it warm for a long time too so easy to use and clean a really good investmentdont walk run
2055,2,i got the polaroid now because i heard good things about the brand and this seemed like a more modern version that i could get into yes it has a classy look to the camera a film but the prints are very low qualitylow quality prints
4064,2,i have been a netgear consumer for some time and currently own a netgear nighthawk router extender and cable modem all of which perform reliably based on this history i purchased the onecamerabase station arlo package like me i presume most arlo buyers are attracted to a home security system that doesnt require drilling holes in walls to run camera cables arlo marketing appears to address this group of consumers to netgears credit arlo was extremely simple to install with simple instructions and only a few steps from start to finish the camera picture is very good in the day time less so at night even with night vision turned on if there is ample lighting where the camera is pointing this improves the image substantiallymy primary issue with arlo and the reason for the low rating is that the security system is not reliable for example you may think the system is working for you and find out later when you access the app that the camera has been offline all night and there has been no notification to you that that the camera is not working for the system to operate correctly the camera unit must stay in sync with the base station because all video from the camera goes through the base station if that communication link is down then all bets are off syncing is very simple but the camera must be  feet from the base station during the sync process unfortunately my camera loses sync regularly approximately every  days requiring the camera to be removed from its outside mounting and brought indoors near the base station to perform a resync my camera is mounted well within the distance limit between camera and base station per the arlo instructions when i contacted netgear that my camera is going offline regularly they responded promptly that i should resync the camera well of course the only way to bring the camera back online is to resync but why does it go offline unpredictably a few days later question not answerednetgear would do well to implement a heartbeat signal between the camera and base station when the base station gets no heartbeat from the camera then it notifies the owner that the security system is not operating better yet fix the problem of the camera going offline regularly until these problems are rectified you cant call this a home security system i wouldnt even recommend arlo as a nannycam unless you dont really want to see what the nanny is doing in which case you dont need a camera very disappointed in netgears execution of this product the technology is out there but the implementation is underdevelopedadditional comment arlo requires  relatively expensive  lithium batteries check battery prices on amazon i live in a warm climate and my batteries must be replaced about every  weeks i was willing to live with the battery cost for the convenience of not having to run cable wires but i expected a reliable system see abovedisappointed in netgear  who wants an unreliable home security system
1562,1,the only good thing i can say is that the package came with all the parts and accessories that it was supposed to the photo quality is very poor especially if digital zoom is involved in the manual it states something about fixed focal length of  feet so that means that everything not at three feet distance will not be in focus hmmm yeah its in the manual and other reviewers have commented on this as well there is no autofocus which was going to be important to me the camera does feel very cheap and i suspect will break almost immediately under any kind of usage so after taking maybe  photos under various conditions and reviewing them i packed it back up and returned to amazon one photo attached to this review is of our back patio and the image quality is almost usable though  it is not the second was a digital zoom of the watering can in the first photo without me moving from the original spot uh nope just try to look at them on your computer and see how that goesalmost no photos turn out usable
10686,5,i love this rice cooker i can feed all  of us at home off the rice i fix in it it is easy to use and most importantly it is easy to clean ive never had my rice to stick in this or to burn while cooking i love the fact that it is a one pan meal as well throw your rice seasonings and water and in under  minutes it is ready to eatfantastic product
7011,2,what i liked about the camera is that its small lightweight and it comes with a lens cover the strap is sturdy and wellmade what i disliked immediately about the camera is that the sd card slot does not have a cover and is unprotected which would allow dirt to enter and damage the camera the screen flips which would be great if it was easy to open there is no indentation or grooves to grab the flip screen so its difficult to open and it does not rotate ive had digital cameras in the past and these are very important issues that make or break a camera i will be returning itcute but disappointed
3720,2,stop working after  months the light will not turn onstop working after  months
3444,2,took the camera out of the box and read the instructions on how to load paper so i went to take the back off to insert paper and noticed that the tabs on it were bent and the back wouldnt sit flush with the rest of the camera im returning it and buying the instax mini  in broken
4029,1,one of the few only amazon daily deals i regret jumping on slowest security product ive ever used this thing is really ridiculous the ios app barely works you try to use the position mode for a camera and it just does nothing  of the time unless you force quit the app and open it again it reports the cameras as busy even though they shouldnt bewhen trying to access your cameras you can only have  person connected at a time if someone else connects you are logged outyou then have to type your username and password in again the system barely works configuration is so very limited that you end up with lots of erroneous alerts as it is very time consuming to tune the motion triggers or to control when they are activewhen you attempt to access the live stream of your cameras you should expect to see please wait a lot like more often than not or just as frequently you should expect to see the request timed out no explanation of why no way to troubleshootjust failure to work and i am supposed to trust this as a security product if the thing cost  the price maybe these major defects would be tolerable but not at the price they charge these two problems alone are a deal breaker have a camera by your door and want to quickly see who rang the doorbell before walking down  flights of stairs too bad no one is going to wait around while you try to access the camera for  minutesno method of integrating this with any other systems why they dont have ifttt or zapier or any other system is a mystery so you are stuck with ridiculously limited schedules to control when the cameras should be active or not which seems very shortsighted in the day so the internet of things i have a security system i would want the cameras to be active only when the security system is armed i dont want it to waste the precious and finite battery life recording me mowing the lawn but guess whatthe only way around that is manually changing the camera mode and them remembering to change it backwhile you are trying to manage the ridiculous rules you select how much to record in seconds but it doesnt bother to tell you what that actually means for your cloud storage why doesnt it look at your image quality settings and say  seconds  or whatever the storage requirement isas it is an important factor you recording means nothing if it rolls off due to insufficient space but they give you nothing to try to plan around thaton the motion detecting functionality there is no easy way to test it so you can adjust it sure they claim to offer a test mode in the app but the majority of the time you try to use it will just fail to work with such a useful error as the motion detection test mode failed to start the request timed out please try again and you do again and againand you resort having to go through and edit the rulesactivate them go to your camera and walk around and then wait for the system to tell you that it detected motionif it didnt you have to then go adjust the rules rinse repeat as you want to avoid wasteful motion triggers because of the limited battery lifeevery other security camera product i have used allowed you to select which portion of the image was used for motion detection but not arloit uses an infrared detector that you cant control whatsoever which means if you have a road or public sidewalk that gets lots of traffic in view of this wide angle lens you will likely be given false notifications continuously also depleting your battery life and your precious cloud storageit is obvious this is an immature and rushed to market it is focused more on the wow factor than actually being useful i like that the cameras are small and can run on battery but the fact that you have no choice of anything but battery is ridiculous the fact that the system stomps all over your existing wifi channels is also ridiculous i live in an urban area with lots of wifi around mei have to actually select my network carefully i understand they want to make it easy but give advanced users some controlthis entirely cloud based system is flawed exactly due to being entirely cloud based i have fast reliable business internet service with  latency to most major sites and  download  upload however there seems to be problems with the arlo service itself which leads to the biggest problem with this system if netgear decides to not invest in this and fails to scale the cloud services you get crap serviceor if in  months after you fork over  to buy the system netgear decides this science experiment isnt what they hoped congratulations you now have  worth of paperweights there is no guarantee that the service will be around in  years or  monthsvery expensive science experiment and ineffective
4401,2,i was so excited to give this to my mom for christmas screen is awesome size i was replacing her old one which only had about a  rotating photo screen additionally thinking it would be great to send her photos from all the family however trying to setup it up isnt as easy as promoted the control buttons are on the back which makes it difficult to select what you need on the front it isnt a touch screen my fault not noticing and since she has limited right side movement from a stroke it would be impossible for her to take it off the wall or her night stand to get to the control buttons her aids would even struggle setting up with her during covid lockdowns im very computer and tech savvy and this was cumbersome for me to setup with up and down arrows on the back of the frame going to return and look into a brookstone model my cousin said she got for christmas and its very easy and she isnt technologically minded keeping fingers crossednot easily suitable for elderly mom in nursing home during covid lockdowns
16589,5,i got the used  acceptable one and the product itself is still good as new the box was obviously used and the bottom part of the pot has some obvious proofs of being used but for the price it is a deal it does make my rice give the perfect texture of being sticky like a japanese rice  would recommend it looks aesthetic toocuckoo very good
17368,5,im shocked at how amazing this rice cooker is i typically made my rice on the stove and would get the typical stuck to the bottom and uncooked on the top and the rice in a bag gets expensive and isnt that great either so i thought id make my life easier and our rice better after  years of cooking it that way and get one of these this rice is on par with any fine dining restaurant ive ever had good rice in so im guessing a lot of kitchens use this machine too its expensive but was worth every penny easy to clean and the rice tastes amazing when you follow the instructions im looking forward to cooking a variety of rices now as well thanks to their guide and suggestions rice is no longer a filler at our dinner table this is a big feature of any dish im  years old and feel like i just ate rice for the first time it was that much of a difference in quality and i didnt think i was terrible at cooking it the stovetop way wrong this is worth the extra money if youre on the fencewow so this is what rice tastes like
15294,5,quick and durable cooks to perfectiongreat item
2482,1,cant access menu to change date none of the buttons worknone of the buttons work waste of time ordering
15102,4,we use it for everything from rice to stes pot roastsoup making dump cakescandy bread chili steaming eggs potatos making dulce deleche poaching chicken for fresh chicken salad meatloaf spaghetti i can make just about anything i want in a crock pot pressure cooker its hard to use because everything except the diy setting doesnt seem to allow a temp change or cook time change even the diy function wont go up last  degrees it takes entirely too long to cook things like beans at that tempthe directions make it difficult to use anything except diy function
16208,2,"updatei had to lower the rating on this today because i loaded it up to make a cup of rice pushed the button and nothing happened worked fine for a year and the last time i used it a few days ago poor thing seems to have lost the will to live just sitting there unplugged was it something i said was it something alexa said while i was out she gets a bit catty whenever i bring home another appliance maybe the rice maker died of a broken heart after i gave my cute little red twoslice toaster to my son after sitting together on the counter for a year perhaps they had formed some sort of attachment appliances are smarter than they used to be what with their embedded processors and the internet of things and all so these days its hard to know what they might be thinking or talking to each other about this little thing was smart enough to make an excellent cup of rice all by itself so i suppose it could be smart enough to fall in love with someone and then get depressed when the relationship falls apart it takes a fair amount of intelligence to cook rice properly but you certainly dont need much upstairs to fall in love thats for sure take me for example i cant cook rice by myself but i fell in love with something that could and by golly now that its gone and died im kind of depressed and not just because i really wanted a cup of rice this evening i suppose i could just ask alexa to order another one  it would arrive in two days im not sure i want to ask her to though given her attitude about other appliances she was surly for weeks after i had her order my little george foreman twopatty hamburger grill  couldnt even report the weather without a lot of sarcasm in any case i have mixed feelings about getting another rice cooker so soon after this one died sure id like to start having rice again im only human but i just dont feel ready to get involved in another appliance relationship right now i suppose its silly to feel this way but i do ill give it a few days no need to rush things in the meantime theres always quinoa though its not really a good substitute for riceoriginal review while it was still alivepros makes a nice cup of rice does not require much space on my counter top just right for me  a single guy in a tiny apartmentconsyou have to unplug it to turn it off though thats not really much of a conthe pot s nonstick surface looks like the cheap thin kind that scratches easily if you are not careful about what you use to scoop things out it and clean it but i have been careful and havent scratched it yet and for the price you cant expect it to have a top quality surfaceoops stopped working how depressing"
16353,5,"lovethis productuse almost dailystill working"
452,1,the camera will not turn on charged battery and all  nothing its just completely not working i am so upsetrecieved broken camera
3033,1,i was shocked that they would send a refurbished camera  yet i paid for new the case that was recommended doesnt fit well overall i would never recommend this product big disappointment specially that it was purchased for a childas a gift  
10125,5,"tldr buy this its amazing theres no need to buy a fancier model this makes perfect rice is simple is inexpensive and does not take up much roomas someone with extensive experience in the kitchen both professionally and at home i cannot imagine anything simpler to cook than rice there are only  ingredients rice  water and its not very complicated with so many appliances in my kitchen why bother with another thing to buy use once and take up storage space i have enough gadgets that seemed great on paper air fryers bread makers etc which did not do the job as well as i could do using traditional methods and which were often difficult to clean and maintain so a rice cooker a machine to replace the easiest food in the world to cook whymy wife had suggested one after all all of the restaurants that served rice used them but i explained probably incorrectly they need to make a lot of rice we dont and thats probably why they use them then i came across an article in one of my favorite food magazines where they test products and came across their review of rice cookers this rice cooker received the highest rating and was the least expensive of all their tests and this is a serious chefs magazine not supported by advertising their reviews are spoton and unbiased and so i bit the bullet and thought that if it was garbage id just toss it it was inexpensive enoughas soon as i got this i wanted to use it and prove to my wife why it was a waste of money and space and how even a review from an almost always dependable magazine could be wrong of course i tried some basmati rice because i knew that there was no way that i was going to get fluffy rice with discrete pieces of rice not stuck together once more i would show her who was rightwrongafter about  minutes when the machine said that the rice was done i opened the lid and behold it was perfect each grain of rice was perfectly cooked separate from all the other grains flowable and it was the same from the top of the pot to the bottom amazing and impressivethen i decided that the timetemperature etc of this gadget must have been designed for basmati rice lets try some shortgrain sticky rice for sushi damn how does it know again perfectim now a believer i admit i was very wrong and the answer to who needs a rice cooker is i do and you do this machine cleans up beautifully it leaves no rice on the bottom of the pot it is simple to use it cooks rice perfectlymy only issue with it is as per the attached photos it is very difficult to see the water line markings on the inside of the pot this machine is too good however to deduct any points for thattwo things to point out the cup that it comes with equals  of a dry cup measure it says that in the instructions but on the cup itself there is a  full mark thats a bit confusing but the measuring cup is  cup when it is filled to the top if you fill it to the  mark youre weighing out  of a cup or a little over  of a regular cup so just fill it to the brim there is a steam vent on the lid its probably not best to place this under a cabinet condensation will form on the underside of the cabinet and drip or worse penetrate the cabinet wood and get moldy keep it in a position so that the vent is clear of anything above iti highly recommend despite my previous insistence that nobody needs a rice cooker this machine its amazingreview of aroma housewares  cooked digital cooltouch rice grain cooker and food steamerseriously why would anyone ever need a rice cooker nothing is simpler than making rice"
4897,1,it is frustrating when get it out of the box and intend to use it with your  year old at the pool and it doesnt work it was a christmas present and just made it to swimming pool so sad i have contacted support but did not get a responsefirst time using it and it says lens obstruction
11016,4,i used the instructions that came with this and didnt work for me so i had to compensate and made my own instructions works just as describedmy own instructions
3512,1,the camera kept saying the sd card was not found when the sd card was in also wouldnt work off the charger but was as full batterysd card
12843,5,for the money this is the best rice cooker i have found it is slower than most especially its brown rice which is the only rice we make but it does a great job and the texture of the rice is perfect every time takes an hour and twenty minutes to cook two cups of raw rice which is about twice the time our old cooker took 
15747,5,i just made our first pot of rice with this last night it came out looking perfect and fluffy the rice came off the pot with ease and it also cleaned up really well the simplicity of the cooker makes it a huge plus i highly recommendfirst pot of perfectness
13681,4,"i am bad at rice i do not know why but unless its in a pouch i will screw it up i picjed up this tiny cooker the plain model no keep warm option and it has been amazing tips if you also suck at rice  rinse the rice a lotlike  or  times to keep the starch from sticking  only use a rice cup that it comes from and the recommended water lines in the pot its less than a full  cup so it matters  do not forget the wait time  mins after it pops dont touch the lidi have made sushi rice jasmine rice basmati rice long grain brown rice and rice combos all with the same process and measurements with no issues its not perfect but it is so much better nowidiot proof"
169,1,for those buying this product in the us please be aware that they camera is for the ukca market therefore you will not be able to register the camera with canon in the us and therefore will not be able to get the warrantee support etc other sellers on amazon do sell cameras for the us market it will be displayed at the bottom of the camera near the serial number sorry i didnt take a pic i already returned itnot an usa authorized product
2760,1, this camera is all plastic it came scratched the buttons feel so cheap if you watch the video they move the wrong way do not buy thischeap quality
9017,2,it seems like pretty good hardware the optics seem to be pretty good too its video quality is exceptional transferring the images should not be so impossible howevernice hardware impossible software
13383,5,easy useeasy use and working great
7902,1,super convenient small and prints fast but the print quality isnt great the color is off which isnt a deal breaker i kind of assumed they wouldnt be the highest quality pics but after about a week of having it every pic has lines down the side that really ruins the prints its never been dropped just used and set aside in a drawer so it isnt from the device being damaged id probably buy a different oneupdate quit working completely after a few months it makes noise like its printing and the photo never comes outehhhh
3359,1,after a couple of uses the battery would not charge brought another battery thinking it had been on the shelf awhile but it would not charge either too late to returnsecond device with battery issues
2692,2,i got this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it but it stopped holding a charge after we had it only a few weeks this is a poorly made productpoor quality
11554,4,didnt come with the veggie steamer basketnot bad
1253,2,considering this was a  camera i didnt expect much but the pictures are extremely yellow there is also a late capture time if taking pictures of infants do not get as by the time you take the picture of a cute moment you will not get the picture you wanted easy to use but do not recommendpay for what you get
10442,4,the rice measure cup was cracked but no big deal i use my own measuring cups ive made rice already i love jasmine rice so thats what i made as i always have some here  cup rice to  cups water to cook jasmine rice it was push one button easy and done quicker than my  year old rice steamer that this one replaced the rice came out absolutely perfect no sticking to pot at all ive always unplugged mine when its done or the heat will start to scorch the rice really glad i finally made this purchasegreat new rice steamer
12676,4,"i received this rice cooker today and got it all washed up and ready for dinner the one i bought makes   cups pre cooked rice which yields  cups of cooked ricei choose to make   cups of rice which yields  cooked cups of rice i measured out the  cups into the cooker then filled with water up to the  cup mark plugged it in and hit the button to begin cooking rice after about  min the rice went into warm mode i let the rice sit for about  min and the rice was perfect i went to go eat and forgot to unplug the cooker after about  min on warm mode the rice was just statting to burn on the bottom not bad enough that i wont still eat it thoughso far this has been a great little cooker for under  dollars only thing i would change is a shut down timer so it doesnt stay on but then again that would drive up the price updatehave used this cooker for  weeks now cleans easy makes great rice everytime i found a recipe for rice pudding that calls for  cups rice  cups milk dont try it in this rice cooker it will boil over other than that i have been having delicious rice several times a week update rice cooker is still going have just finished off the second  bag of rice since time of purchase has been a good purchase with no issues yet and simplified my rice cooking processrice cooking made easy"
10662,5,i got this because i have a habit of burning rice with this cooker i have great rice without the burnt flavor that i get without it highly recommendedgreat rice cooker
17646,5,overall a good rice cooker it stands for its brandgood buy
7657,1,incomplete package did not come with the film had no time to return as it was a giftincomplete
4767,1,i bought this and it stop working a  months after im so disappointed the power butting you have hold it for the light to stay ondont waste your money
17598,4,"zojirushi is a rop brand we only bought this to replace a  yr old sanyo rice maker that had a bowl all scratched my  yr old japanese mom still thinks the sanyo cooked better rice we found out that the rice bowl never would have gotten scratched if we washed the rice in a mesh strainermom was scrubbing rice in cooking pot with such vigor that it got scratched up shes using the strainer with the new rice cookerreplacing  yr old sanyo rice maker"
6304,2,i just reread the page and dont see perhaps its in fine print somewhere that hd video stops recording at  minutes  and apparently its common that dslr cameras cut off at  minutesi was unaware of this but its a nonstarter for me the quality of the video it does shoot is fantastic but its unusable to me if i have to keep restarting the recording every ten minutesdont buy if you need more than  minutes in hd
12825,5,this is the best rice cooker ive used in years rice cooker
11906,4,im not going to split hairs about a  rice cooker that has all of the features of a  rice cooker it did a great job of cooking just  cup of rice and an entire  cup batch of dried beans that i soaked for    issues  there seems to be no difference between stew and other settings it brings the content to a roiling boil  keeps it there i worry that this will over cook something set on a delay timer seems like its all or nothing  the interface is not intuitive i found the instructions lacking  cleaning the unit i discovered that when the lid is opened for drying water drained between the opening and the outer stainless surface layer i did immerse just the lid section to properly rince it you almost have to because of the non removeable seal great care needs to be taken to make certain water is completely drained by tipping the entire unit upside down for a while so water isnt drained into an area that could cause injury or damage the unit other rice cookers have a better design incorporating drainage away from  important points about an otherwise fantastic device
7070,1,the product isnt as it is shown for starters picture quality is completely terrible the video and picture provided for this product show clear and great quality photos that is not the case at allnot worth the money spent
8399,1,waste of money bought  packs right size but just loose papers not in case to place in cameradoesnt come in film pack box  doest work on instax cameras or liplay
3311,2,this product was very cute but the directions to set up were very confusing it kept telling me to insert a memory card and a battery which wasnt working the camera quality was glitchy not easy to take photosdont know how to use
8028,1,play video used it a month with no problem battery ran out a little quick but it didnt bother methen one day out of nowhere film just stopped existing i printed out the last film in a pack removed it replaced it nadaokay i said a little weird but maybe this packs screwed up some went through three other packs before the dreaded truth set in only a month and maybe  prints in and i kissed goodbye to  sliding down the drain for this little hunkajunkspare yourself and just print your photos out at your local drugstorelasted about a month
2971,1, after  minutes still no pictureafter  minutes no picture show
8087,1,unfortunately the outcome of the picture are really bad not what i expected from a polaroid camera really disfocus and blurryhorrible pictures
11348,5,cooks the rice for my family perfect i love that despite its smaller size it does cook enough rice i also use it to prepare my meal prep rice and theres enough to package  to  of my containers i love o can put a timer on it so it starts cooking my rice when im about  mins from getting off then i just start on everything else best partive owned a couple rice cookers this is by far truly the easiest to clean takes  effort awesome cookerlove this
4104,1,this system is not worth the money i gave it almost a year of trial and error with troubleshooting before writing this review from day one it was full of glitches including two cameras that were not working straight out of the box after a few hours of technical support that started with online directions and then phone calls it was determined that i was correct the cameras did not work they did replace the cameras eventuallyfirst of all the cameras are not reliable for detection no matter how you set up the cameras theres a  chance that it will detect anything at all the bonus is that when you set the sensitivity to the highest setting you will be alerted to every moth that flies by not an actual person though that appears to be too difficult the cameras lose contact with the wifi system even if you have the cameras  feet from the base stationdistance does not matter it just doesnt want to stay connected i have found the best way to reduce the chances of connection loss is to take down every camera yes get out the ladder and climb up to each one regardless of the weather and remove them from the system and then install them again only takes about  minutes per camera as i am getting better at this routine this needs to be done weekly so if you are going on a  week cruise youre not going to have working cameras halfway throughif the cameras do pick up motion it doesnt start recording for a good  seconds so whatever walked by the camera is no longer there unless the visitor is hanging around awhilethe lesson here for me is that you get what you pay for and apparently after sinking nearly  into this system bought  additional cameras the amount that i have to pay for a good system is beyond what im able to affordthis system is a joke the app to use it is not intuitive and i have spent plenty of time trying to adjust a setting or a camera in the hopes of working out all the glitches i have tried every recommendation from the company did my own troubleshooting for several hours only to end up with a junk unreliable system i gave it  months time to scrap it and search for a quality systemcomplete junklow quality and full of glitches do not buy
13690,5,purchased this for my fil so i wanted it to be very straightforward and easy to use the product worked great and simply has one button very easyeasy to use
14650,5,"fast and easy to usegreat for a mum like meeasy and quick"
10108,5,my last one like this never cooked brown rice without frothing n spewing out the vent making a mess and the rice stuck no matter how much or little water tossed it tgis one works well i wonder if the inside pot with a different coating is why it doesnt require huge amounts of extra water so far hasnt spewed out so much like the last so far tgis one cooks djrsnt stick and hasnt done too much spewing love iti like the inner pot it makes a difference
3317,1,it is very flimsy and the quality is very poor the pictures are fuzzy and just not worth the purchase my phone takes better pictires i just wanted a little camera for special moments but i may honestly go in the trash id return it but stupidly threw box awaynot a good purchase
2593,1,i bought  of these for my grand kids after  days or so the battery will not hold a charge for more than  seconds these are not cheap so be careful also film is not cheapcamera will not hold a charge after  days use
871,1,it never printed a single picture at all i bought it for my kids birthday and it was ruineddid not work
10639,4,it is the perfect size for me and my husband but when making a full cup of rice it tends to boil over a little sometimes its not major but still worth notingboils over easily if making the full cup of rice
12841,5,so far im satisfied with the product worked as described high quality material and easy to clean i just wished the cord is removable overall its a good rice cooker with a customized feature on how you would like to cook your ricegreat rice cooker
10443,5,this rice cooker is awesome i bought it as a gift for my daughter she says its easy to use and clean she is enjoying it very much and doesnt know how she did it until she got this rice cooker she prepares the rice and puts it in the cooker the cooker does all the work so if you want to make it easy on yourself grab this cooker today you will be happy you didgreat to have
17210,5,the cooker is really cool i love this shape and colorlooks cool and cute
5204,1,this camera worked just fine until the first charge ran out not it wont charge or turn on i can plug it in and turn it on but the functions dont work as soon as i unplug nothing works failure of a productdo not recommendstopped working after  charge
13033,5,"this is my first time using a rice cooker  so i cant compare the experience  however ive been missing outit features a digital touchpad with tons of options for your preferencesit also comes with several recipes  which boasts that this rice cooker isnt just for riceim excited to try the other recipes  but for rice and i can barely boil water this works so smoothly and effortlesslybest thing since sliced bread"
8435,1,the photos looked yellowish in color blurry and over exposed i wrote kodak and they said to run the color card through a few times that didnt work stay away from this printerbad quality pictures
4222,1,multiple buttons didnt work thought it would take good older looking pictures but it is only a kids camera the flash was just a light that stayed on not an actual flashkids camera
2572,2,we were given this camera as a gift my kids loved it but after charging the camera after it died the first time it will no longer turn ondoesnt work after charge
8760,1,none of our photos develop at all thought i did plenty of reviews and nothing works we tried inside outside and different lighting and nothing shows up would like a refundsucks
2240,2,its got bad sound qualityyo
4037,2,ive been waiting for either the price to come down or for a competitive product to come along for well over a year and i considered the blink model and actually had it in my cart for several months so when there was a price reduction on the arlo from  down to  i couldnt put off the decision any longer and pulled the trigger packaged very nicely and although the router is very light the camera is solid and has some heft to itmaybe because of the   batteriesi note that i have been in computers and communications and photography for over  years so such setups as this are usually not much of a challenge and indeed nearly everything went smooth as silk and yesterday i had the camera working using the iphone app and the web page i was gobsmacked when i learned i couldnt be signed on to both of them at once though thats insanely shortsighted although netgear pleaded security well give me an option to sidestep it then you can allow a guest to be on but the guest doesnt have access to all the settingsyesterday after thoroughly testing inside today i mounted it above my door and used the positioning mode to show a more realtime view than the normal live view so i could tell the scene the camera was seeing then i used the motion test mode so i could set the sensitivity slider to cover my yard but not the passing traffic so farfantastic rightbut when i got back inside i discovered the camera seemed to be locked into one of the test modes and there seemed no way to get out of those modes using either the app or the web app so i did what ive done a million times before rebooted the router and turned the camera on and off this didnt work so i took a more drastic stepi took the batteries out of the camera and reset the router back to factory and started over again which went well but still no luckthe camera was obviously locked into the test mode so i made my first mistakei called netgear support what a jokefirst they asked me who my internet provider was since i worked network support for decades i could follow the tier one csr train of thought herealways blame the customer first i told them i had a rock solid fiber connection but they didnt believe me and made me run speedtest next they didnt believe i had reset anything and made me do all that crap again i tried to escalate to someone with some sense but no luck they literally made me do exactly what id already done and then concluded that my camera was faulty despite me telling them over and over again that it was working fine up until i ran the tests and that i suspected their apps were at fault since no resets had fixed the problem again always distrust the customer first is the mottoso they said theyd send an rma and tried to get off the call but i made them stay on until i saw the terms and they were awful first i would have to pay  and give them a credit card if i wanted another camera in a reasonable time and then i would have to pay  to have ups pickup the old camera going back they refused to pay for the ups pickup even though i live  miles outside of town anyone who has ever dealt with an amazon return knows how customer unfriendly all this is and i told them rudely that id return it to amazon if i couldnt fix the problem and hung upand indeed within  minutes of getting off the call and experimenting some more with deleting the apps creating a new account and clearing cookies on the browser cleared everything up and the system is now running like a topas far as a camera review goes the quality is decent the angleofview seems well chosen and the motion detector seems to work fine i love the magnetic mount although ill need a more permanent solution as anyone can just pluck the camera right off and pocket it but im in a rural area and thats not as much a consideration as it could be the exposure is a little iffy in mixed sunshadow but it compromises fairly wellif this wasnt about netgears clown circus support it would get  starsnetgear support loses this item two stars
1886,2,nice camera but disappointed that the included batteries died before we could even take a picturebatteries we dead on arrival
6654,1,no battery backup at all after using it for  weeks the touch became horrible very slow response and everything started getting worser and worser videos are much worse than photos but i dont know how its a vlogging camera very badworst camera stay away from this
7358,1,this item does not work very well for serious artists the image projected is very small to work with it is difficult to adjust and overall poor performance we are producing studio artists and this is not a professional product we returned this and bought an autograph digital projector that is excellent for our purposesnot for serious artists
8647,1,photos are poor quality blurry grainywas expecting better from a name brandexpensive for such a low quality camerapoor photo quality
4073,2,i had high hopes for this camera i have a nasty neighbor who consistently does things like put garbage from the ditch on my front stoop moves my trash can and puts dog poop under it cuts across my yard when walking her dogs etc i was hoping this would allow me to record some of these things as proof should i ever need it i have a small property lot is  i installed one of these outside my front screen porch sunday so far its picked up every car that drives by ive gotten  alerts while writing this however it has missed me pulling into the driveway walking up to the house and entering the screen porch and only triggers and records the top of the screen door as it closed every time ive come home it missed the ups man dropping off a  box on my front stoop it also missed my neighbor mowing her and half of my yard and running over my landscaping lights on that side again thats about  ft from the camera it has also triggered many times by what i am assuming was the plants blowing around as there was nothing on the video recordingsit will kick in as i leave but im guessing its because the camera sits about  ft above the doorive adjusted the sensitivity and camera angles numerous timesive read a lot of reviews since sunday and have been on the halosupport site on arlo many times it says it does best catching a side to side movement but does poorly when motion is straight on it also mentioned creating rules with additional cameras so one would detect motion and signal the other to start recording the cost of adding an additional camera solely for that purpose isnt appealing to me i did try parking to the side of it about a  degree angles it still doesnt trigger or capture me pulling in ive walked super slowly towards it and nothingwhen i asked around about cameras this one was recommended by two people i know there are some positives i like the concept of wireless and battery operated as i know nothing about hard wiring nor is there a power outlet outside my porch to plug into the picture is excellent clear and crisp on the medium setting it has a very wide camera which captures almost my whole front yard if i want to live stream it it was super easy to install and set up the app is pretty simple but i had to click everything to figure out where the different settings werebut as i dont want to pay  just to be notified every time a car drives by ill probably be returning itdisappointed so far
17215,4,"because of limitations in my kitchen ive been using a crockpot slow cooker sanitary exclusively over the last year to aid in this unexpected pandemic journey ive accumulated a number of slow cooker cookbooks many recipes call for first sauteing on the cooktopthe appeal of this appliance is that sauteing can be done right in the applianceive used it twice in the short amount off time ive had it  once to make a glazed ham and another time for some bbq chicken legs i was pleased with the results both times i am incredibly happy with this cooker i think its going to replace my crockpot slow cooker i look forward to using it again in the next couple daysas others have mentioned the cast iron pot is heavy but not unwieldy the enamel interior surface is easy to cleanits one star less than perfect i wish the accompanying product guide had more recipes i wish it came with a second lid  a glass one i wish it came with something that would allow me to turn the lid upsidedown without scratching and with something to put in the upsidedown lid to have a small work surface when the instant dutch oven is not in use i wish the manual function was more intuitiveinstant dutch oven is the new and improved slow cooker"
3111,1,dont you love when you and all your friends pose for super cute photos and then wait for them develop just to see black boxes may neither absolutely terrible ive tried this with flash without it its just total garbagelost memories
13583,4,this is a decent way to cook small amounts of rice without needing to use a burner on the stove just be sure to follow the directions especially the part about rinsing your rice beforehand i had never done that before so the first time i just used my standard recipe for cooking rice and it didnt work very well with this cooker however after following the included directions it worked much better the second time even when following their included directions perfectly there is still some rice that is stubborn on the bottom when it finishes and some residue that needs a bit of light scrubbing with a soft sponge to come off but overall the rice comes out great and this is much easier to clean than any of the steel pots i would normally use for this purpose the manual also has directions for a few other foods but i havent tried it for anything besides ricedecent but not completely nonstick
7398,1,this camera sucks the old school was so much better and cheaper the film costs a fortune and turns out horrible we thought it would be fun and nice to have on the spot photos to share much better off just getting a photo printer and digital camerasave your money and get a digital
8063,1,i bought this camera twice and it stopped working after a few months each time i kept getting error code c and polaroid support was the worstno helpdoesnt work
9963,4,if you are cooking white rice then this is a very good tool but for cooking brown rice its a mess the foam goes everywhere also cooking white rice the water builds up around under the lid and does not dip to the drip tray fullynot for cooking brown rice
7219,2,wish it had adjustable velcro hand strapok
3446,2,very nice camera i ordered it for my wedding i hope it works as described but to my surprise it doesnt the photos come out in the middle of the paper or of different sizes the quality is not good and it lasts a long time to print i lost my money and i dont think it will work for my weddingcamara beautifil but doesnt works like said in description
5347,1,horrible bought two neither worked not even once complete garbage dont bother dont even think about itcomplete garbage
14346,4,i bought this on the prime day the rice cooker was at home has been used for many years there was deal for this cooker and i bought this one after choosing for a long time the rice cooked by this rice cooker is very fragrant and tastes good there are  people in my family and this rice cooker is just right dry rice porridge can be cooked which is much more convenienteasy to use
5500,2,so many cool features but one fatal flaw the picture and video quality is awful no joke my iphone  shoots better photos and videos than this camera the videos and pictures are pixelated noisy and grainy no where near worth  sad that companies these days are forgetting what the fundamentals of devices are and are putting to much effort into things that arent as important one example is this camera can remotely connect to your phone and you can control it from  meters away shutter iso etc but the image quality is awful what is the point of being able to remotely control a camera if it sucks it makes no sense the other funny thing is i was impressed with the microphone quality it is exceptional there is a touchscreen built in flash a great mic many shooting modes iso settings aperture settings filters an extensive menu a viewfinder panoramic mode and many more features why did you even bother adding amazing features if the camera itself sucksi wanted to like it
14191,5,this is a great rice cooker i brought it because it a must for me to bring it to my college its is easy to wash doesnt take up too much space and most importantly it has different mode of cooking i think it is worth the moneydifferent modes saves space and worth it
2862,1,focus is very poor audio quality extremely poorfocus is very poor when zoomed in audio is substandard external mike is a joke
10263,5,we eat rice pretty often this has made it easier to make and especially to clean up the measurements are a bit off for jasmine rice so i would recommend adding about  more than what it calls for cleans in minutes no major scribing even if left over nightvery easy to use
6830,1,i normally never write reviews even if a product is bad but this thing was so bad omg im just so sad because i got a brand new sd card for this and the camera took a few photos and saved them fine but the next week i took lots of christmas videos and pictures and none of them saved now everything i take a picture and try to look at it in the memories it says no files found im very sad and will be returning this product doesnt save pictures
4834,1,the camera was great when i first got it but it just stopped working for no reason  i checked the batteries and even watched tutorials on how to fix it  nothing worked thoonly worked for one day
5973,1,i bought this last year and it is already showing moisture in that screen next to the lens i put this thing in water just for a second and only a few inches under and got this super frustrating since i use it for videos for my business i called gopro and they said theres nothing they can do since they dont cover water damage thats ridiculousterrible
1048,1,low qualitybad product
4481,1,the swab left residue on the sensor i would not recommend buyingswab left residue
13462,5,the rice cooker does the job very nicegood size
733,2,read previous comments about the lens cover not staying on wellthey were right just completed a trip to alaska and fought that the entire time very frustrating i bought a similiar kodak camera years ago loved that camera but it decided to quit on me so i thought i was upgrading picture quality the entire trip was terrible finally gave up and used my iphone which produced much better picturesgo figure anywayspend a little more money and buy something differentnot a good purchase on my part
11985,5,"me a foodie dad in the usa who knows how to handcook longgrain sushi basmati jasmine and brown rice so theyre just right i rise early every morning to handmake lunches for my four children and my wife because im socially awkward and emotionally closed off and this is one way that i show my family that i love them im a middleclass working guy without tons of money so i dont buy  kitchen appliances on a whim i mean i bought my wife a kitchenaid mixer eight years ago because she wanted it but i winced at the price ive owned this product for five months and used it  times a week during that periodyou somebody that identifies with me and cooks rice or other steamed grains on a daily basismy review if youre pressed for time and you cook a lot of rice or other boiledsteamed grains buy this rice cooker i would give it more than  stars if i could its a triumph of convenience engineering and obviously a multiyear investment ive owned a couple  rice cookers which i used when i didnt have enough time to spare to pay attention to heaton heatoff cycles when i was making a meal now i just select the type of grain from a superintuitive menu select the time i want it ready and push a button the rice is always perfect when the beeper goes off and is still perfect the next daygeek details the ac power cord is flexible and retractable the clock doesnt need to be reset if the cooker is unplugged for  days at a time handy because the cooker doubles as an insulated container like a crock pot from which to serve hot rice several hours later the dual mode rice warmer  the superb design of the cooking chamber means that every time you cook rice you resterilize the sealed cooking chamber and keep it sterile so that rice can easily be held hot and safe for a second day the swingup handle makes this a cinch to carry and its wellbalanced the nonstick bowl is superheavyduty aluminum and i expect it to last for years especially since i baby it i love this appliance like a wall street ceo loves his sports car cleanup is easy never more than  minutes usually less than  with hot tap water and a splash of dish soap the detachable pot lid is easier to remove and clean than i expected i include detaching washing and replacing it in  minute cleanup timedisclaimer this is for the  cup cooker although i assume that the  cup cooker is similar ive never bought a more expensive model to compare my prior experience is with potcooking rice or using a  model when i didnt have time to baby the riceextras works great for wild rice and quinoa medium and shortgrain rice are perfectly cooked so long as you rinse them properly before putting them in the cooker if i fill and set the timer at bedtime i can season and cool the rice cut nori crab and avocado and make california rolls within  minutes from stepping into the kitchenupdate march of no change in my high recommendation i have used this ricecooker weekly for more than five years and it is still an a purchase no problems no malfunctions even with heavy usealso i fixed my original misspelling of avocado sorry about thatbento dad highly recommends"
14781,4,as the title of my review suggests there is one major and honestly stupid design flaw that keeps this rice cooker from being my all time fav there is no place to put the rice paddle come on thats so silly its a sleek red spaceship like design but you couldnt bother to design a holder or a place for the paddle seriously even the cheap  aroma rice cooker i used to own had a little handle you could stick the paddle in come on cuckoo this is ridiculous another minor design flaw that isnt as bad but is inconvenient is how hard the lid flips up  the force of the lid flipping up even with a full pot of rice is so strong the whole rice cooker jerks backwards a little bit so you have to keep your hand on the lid and then press the lid open guiding the lid and not letting it just flip freelyone stupid design flaw that keeps this from being a perfect rice cooker
15243,5,i have not used it yet but have a small cooker i got  years ago at marcs closeouts section i use this on a regular basis i wanted a bigger one to make yogurt cant wait to try it it is very nice looking and seems pretty straight forwardmy first large pressure cooker
8623,1,this camera says batteries included they were not the set up screen directs you to press buttons this camera does not have we are struggling to even figure out the basics and havent even been able to use it yet ridiculously unclear unhelpful manual weve wasted a lot of time just trying to do basic things disappointing and dont advertise batteries included when they arent it makes it look like youre scamming peoplethis camera is disappointing so far
6914,1,i cant use it anymore the lens cover no longer auto retracts when you turn it on it doesnt even fully cover the lens when turned offlens cover stopped retracting after less than a year
13662,5,"i struggled to decide whether to get the  cup or  cup version for just my wife and myself in addition to small amounts for side dishes she sometimes makes a stir fry or other meal that requires a full bowl of rice for each of us i was concerned that the larger model wouldnt really work well for the small amounts one cup or less or that the  cup wouldnt make enough for full bowlsour  cup cooker arrived yesterday and i did a test batch using  cups uncooked white rice using their measuring cup that amount was just the right amount for a full dish for  or even abit more than needed  cups would certainly leave leftovers the rice came out perfect i left it covered in the cooker for  more after it stopped and then fluffed it with a plastic cooking fork any stickiness dissipated as it cooled very happy with this unit and the  cup model definitely enough for  adults"
17040,5,"this came out at a time when i was actively looking for a slow cooker i didnt really use a slow cooker before but i was interested in trying simple recipes where you can just add ingredients in the morning and then have dinner ready without further prep being busy with work often this sounded like a great option to have availablei am glad this came out at that time and that i chose it it has lived up to and exceeded my expectationsthis is a very versatile cooking machineslow cooker  i think it works like any other slow cooker just press the slow cook button or set a custom temp and come back in    hours for a nice hot mealsearing plus slow cooking  this is a bit of gamechanger and a lot like the instant pot you can set the temp to high in order to sear meats in the pot first and then lower the temp for slow cook i sear and saute meats and veggies first and then set to slow cook all in one pot and all very quicklyyou can also simply use this as another burner when you are using all of the burners on your stove i use it to simmer sauces while cooking other things on the stovethe controls are simple to use and very intuitive also the control screen is just a glossy surface very easy to cleani also love that i have an extra cast iron pot that i can use in the oven and stove like i mentioned before very versatile productlast but not least it comes with rubber handles and place mat to pick up the hot pot and set it down on the counter nice touchesi have this and my instant pot right next to each other and use them both about  times a week to make various meals for my family they are workhorses and i view them as my dynamic duo they work well and save me timevery useful and versatile cooking toolhighly recommend"
14904,4,love the rice cooker very fast on getting it ready would order a aginawesome
6902,2,i purchased this camera to take on our upcoming honeymoon the camera worked a few times but after only a month and three uses the lens got jammed internally i watched multiple videos on how to fix this on my own but the camera is still no longer working amazon will no longer accept returns though this product is still basically brand newim super bummed and disappointed the fujifilm instax company has been contacted but as of right now no help or exchanges are availableonly worked for a month
1347,1,did not come with battery nor card so basically unusable as is seems you have to purchase card and battery separately which makes no sense so bewarebattery and card not included
8840,1,i bought this to take to alaska before going i wanted to try it out just playing around at home i got an error message about the sd card not being formatted and would be unable to use the camera turn on and off did not immediately fix the issue but eventually it did start again i hoped it was a fluke although i had read a review stating the same problem a week before trip at a party taking nice photos tried to turn camera back on to take another photo and message came up nothing i did would get the camera to work this morning as i am packing it up to return it seems to work this is not a reliable product i am returning itunreliable
3567,1,it looked perfect but i checked on the battery and it looked as if it was usedit didnt turn on
13250,2,very nice but not for small apttoo big for me
17017,5,easy cleanup heats quickly cooks whole mealsears and cooks all in one pot
7400,1,previously i had a fujifilm instax square camera and i was very happy with it for two years but then my camera broke i bought this one as a replacement and before it arrived i thought id made a good upgrade because it looked better than my original fujifilm camera from an aesthetic perspective but now i think nope  every single photo has come out with terrible quality i am so incredibly disappointed  the quality is so awful so terrible that i am thinking of going back to polaroid do not buy this camera its all stylistic design and zero qualityterrible terrible photo quality
8525,1,well i loved it the first time i used it but then it started doing this thing where the display showing the  of polaroids left kept blinking and no matter what i did to troubleshoot the issue the camera just stopped functioning i didnt drop it didnt spill on it or anything like that the film was brand new the battery was charged and there was no reason for it to have stopped working the very first time using it unfortunately i think ive waited too long to post about this but i just wanted to warn others of this blinking display issue where the camera just stops working without cause very disappointing considering what i paid for itblinking display  nonfunctioning camera 
9872,5,works great love it great machine 
9266,1,low pixel and poor quality photos even with additional lighting would not recommend for even for a childvery poor quality

16458,5,"i freaking love this rice cooker you can make fresh rice every day in like no time and you dont have to be all crazy about making portions and storing or freezing or whatever thats right fresh rice steam it throw it on a plate add a fried egg some stir fried veggies and a sliced tomato and you have a healthy cheap and easy meal even for those of us that lack planning skills discipline or time rice is bad for you well no worries i make a tasty kickass mix of quinoa and rice quinoa rice and orange egyptian lentils or just amazing quinoa that steams just like my grandmassteam quinoa you can use as a base for salads stews porridges that will blow your mind i hear one can even make your stell cut oates in it havent tried that yeti am a total slacker with doing dishes but there is something about the little potpart of this rice cooker soooo easy to clean like soak for few minutes is water and tadaaaaahhhh grab the sponge and that is that i mean it even encourages me to do the rest of the rest of the dishesi am so sad that i have to leave this little guy behind because i am moving overseas i wish i had found this  years ago like a butterfly effect i am sure my life would be even betteronce in a while i feel like i want to put it in my back pack and take it to the lab and i only loose my drive of doing so because i get selfconscious and i fear people my think it is weirder than usual to steam rice at workyou know how people go through bouts of depression and get a dog and it is therapeutic and they feel better well in my case this little rice cooker was like therapy during a depression spell probably the only clean thing in my house and just the joy that even if i did not want to stand up from bed i knew i could still manage a warm mealdo not underestimate the healing power of warm rice and a fried eggso go ahead and get onethis rice cooker warm my heartget the pun  "
3560,1,camera turned itself on and off randomly could hear it beeping in the other end of the house in the middle of the night gets hot real easy i was afraid to ship it back with the battery in it even though it came to me that way screen froze so bad that i had trouble even getting the camera turned off bought the media mod accessory separately to rig an external mic and couldnt get that to work either even after a couple of hours online and on the phone with tech support manually updated the firmware at their instruction and it did nothing tech support is a joke gopro has really taken a nosedive since my hero 
3854,2,my cell phone takes  better photosits not a good camera dont waste your time
4111,1,i bought these cameras  i was attracted to the small size the seeming good battery life but most important they were wireless with motion sensors it has taken me until july of  to give this product a wholeheartedly buyer beware do not buy keep in mind i bought  in rechargable batteries to go with my new christmas gift to my house the word that would sum up these cameras is sketchy and thats sketchy at best you cant rely on these  the base station needs to be restarted at least once a month because it shows offline even when your home network and internet connection on other devices are working fine and when the basestation is showing offline when you know it shouldnt the cameras are down you will not open your app everyday to ensure your cameras are online so if so happens you dont need to look at them for a month then your system could have been down that entire time since you last looked at it because the basestation needs to be be hard reset that means it doesnt do it on its own what if your house got broken into and you have all your doors covered so you can just review your footage so you will have something to give to the police you open your app and notice your basestation was offline for  days also see the picture i posted with the basestation showing all greens  the motion sensor on this thing is also subpar i have toyed with the sensitivity on this thing til my heart is content and it just doesnt preform like it should see one of my pictures where i purposely waited until it was dark and walked to see where the motion sensor activated the camera well you can see by the picture it activated when i was almost past the camera like how does this happen and obviously i knew the camera and was looking up so it got a glance of my face but i am pretty sure if that was a bad buy heshe yes i assumed your gender would not be looking up at that time and would have walked by undetected come on man we need reliability and dependability with a security systemso i ask you what good is this thing i am beyond disappointed and obviously i am out my money very bad experience overalli really wanted to like this product and take no pleasure in making this review
9417,5,my girlfriend wanted a rice cooker so i bought this one for us its amazing wash the rice throw it in and it comes out prefect every timeamazing products
10251,5,"this is by far the best purchase i have made this year i have struggled to make rice on the stove for years and while i like using my instapot it can be too big of a hastle to pull out and cleani order a lot of hello fresh meals and i can cook the preportioned grains in this rice cooker perfectly with the amount of water on the recipe card i have also used the regular ratios for rice i have at home with no issuesthe inside pot and steamer tray are easy to clean in the sink and i have ran both through the dishwasher multiple times without issuesive cooked white rice brown rice quinoa couscous and bulgur with no issues even when i get fancy and add in seasonings or nuts to the grains while cooking specific recopies i have steamed a lot of veggies in it tooi live alone and cook for one but i think you could easily prepare grains for four people with it plus the size is so easy to storebest purchase of "
8593,1,dont waste your money on this productvery cheaply made
10291,5,rice cooker is perfect no stick and the best is the chimes when rice is ready i love itgood rice cooker
8174,2,had to return it as it didnt have image stabilization kinda required in an action camera replaced it with a  camera with the same resolution but with image stabilizationwould be an excellent camera if it had image stabilization
8992,1,didnt work had to return itmalfunctioned
5498,2,if youre buying this camera so you can transfer your photos via wifi to your smartphone do yourself a favor and look elsewhere the app required to do this is garbage it crashes constantly on both my ipad and my android phone first it says its connected then it says not connectedpanasonic should not be advertising a feature that is painful and highly unlikely to work i think ill stick with my old canon rebel and send this back the immediate transfer to smartphone was a big selling feature to meforget wifi
9523,5,i made a pancake out of it lol freaking love iti so love it
12220,5,it worksjust like the one i previously purchased in japan  years ago
520,1,the batteries were missing from the box the camera was returnedwhere were the batteries
2336,1,camera was fun while it lasted but once the battery ran out and we attempted to recharge it we cant get it to power on a red light illuminates when plugged to the charger but even after  hours the camera wont power on waste of money and my daughter is super bummed out broke almost immediately
7917,1,dont waste your money on this product the hp sprocket is better the software on the kodak printer is horrible if you add textframes and decide you want to adjust it after the fact it wont let you when you finish printing a picture the gallery takes you back to the beginning of your photo album so if you were looking for specific pictures from  years ago you now have to scroll all the way back down again the printer loses connection after every  prints when it runs out of paper you have to reprint the last picture rather than it printing when you reload overall i will just return this item and go with what i know worksget the hp sprocket instead
3499,1,this camera is nothing but trouble i bought one for the school where i work so the students could take pictures in front of a photo wall for st patricks day the camera did not work properly from the beginning i checked the manual over and over and we were doing everything correctly finally it started to work before our event and lasted for about  photos then it started printing doubles and then none at all also after opening the paper cartridge to check that it was loaded which it was the back part would not snap back on i would like a refund so the class budget can be reimbursed were a public school and its not like we have money to spend i would have just returned it but id purchased the combo and we used about  picture sheets hopefully someone reaches out to reimburse i expected a lot more out of a brand like kodak very disappointingneed a refund
2039,1,cant take a photo of a darkskinned person in any kind of light or background the whole thing comes out darknonexistent picture quality
8973,2,this is not the minolta company you may think it is its a knockoff that likely will not service or repair this fake when neededfake minolta product from china
1794,1,almost every picture i took it was too bright and the picture wouldnt show just printed white the camera fell off the table in its case and completely stopped working trashdoesnt work
8060,1,far too expensive of equipment to not eject  a shot film very saddened by the qualitybroken and wouldnt eject film
5352,2,it doesnt work with rechargeable batteries i tried several brands eneloop as well it uses a lot of battery  x aaa gone in  of use and yes the kids are always playing with it but that is the purpose of the camera maybe i have been unlucky with this camera 
3981,2,only half of the film developedonly half of film developed in each box
17244,5,i bought one for each of my daughters who are starting out in  professional jobs in co  ny they are novice cooks they were having varied levels of success cooking rice in covered pan they are happy with their cooker consistent rice every time photo is of broth being cooked in base and steamer insert being used to cook baby bok choy at same time the only thing to watch is less time for less than full pot of ricecan overcook smaller quantitieseasy to usemultipurpose
7124,2,you can tell its very poorly made plastic is very brittle and breakable not very good material mine arrived broken and shatteredextremely flimsy and cheaply made
10390,5,machine is great but why did i get it with an expired coupon inside its from over a year ago keep your product up to date or keep extra crap out of box frustratinggood rice cooker
11177,5,great for cooking enough for one persons  meals just set it up with your food choices and let it be it keeps the food warm until you disconnect it so make sure to disconnect when done i have not used frying pans in a while after purchasing this product worth every pennyi love this product
2416,1,this was disappointing it kept freezing on the screen so we would have to plug it in restart it etc to try to get it to take pictures again and the picture quality was horrible dont buyhad to return kept freezing
2258,2,it didnt come with a charger and it was asking for tf card we didnt have and if we did we wouldnt know where it world go quite complicatedtrue beginners camera
15817,5,"moosum rice cookerpros great for small quantity cooking perfect for  cups of uncooked rice small and portable very easy to travel with quick cooking process for rice easy clean upcons nonegreat for smaller quantities"
12902,1,we attempted to cook rice a basic function of this machine and after  tries it never did cook the rice not sure if this particular machine is defective but i dont need the aggravation so returned for a creditdid not cook rice
5513,2,the  megapixel photos are about the same quality as my last cameras  photos the sensor on this camera introduces a lot of noise at relatively low isos the camera is also somewhat noisy due mostly to the image stabilization but still makes noise even when that is turned offthe wifi features are good but the ui behind them still needs work and is a bit slow for certain mundane tasks like uploading all the photos to a computer it does support smb shares so that is a plus if you run linux controlling manual aperature shutter speed and focus still require going into a menu so there is no fast way to control thosethe  videos come out alright but for anything action based you will still want  since the  can be painful if whatever your shooting is moving aroundthe wifi features are good but the ui behind them still needs work 
1638,1,the image quality is extremely low and doesnt match what is advertiseda camera that works but isnt worth the price
1699,1,just use ur phone u will get a better picture or footagebad
1952,1,i have several camcorders at various levels of quality i had purchased this camera for my wife so she could use it for video blogging and youtube i decided to test it out and was i ever disappointed i tried  at both  and  fps the video was not crisp at all with good lighting bringing things closer to the camera would not autofocus leaving them blurry and i did a sound recording test using the built in mic which came out sounding terrible i record a lot of video and do video editing and producing daily and even for what my wife needs a camera for which is much less demanding this camera falls seriously short i will be looking for better options unfortunately in this case i guess at  we got what we paid forpoor quality video for  auto focus is pretty much nonexistant
4322,1,this camera bag is horrible the design is incredibly poor and renders it useless my cannon  does not fit well with the  lens on and the  lens only fits securely in the top pouch seen zipped shut in the picture that looks oh so securely packed with a camera body and  lenses i purchased it to take my camera on vacation as it is a backpack design bad choice if you unzip this bag without removing it and laying it flat on a table or the ground all items will fall out  what a ridiculously poor design to have the zipper compartment open sideways my big lens fell out onto the ground the icing on the cake  not a comfortable wear do not purchase this bag i am upset that i threw away my moneypoor design
9144,1,although at first this feels heavy and youll think its going to be decent its not i thought mine was just taking crappy pictures the first day i bought it and an hour in i saw the front lens was either scratched or broken i requested a return the same day i opened the boxpoor quality
1655,1,not worth the purchasehorrible
3591,1,doesnt work with out a phone perioddoesnt work with out a phone period
11335,5,i never knew what a game changer a rice cooker could be i used to think that i just didnt really like rice but with this rice cooker that has totally changed all you do is measure and rinse the rice add water there is a line that tells you exactly how much choose your rice type and hit start i set mine for an hour and  minutes and the rice turned out perfect im so happy with how well this rice cooker works  i love the colora kitchen staple
3381,1,disappointed in the quality felt more like a toy than an actual camerawouldnt purchase again
16493,4,this review is for the bd  cup rice cooker its my first rice cooker never really saw the point of buying a dedicated device for something so easy to make with a pot on a stove but i find its very handy makes just the right amount for a family meal or for one person over a few days the cute little pot fits easily in the fridge to hold the leftovers its nonstick and easy to clean i suggest using a touch more water or less rice than what the guide indicates otherwise the rice will be a little hard also theres no alarm  you have to listen for the popup sound like a toaster and theres no off switch the device has to be unplugged after use that last issue prevents me from giving it  stars but overall its a great buy for the moneycute practical worth the price
1684,1,when i got the camera i charged the batteries that it came with and started playing around with the settings to learn how to work the camera i put in my ring light to see how the quality looks with the ring light and when i started to record the camera was not reading the sd card i literally used the camera for  minutes before it was unable to read the sd card i was so excited about this camera because of the reviews that i was seeing the quality isnt allthat great but then for the sd card not to read super disappointing definitely returning this not worth the money not worth the money
6154,1,i thought with the price i paid that i would be getting a good picture quality but i was wrong tried multiple settings but all the pictures werent to the greatest quality i was expectingnot worth it
11307,1,worst rice cooker

8335,1,the view screen broke on the second daygame overcheap junk
12022,5,"better than all the resti love using this thingsimply the best"
5626,1,bought this in june for a trip in september used it for about a dozen photos before the monitor stopped working without being able to see what you are taking a photo ofpretty uselessstopped working after a few minutes
8789,1,it doesnt take a photo while pressing the button it takes a very long time and then the photo is blurry i dont recommendnot what i expected
6973,1,it worked great for about a month but now every time i turn it on the lens will open and then immediately go back in and shut have not been able to fix it after changing batteries replacing film etcmy camera stopped working about one month after receiving it
10570,5,the size is just right for  or  people by far the most useful gadget i have bought in the last decade absolutely recommend everyone gets onebest add on to any kitchen
2616,1,received package but only received  film sheets when  film sheets should be includedmissing film
5287,1,i have to return it as the viewfinder electronics do not work the camera might be a lemon but it is frustrating to returndoesnt work
8829,1,even photos taken in bright direct sunlight are underexposed on cloudy days the camera is entirely useless and dont even try using it indoors while i really do like contrasty punchy film this goes too far all the shadows are the deepest darkest black and there is no detail whatsoever instax cameras take far better pics in bad conditions than this camera takes in perfect conditions its cute it feels good in your hands its relatively portable but it takes horrible pictureswhats more it didnt last a year the battery stopped charging and this model has the battery inside of the camera not in the film pack so i wasted over a hundred bucks on a piece of junk that cant take good photos and doesnt even last a year before its dead im not impressed avoid this guy and find something better like one of those gasstation disposable film cameras from the  an old disposable camera will take better pictures on longexpired  film than this camera takes brand new out of the box and that  camera will actually still work if you leave it sitting for a few months the polaroid go wontpolaroid stop horribly underexposed photos and it stopped charging in a year
14478,4,"very convenient for making rice cleanup was easyprepared the rice for frying great choicevery nice"
15535,4,does it cook rice when instructions are followed yes thats pretty much all you could ask for from a rice cooker does it have advanced features no it could benefit from a brighter light while in cook as its hard to see if its on from a far when the cook light turns off there should be a beep or something to let you know its shifted into the keep warm setting overall an easy to use rice cooker for basic needs and to start funny kitchen as it says on the recipe bookstart funny kitchen
4137,2,if your getting this for a kid its fine but the image quality didnt match the description or photos shown our phones took significantly better photospoor image quality
2607,1,it only came with  film pack everything else work great just sucks it other  film pack wasnt theremissing item
9204,1,i was looking for a better way to take indoor pictures of items and based on some of the reviews i thought this camera was the answer well i was wrong it takes worse pictures than the camera i was hoping to replace it with and i regret having wasted my money on this less than merely adequate replacement my search continues very disappointed in this camera
17733,1,"so i have a really old  years probably sanyo micron style rice cooker the sanyo will make perfect rice the issue with it is its a  cup rice cooker and the minimum amount of rice you can cook is  cups dry for our family  of the time that is too much so i started looking for a smaller rice cooker and i loved the size of this thing i just cook just  cup of rice when it was just me i also heard zojirushi are the best so i ended getting a descent deal on this on black friday and picked this upso from the start i was disappointed when i first looked at the box the disappointed started this was made in china and i thought all zojirushi machines where made in japan it wouldnt have been that big of a deal just as long as it made perfect rice but it didnt more on that later so i used it about  times and the rice it cooked was very wet and mushy i would say the rice cooking from my old cheap black  decker popup style rice cooker is superior but not that great either for all my testingcooking i used member mark long grain rice no matter what quantity of rice i used the results were the same so the  job of one of these rice cookers is to make perfect rice  this fails miserablythe other small issue was how slow it was micron style rice cookers in general take a lot longer to cook the rice but this thing is the slowest cooker ive ever used to cook long grain white rice it takes  minutes again it wouldnt have been that that big of an issue for me just as long as the rice was cooked perfectly and ive already described how that turned out  it does have a quick settings that i never used so i dont know how much faster that would have been but i think the rice would have even been worsesomeone i was chatting with told me i need to mess with the watercook time no way im not going to spend timeeffort trying to do this because these are made for shortmedium grain rice and i was using long grain rice this is a micron style rice cooker and it should auto sense everything you should only have to measure the rice with the provided cup rinse the rice until the water runs clear  fill the water the the provided cup on the inside of the pot for a rice cooker that cost this much it should be smart enough to figure out how to make long grain rice correctly and i did use the water line for long grain rice granted this is not zojirushi most expensive rice cooker the induction models being more expensive but this this is the next expensive lineso in the end i shipped it back to amazoni end up buying a much cheaper until from costco a tiger  cup  it was no only much cheaper but it made superior rice the tiger unit made perfect white rice and i didnt have to mess with any settings granted its not perfect but i really liked it and i much prefer the size of the zojirushi but  job of one of these rice cookers is to make perfect rice and if it cant do that i dont want it it was almost much faster it took about  minutes not on the quick setting to make the rice it was also made in japan even though it was much cheaper the small issues with it if anyone is looking at this model were the size it only shows how much time is left to cook the rice until the last  minutes the zojirushi shows almost from the time you press the start button probably the biggest issue i had with it it didnt have a retractable cord non replaceable batter but non of these expensive rice cookers have replaceable batteriesi heard zojiushi was the best and this was a total disappointment"

9272,4,for me personally if i dont add too much water then it cooks rice perfectly ive also used the steamer to steam green beans in it before and that came out ok itll usually cook the rice for about  minutes before itll switch to keep warm mode the instructions will tell you to leave it that way for a few more minutes to improve the texture pretty simple and automated processcooks rice pasta etc pretty well decent at steaming
16227,5,rice cooks perfectly fits in a smaller space value purchase stop making yourself wet or dry rice and use thiseasy to use and really works
4412,2,i bought a frame in  and my mom loves it the app is very easy to use and send pics over i bought my mom a new frame in  i was hoping for an easy connection between the frames  email accounts later each frame is registered under a different multiaccount normally a mistake is  button click nope maybe a search of how to deregister the miss registered frame nope maybe  or  emails from customer service with an easy fix nope i am on day  and email  and still cant unregister it they cant do it they say click the dustbin button to deregisterno such icon available maybe in the instructions nope zero room for mistakes but they do email back quickly they dont have answers that work but they do email back if you want mulit frames choose a different company that links them up with easeimpossiable to l deregister if a mistake is made

6485,2,i purchased  of these lights and pleased with the size temp control and brightness control however the battery does not last more than  minutes even when the indicator shows fully charged i use these lights for work and need a reliable light that stays lit for the duration of an interview often less than  minutes the lights are used at approx  capacity but even then they do not work for me i would not recommend these lights to anyone who is concerned with reliability of useshort battery life  not more than  minutes

12740,5,i am a huge fan of cosori air fryers so when i saw that they were dipping their toes into the rice cooker arena i thought why not i cooked some steel cut oats in it when i took my first bite i realized what i had been missing their rice cooker brought out the rich nutty flavor of the oats my point is that this is more than just a rice cooker you can cook all kinds of dishes in it you can saute slow cook its easy to use and cooks food to perfection it also keeps food warm without drying it out once again cosori nails itjust buy it
3933,2,item broke after  months  very little use  didnt drop or abuse no support no offer to replace  great looking kit just very dissatisfied with the time it worked  still sits on shelf in bag hoping ill find someone who can fix it nice looking product  didnt last

5230,1,man im disappointed in the quality i purchased  of them and the quality is trash they are also not kid friendly to use at all you have to press  different buttons to get to the camera or picture only reason im not returning them is because i have already given them to my nieces but they are not worth the money spent at allvery poor quality definitely not  maybe 
4167,2,does not get bright at all and turns off after being fully chargednot great
14175,5, this little rice cooker is great its cute and functional i recently started watching what i eat and paying more attention to my foodand decided i should get a small rice cooker then i found this little guyits perfectsmall enough i can cook my own portion of riceand still big enough i can make enough for  peoplemy rice always comes out perfect nowits also very simple to usei appreciate how fast it cooks tooits also very easy to clean the non stick helps a lotand being ceramic i dont worry too muchoverall i am happy so fargreat little rice cooker
5346,1,this is a piece of crap it requires a memory card which we purchased and then my excited  year old tried using it in the water and it broke within minutes do not buy this unless you want to disappoint your childm
1232,1,sd card that it came with says not compatible i have to format the card every time i turn it on just super annoyed i have to figure out what sd card goes with this meaning spending more moneysd card
7027,2,scratched my sensor  be careful using them i did every step and left a scratchsensor scratched
6912,1,this camera is easy to use but the picture quality is terrible i love my insta evo hybrid if only they made it to hold larger film the wide  is on its way back to amazonbuy the fujifilm instax evo hybrid
16345,4,i havent had a black and decker product for awhile i know they are reasonable in price and quality can be fine longevity is sometimes a issue i really like the black and decker rice cooker it works just fine cooks fast amd hasnt been inconsistent ive used it like a small hot boilercooker and plan to keep trying more stuff in it to be exact ive basically cooked only rice but also pasta and chicken wings plus ive done rice casseroles beef bouillon cream of mushroom out of a can garlic rice quick jambalaya butter milk w italian herbricearoni in the past called it creamy italian and even made a reduced mushroom medley confit as a sauce prior to making some plain rice ive used it a decent time now and ive also gotten off track i got the thing for  on salei think some of the best sale prices you can get for a similar size is  range those prices doent happen often and  was good last things are the size is fairly small best for a single person really if your cooking for more then  definitely think about getting a larger size you might want a larger size anyway since it is still basic and fairly small my only other concern is longevity as i mentioned before sometimes black and deckers are known to not work for the long run ill have to seeperfectly good rice cooker
10340,5,you cook rice on a stovetop but using a rice cooker is ideal just wash rice set and forget no way youre overcooking or burning your rice that way you can focus on preparing the rest of your mealmakes cooking easier
10521,5,im a  year old that likes ease of use great to make rice and oat meal perfect for one person and so easy to cleaneasy to use
9244,2,picture quality sucks and doesnt print colored picturespictures are not clear at all and only print out black and white
8156,2, dont know what happened to begin with the camara its a  star resolution will work for any type of accident proof not recommended for riding memories second this is the second memory card i put on it i dont know why it eventually just burns it or idk lastly im from san diego and i use this camara for about  weejks ago for  days in the rain and then it stop working it records all my riding fast forward even when i downloaded them into my phone worst camara i have ever bought o by the way this is a one year updatedread
6211,2,the best thing i can say about this rain coat for the camera is that its cheap it does keep the camera dry but i have a hard time actually using it while its in this rain cover a big black garbage bag would do the job as well and much cheaper i do carry a couple of garbage bags in my camera bag anyways they come in handy if you are out in the woods and want to collect the garbage that your fellow citizens leave behind or to cover a camera when it starts to raini did get a microfibre cloth with the rain cover which comes in handy every now and thendoes not work for me
1257,1,took it to sstore to fix it and said it was un fixabledoesnt
9981,5,"so far so good i havent had any major issues from it its  quartsso its perfect for cooking just remember to wash your rice thoroughly before cooking i would recommend this producti would recommend this product"
9182,1,garbage product all plastic case  drop and it would be destroyed battery lasted for  hour if you need flash you will need to wait  seconds between pitures for flash to be ready photo proview on screen is distorted due to lousy screen quality charging cable is from  why not make camera charging port with usb c to get sd card and battery out you need tiny fingers or a small screw driver to be able to reach release tabs garbagespend a few more dollars and buy a well know camer brand this thind is not worth  much less 
2115,1,not only did i not receive multiple film packs like the description the cameras hardware itself is broken leaving it unusabledoesnt work
5604,2,the quality is not as good asmake sure to read
6997,2,used once went to use it again and it wouldnt turn on tried different batteries but no luck waste of money and now i have a bunch of wide instant film i cant even use ive purchased fujifilm instant film cameras before and they are still going after years of a lot of usewarning
10141,5,this rice cooker has many functions but i only use it to cook rice the price is the lowestcook rice
714,1,i only purchased this camera because of the flip screen as a vlogger its important to have but when i recorded something then watched it video did not play in real time it was in slow motion although if you took the sd card out it was fine this is not good when you want to vlog immediately best for very young children to start vlogging but im sure their cellphone has a better camera anywaydont buy sharpness of pictures are poor
965,1,this camera refuses to work with windows it keeps claiming to be open in a different app even if not are running uvc and this camera are not compatiblei got it to work for a little bit but it will randomly drop recording but since posting this reps have been trying to bribe me to remove my reviewi hope you dont plan using this as a webcam or for streaming
11983,5,it takes about an hour to cook white rice my older version rice cooker use to only take  mins it also doesnt have the line inside for the water level for one cup of ricenot bad
7202,1,the clip on the top came loose the first day i used it and my camera fell the lense and the screen broke not sure if the sensor got damaged  would not recommendstrap came loose the first day i used it
14434,5,i have been using this cooker for several times now and the rice is cooked perfectly tastes good much better than the cuisinart one i had before nice design the only cons is that the inner pot capacity is smaller than it supposes to  i usually cook  cups of uncool jasmine rice and is a little bit less than  cups cooked rice under the  max mark inside the pot i am pretty sure it cant be  cups cooked rice overall i like this rice cooker very much no doubt with products made in japangreat purchase
4012,2,item came in an open box accessories were all around the box this was clearly used and returned before shouldnt be advertised as a new itemitem not new
9659,4,"i damn near cooked everything in this neat little pot my only gripe is how it turns on based on weight so if you tried to cook something that isnt heavy enough like bacon for example it wont cook without you holding down the pot with the lidif youre only using this for rice youll be aight it never burns its so so goodi know my ra is sick of me "
14862,5,"fast delivery works great and is easy to cleani highly recommend itgreat rice cooker"
6632,1,the camera is not working it sends notifications telling me to turn it off and then turn it on again but every time i turn it on it sends me the same notification i try to contact the seller but no answer i lost my moneyterrible

16856,5,no mess easy to tuck away easy to clean fast and perfect every single time i didnt want to spend a lot on it and now i wish i would have bought it many years agowhy did i wait so long to buy this its was worth every penny
3175,1,i went for this unit because information available on the dual sim version indicated coverage on all networks and all carriers i have tmobile service here on  at  bars of service and tmobile  at  bars this dual sim camera version will not work on tmobile nothing i have perfect service on my cell phone and use a hotspot for my home internet i think the camera would be great if it did what was advertised but it doesnt look for a different solution if you absolutely need tmobile going to try to send these back for a refunddoes not work with all carriers
17283,5,i went back and forth as to whether or not i wanted to get this appliance my electric stove is really not working well so i purchased the instant electric dutch oven as an alternative until i can get a new stove i braised some beef chuck and it was amazing i also purchased this with bread proofing in mind it works great for that toothis is a keeper
12284,5,its definitely made for sushi rice if using white rice is still comes a little sticky wont recommend if only making  cup of rice at a time but the warming is really nice takes about an hour to cook rice love the singing at the endefficient sushi rice maker
17138,5,"dont have to pot watch cooks great looks great easy controlswaited a year to buy it on sale after buying my first le creuset dutch oveni still have to learn how to regulate the heat on my le creuset but i dont have to learn how to use the instant dutch oven  even if the electronic parts of the instant dutch oven go out one day ill still have a high quality dutch oven pot that can be used on the stovei bought it because of my instant pot pressure cooker that i am very pleased withim glad i trusted the instant pot namebranddoes not disappoint love it"
9278,5,this pot is perfect it was able to make rice and the perfect texture and does all that it statesthis pot is everything and more
3896,1,when i first got this for my daughter we she was so excited she take  photo and turned off the camera then later that day she came to take a video but it turned off we didnt think it was much just that the battery died but now it just wont turn on i do not recommend this camera and the audio was really bad in the videos it sounded so muffled anything we did wouldnt help i dont recommendjust bad
6417,1,we never once got to use this camera because it ate the sd card and the screen states there is no card insertedunfortunately my son broke his arm shortly after we got the camera so it was a few months before he was able to race bmx again by the time we realized the camera was defective it was past the product supportreturn window total waste of money both the camera and the memory cardcamera ate the sd card
490,2,we have tried messing with the setting but all of the pictures continue to turn out extremely overexposed very disappointed in the quality of pictures it takesoverexposed
11224,1,it stopped working after  uses the touchpad isnt responsive it wont turn on or it will turn on but wont allow you to select an option to start it cooking once i was able to get it to work by repeatedly opening and closing it like four or five times in a row but overall it is just a source of frustration disappointing and a waste of money do yourself a favor and spring for an established brandstopped working after  uses
17058,5,i love this product i have used it for all my soups stews whole chickens and much more i believe it is so much better then standing over a hot stove or turning on your oven and making your house hot during the hot summer days i also find that instead of waiting for hours for your food you can have it ready in  hours less then waiting for the regular  hours even on low settings for example i did a  roast on low for  and my roast was perfectly done in  hours i have also made spaghetti with the start to finish of boiling to one pot meal plus the atimantic switch to warm is a great feature for when you are one the go all day and it wont dry anything i have recommended this to all my friends and family and they love theirsbest dutch oven
1228,2,had to buy another sd card its hard to get the quality rightcomplicated
1024,2,i knew it was a cheap digital camera but i expected more it really was no more powerful than my phone camera dissatisfiednot what i expected
7601,2,one of the lights works the other wont stay on i have to press the on button like  times to get it to turn on then it will turn off at random junkycheap and faulty
15862,5,everyone should have a rice cooker and this little one is as good as any other easy to use good instructions and a nice size comes with a measuring cupnice little rice cooker
3192,1,i use a lot of sandbags for weighing down cstands on video shoots the fabric is thin and the stitching on the handles is pretty weak so i cant see these lasting too long the pouches are secured with velcro so you should definitely use a ziploc bag as a liner ill get some use out of these but i wouldnt buy more of them and cant really recommend them just because they will inevitably break its well worth spending more to get some rugged wellmade bags that will lastpretty flimsy not worth the money
8767,1,i bought a polaroid go that doesnt work i take pictures with it and they all come out dark so i put the light on anyway and the flash doesnt seem to work at all i did not make the immediate claim because i thought i would have to see a tutorial and try in different locations but it did not workmy polaroid go never worked
2820,2,only worked for well for  month after that video started to freeze up and would sound funny when a video was taken stopped working after  months of usestopped working after  months of use
8609,2,completely unsatisfied waste of  instant sharing is very misleading in this day of techthere is no wifi so not sure what instant sharing  no audio recordingplayback action camera that doesnt have  most importantly july  just  months after purchase and only being used for  daysthe camera has stopped workingnew batteries new cables nothingoutside of return date and no help from amazonhorriblestopped working gritty image no audio recordingplaybackno wifi instant sharing
11848,4,"first what i liked easy to use easy to clean it has a pot inside you can pull in an out the first time we barely read the manual just immediately opened it washed it and set it cook rice the rice was of the correct consistency and well donewhat the small caveat is and why it didnt get a full rating doing rice daily the way i eat i need to find ways to get away from the stove this achieves it but i started a stopwatch right after i plugged and started it set it to rice and go it takes  minutes to begin a self timer of an additional  minutes to complete just rice if you are looking for something quick this is not it so versatility lost for me therethis product however makes up for its slow times with other dishes that i have yet to try and i time how long they takefor its low price point id say this would be in my top list for rice cookerseasy to use set and forget with a small caveat"
9694,5,for the price youre not gonna get a better one been using for half a year and still works like newbest rice cooker
7602,1,i bought these on  and returning on  because they burned out already they did work great until they didnt im also grateful that they burned out less than  days so i can return themburned out less than  days
6296,2,the camera video is misleading it does not have a remote control or outdoor microphone also does not have a sims card as stated  this camera also only had one battery missleading advertising
4937,2,needed a waterproof camera for my holiday to costa rica and ordered this it arrived and i spent some time setting it up but it wouldnt work very disappointed and the kodak helpline told me to return it very disappointed 
10272,5,i bought this product already knowing that i loved it as a friend of mine already had one its hard to make rice in my larger instant pot so its perfect for small meals for making rice i also often use it to steam vegetables which come out perfectly per the instructions highly recommendi love this little thing
3341,1,this is a piece of junk unfortunately i threw threw the box away so i cant return it locks up every time you take a picture locks up if you try to review your pictures locks up pretty much when you do anythingpiece of junk
4721,1,once we charged the camera we were able to take two photos before it quit working now it just says can not print high temperature i will be returning this camera my daughter was so excited to be taking picturesdidnt last an hour
10398,5,use it weeklygreat purchase
10596,4,for such a small product it worked great and our rice is perfect every single timewow
8415,1,product is great however the shipping takes months they act like it is coming from chinaslowwwww shipping
17153,4,"for me this rice cooker is replacing an aroma pro rice cooker that suddenly died it wasnt old enough die but it perished suddenly when looking for a replacement i was considering an instant pot and i researched and asked around about them in that process i found that instant pot makes a rice cooker and got super excited i didnt really want to pay for an instant pot because i wouldnt use the other functions very much so i decided to try thisawesome decision on my part it cooks my rice jasmine and basmati sooo perfectly i like the pot in this rice cooker way better than the one that was in my aroma the aroma would almost overcook the rice sometimes and even if it was just nicely cooked the rice stuck the instant pot does not stick its a much better coatingmy one and only issue is cleanup the pot is easy  dishwasher and done the cooker itself needs to be tended to a little when it gets hot and boils up initially it does sputter and spew a little i sit it on a kitchen towel and thats not such a big deal but the inset part of the lid causes the starchy goop to pool up so that needs to be wiped out again ugh but not the end of the world and well worth the yummy rice the really annoying thing is the liprim inside the cooker it fills with the starchy water and isnt the easiest thing to clean again to me the cooker is still worth it but i think instant pot could fix that issuei would buy this again in a heartbeat and am enjoying using it and we use it at least  times a week love itmuch better than aroma"
6272,1,looks like a refurbished productmine came with the battery in the camera and it was almost deadbattery dont last long
6241,2,quality of material and workmanship was excellent very heavy material which should last a long time and stand up to just about any weather unfortunately this makes the material very stiff and unwieldy when i put it on my camera it interfered with the autofocus as it would impede the cameras ability to turn the lens it also was nearly impossible to get my hand out to the lens to either zoom andor focus it manually i had to return it as i found it unworkablethe good and the bad bad wins 
3922,1,all the pictures come out so dark i regret buying itbad quality pictures
1344,2,shutter seemed slow zoom feature would not always work somethings were ok but basically disappointedi found my phone takes better pictures
5578,1,this is the biggest piece of crap camera most of the pictures dont show up film comes out white and not able to reuse them i bought a replacement the same thing happened and now its too late to return either i am so disgusted with this item also the button to open the lens broke on one camera do not buy pos
10842,4,its not quite  cups but i already knew the measurements would be off so i ordered  cups hoping for a  cup and thats what i got i subtracked a star because the measurements are offnot  cups
3307,1,i bought this and used it once just to test it out pulled it out of the desk for use this month and it wont turn on set it on the charger and it took  to charge but it still wont charge i didnt expect it to last long but to not be able to use it at all was surprising i wouldnt buy this brand againdoesnt last long
8744,2,camera looks good but unfortunately the interior of the viewfinder is smudged and cannot be cleaned so looking through it you cant see clearlyviewfinder came smudged
5408,1,this camera has focus issues i tried over and over again to get a good sharp focus picture always blurry terrible for close upfocus problems
1888,1,i believe the box was already opened the camera was doa wouldnt even turn on it was missing the batteries that were supposed to be included not the same amount of film as indicated in the advertisement and the camera did not work even with my own batteries put in i went with a different model instax  after i returned this one hoping i get a better experienceopen box and missing items
8799,2,its super cute just that the pictures come out dark not a good cameravery cute but not good at pictures
4239,1,waste of money  cant figure out how to use the camera  battery never recharges and cant find the menu  getting something elsestill cant figure out how to use this camera  it doesnt ever give me a menu
12052,5,i waited a few years before i finally pulled the trigger and bought this rice cooker i thought i didnt need it id been cooking rice and steaming veg for many years just fine thank you and i like brown rice no really its delicious and deserves more respect so i hemmed and hawed because at the end of the day i didnt want to sacrifice any precious counter space for a tool that wouldnt become a major workhorse i finally decided now was the time and man i waited too long this little rice robot is it i use it at least six times a week usually  or  times a day its perfect for all white rice all short and mediumgrain brown rice think brown jasmine jasmine vegetables and dumplings gyozaall of the storebought varieties im branching out now to mixed rice quinoa and the like and we use it exclusively for sushi get the tamanishiki rice its worth it im going to start pushing things with long grain brown rice like basmati but even if my experiments dont work out its fine money well spent and when it ultimately breaks in  years ill just turn around and buy another as an aside apparently you can bake steam a cake in it and i might try that one day and like every other reviewer the little songs for start and finish are a freakin joy buy it nowim glad i finally pulled the trigger
6898,1,this product worked great for the first time it was recording videos in  minute loops after checking the footage to see how the video quality came out and wiping the sd card recording never worked the same again after putting the sd card back in and doing the same process i did before the videos were now only  minute and it was the minute from when i put the sd card in the loop feature no longer works along with the motion just for  minute after putting the sd card back into the slotworked only once
154,1,i dont like it the quality so bad 
1485,1,didnt want it any more so i returned it and only got  instead of the full price do not pay this itemdidnt want it any more so i returned it and 
5584,1,the picture they post does not represent what you are buying completelymisleading
8960,1,the camera  is junkthe camera  is junk
16330,5,so far its been greatworks great
4530,1, weeks and it freezes with  seconds of turning on until it runs out of batteriesalready broken no returns
7237,1, i bought a certified refurbished model and it is still paired to another device you cannot reset the pairingcamera without a micro sd card not  did not come with original accessories or packagingpaired with another device  was not fully inspected
6374,2,bought this as a tester for my fpv freestyle drone all the accessories fit regular mounts and it is easy to use battery lasts great and it is light so it doesnt affect my drones flight at all my only complaint is that with a  sd card in  i only get  minutes of recording before it says the sd card is full i dont know about you but  should be able to hold more than  minutes of hd video i tested with a nikon camera with the same sd card and was able to get well over half an hour on the card with no issues going to play with setting but because of that i am very disappointed in this cameradecent for price but short record time
16828,5,after tossing my economy rice cooker because it not only burnt rice but the consistency of the unburnt rice was bad but not wanting or needing a super expensive unit i gave this one a try it makes perfect rice every time it also has variable options for different rices but i have really only tested the long grain white rice and sticky rice and it has been perfect down to the last piece of rice every time no sticking or dried out or overcooked rice the removable cooking unit makes cleaning is a flash nothing negative to say about this one well worth the extra moneyhad it a while now and were eating more rice
8079,1,this thing is terrible quality everything single picture from my first reel was black every single picture from the second had no focus camera is garbage film is garbage do not waste your moneygarbageget the off brand

977,1,no sd card was included with the camera it stated one is includedsd card
13528,5,i had a big rice cooker that was at least  years old it still worked but im usually making rice for  people i decided that it was time less storage space and a more compact size this little guy is great nicely cooked rice  always easy to use easy to clean easy to store at first i was concerned that it didnt have a keep warm mode but i quickly learned that once the rice was cooked it stayed warm at least as long as i kept the lid closed easy easy easy highly recommendi love this
13162,4,i like mine but it doesnt work as well as some others that ive used price wise is okay overcooks the rice in the bottom and the rubber piece that vents the steam on the inside gets stuck and prevents the steam from releasinggood enough for the price
4332,1,after about a month of light use the seams along the main compartment tore and unraveled junkedit i was contacted by the vendor and offered a refund or replacement i took the replacement because i like the design and size of the bag excellent customer support i updated my review from  star to  stars i have only used the new bag a couple of times ill see how it holds upedit after using the replacement bag for a brief time i have concluded that the quality of the materials and the workmanship is quite low the outside cover material of the second bag has started to fray i am going to try to repair it because i like the design of the bagjunk
12958,5,ive only used this once to make quinoa and i only made half of a portion as per their directions and wasnt sure how it would turn out because the recipe called for double the quinoa and double the water that i used when it was done cooking the quinoa did look like it was slightly overcooked but tasted fine anyway this is a set it and forget it cooker and you just have to wait for the timer to count down listen for the beep and youre done fantastic little machineive only used this once so far but i really like it
16596,5,for the reviews saying they are having a time with the controls gently stub your finger over the button like you are swiping a phone screen you need the littles amount of contact also what have i been doing on earth without this rice  will not be without onegentle touch will for it

16964,4,"i bought this cast iron dutch oven slow cooker to replace my really really old west bend slow cooker i chose this one to try because its teflonfree and seems less likely to crack like ceramic liners are known to do so far these are my pros and cons for this unitprosi will still have a useable dutch oven when the base eventually failsthe dutch oven insert is compatible for use on an induction cooktopit comes with a handy silicone hot pad and handle coversit has open style handles instead of solid making it easier to get a secure grip when lifting the pot out of the baseno need to season or reseason the interior because of the enamel coatingits been rather easy to understand the controls and convert instructions from old recipes im a person who hates complicated technology with functions ill never use so this appliance suits methe depth and width of the pot works great for whole chickens and smallish or boneless turkey breasts the saute function allows you to brown poultry in the pot first cook then make your gravy and end with simmering a bone broth all in the same pot i really like thattheres a keep warm mode that im very happy to have but the pot itself also holds heat well to keep things warm for a while after cookingmy cake pans fit in it to help press in parchment paper for bread proofing or bakingcontrary to another popular review ive been able to adjust the time and temp during cooking by pressing the temptime light once or twice to toggle between the prior set temp  time and turning the knob to adjust whichever setting is blinking or you can just hit cancel and reset everythingconsthis is promoted as being dishwasher safe but then the cleaning instructions recommend hand washing with mild soap to preserve the enamel coating thats sneaky marketing if you ask meenamel coatings will also scratch and chip with metal utensils so tips on the internet say to use wooden or silicone coated utensils to avoid that kind of wear and tear expect to soak rather than abrade cookedon food some may prefer a light interior enamel in spite of them tending to stain instead of the black interior these have it makes it harder to see how much youve browned darker meats without picking them up out of the pot to look at not a problem with browning poultry in my experience and you have to turn meat as it browns anyway so it doesnt bother methe rim of the lid and pot black are not enameled and there are reports of issues with rust there on social media especially if you are determined to clean in a dishwasher thats prevented by putting a little cooking oil on your finger to oil the edges before and after each use and drying thoroughly after cleaning this can be a pro because these are the spots where chipping is likely to occur from lifting the lid on or off or banging a spoon on the edgewhile slow cooker liners are supposed to be heat resistant up to  degrees f you shouldnt use them for the saute function because they are likely to melt and ruin your pot and food use only for slow cooking if you must but be aware that bpa substitutes are not considered safer than bpa why get away from teflon only to expose your food to other chemicalsit takes up a lot of kitchen real estatethink half of your sink base cabinet or as much as a toaster oven that fits a  square pan my breville mini its weight might make it too much for pull out drawers in cabinets toofrom the questions answered sectionq can you leave this while at work in slow cooker modea thanks for your question customer safety and satisfaction is our top priority we dont recommend that you leave the instant precision dutch oven unattended when in use please always be nearby while using this appliance by instant brands support on december   really who hangs around their slowcooker for  hours sounds like a coveringourbutts recommendation but in their defense one has to keep in mind that cooking times in a dutch oven are likely going to be less than in other kinds of slow cookers theres likely going to be a need to make adjustments from the times you are used to counting onthe cord is not detachable from the base i wish i could put it in the pot when im not cooking with itits made in chinaallinall i am enjoying this slowcooker it has versatility that i didnt have with my old west bend model and it seems relatively welldesigned and made time will tell if the base has a decent longevity but electronics are usually the weak spot of any appliance you dont need this if you already have a slowcooker you like and have a dutch oven pot but if you need to get or replace a slowcooker id consider this onemy pros and cons"
3440,2,i was so excited for this camera ive been playing with it for a few days but im so disappointed with the picture quality reminds me of my cheap digital cameras from  the pictures are very blurry and very brightyellow i keep playing with it with hopes that it will get better and it doesnt the concept is great but wasnt worth the purchase in my opinion also did not come with a charging cord definitely disappointed love the idea but terrible picture quality
9879,5,"i replaced a very basic aroma rice cooker with this one when the nonstickiness of the old one no longer functioned i like this one better because easier to read the measurement markings on this one can set to finish rice at a later time using the timer much less steamy rice goop coming out and messing everything up larger capacity though this is not a big consideration  there are only  of us at most easier to clean i dont have to clean the messy glass lid of the other model just wipe the integrated lid of this one and the edges and wash the bowl and empty the condensation collector lid is integrated and latched so its easier to move around as a unit and store in my cupboardit makes rice well  i guess it does take longer than my old one did maybe  minutes vs  for the old one but i just start cooking earlier no biggie as others have said the steamer basket is small and a little disappointing if you truly want to steam a protein and veggies while youre cooking your rice you should buy a bigger rice cooker unless youre only one person who doesnt eat a lotimprovement over base model"
2009,2,pictures did not come out as advertised i had to return it and when i did i included a photo i took with the camerapictures do not come out as advertised

815,1,im having problem with my camera not taking the sims card to be able to download pictures on it what do i dohaving trouble getting the sams card to work on my camera what do i do
1570,2,after fully charging the camera the battery drains quicklywithin about  minutes ive tried with both included batteries and had the same result im upset bc i bought this camera for my sons school trip and my return window has closedcamera not charging properly
17644,5,"im going to join the amen chorus of  reviewers and simply say buy it i rolled the dice and bought a used one sold and backed by amazon the box was a little tattered but the rice maker itself was as good as new and no signs it was ever used were found yaysimply stated this machine works beautifully and makes the best rice ive ever made yes it takes longer to cook rice than some others but thats required to make really really good rice no burning no sticking no issues hey if youre too impatient to wait it has a quick cycle but my recommendation is simply plan ahead and set the delay timer no excuses to have the best rice ever waiting for you when you get home from work what a wonderful appliance kudos to zojirushi for getting it absolutely rightjust buy it"
11053,4,i have been using this unit for  years and ive found it easy to use easy to clean and reliable the only issue i have is that it has a teflon coating which has been flaking off over the years im now looking for a ceramic or stainless steel inner bowl im disappointed that the product description does not specify the type of coating this is typical of all rice cooker product descriptions they seem to give you all kinds of irrelevant information and leave out the only important detail the inner pot materialgreat product but switching to a nonteflon cooker
10112,4,its really easy to use it has the rice ready in  but it does have a leak whenever its cookinggood for on the go
9863,5,thank youthank you
16576,5,"i have both the  cup and  cup model and am happy with botha lot of reviews say the rice boils over and others say it burns the rice on the bottom any browning on the bottom is likely do to one of two issues not to much water or not washing the rice first to remove as much starch as possible any boiling over is likely using too much water in combination with not washing the rice to remove starchif you want to make it work like a toaster as one reviewer said put the rice and water in and its done buy either costly prewashed rice or after putting the rice in the cooker rinse it until it runs clear than add the amount of water necessary for how many cups you are makinguse it according to instructions and remember its very different than cooking rice in a pan on a burnerexcellent good for the price"
2114,1,the camera didnt work even though i bought new  batteries like the instructions saidfaulty
6018,1,after a month stopped working had to send it back the problem was due to recharging problem more over  in israel no one could give me warrantyi do want to thank amazon for giving me an opprtunity for a full refundbad product with charging problems
11136,5,i love mine cooks great rice its small and doesnt take up a lot of cabinet spacecooks faster
17375,5,although the price may scare some away this rice cooker was recommended to me by a friend and it makes the perfect rice every time very easy to use and learn to use while taking up a small footprint in the kitchen if you make rice multiple times a week i would highly recommend this productmakes the perfect rice every time
8298,1,product screen did not work coming out of the boxdo not buy
4799,2,the processes of getting the camera repaired from the manufacture has been so long and annoying its under the one year warranty but i had taken maybe  photos before it just stopped working didnt damage or drop etc just stopped working one day very disappointed would not buy this brand again already shopping for a polaroid to replace the repaired camerabroke after just a few months
4737,1,does not work properly malfunctions turns off when you try to take pictures waste of moneyconstant malfunctions
8801,1,the camera was very easy to use and very compact  the pictures were horrible all my pictures came out blurryhorrible picture quality
16821,2,it looks beautiful tried it with  different rice types and different ratios to come up woth the desired texture it cooks slowly which should be a good thing and the rice upon opening the pot is satisfactory it however doesnt really live up to the expectations cooking more than  cups means that there will be leftover rice the stay warm feature continues slowly cooking the rice makes it mushy and yellowish i was expecting an induction machine but this one is no different than a  rice cooker so im returning it save up for a better one or buy a cheap onegood looking nothing else to report
16881,4,the cord is a little awkward so it cant be flush to wall on counter and it is a little hard to figure out programming at first but once we did its easy to just push a few buttons we wish the done signal were loudergreat rice every time
1519,1,fully charged battery went completely dead overnight yes it was off microphones dont work on it bought a trrs to trs adapter tried two headsets and one microphonei understand it is inexpensive but it should have basic functions charging the other battery to see if it drains onernight big disappointmentinexpensive and not worth it
246,1,camera came to me working fine had it for about a week then the screen went blank at first i thought it was the battery changed it charged it still nothing i dont know why the screen didnt work crazy part about the screen not working was i was still able to take picture without see what i was looking at in the camerano good

4682,2,it takes forever to read new files i always have to amount and mount again until my new files show up for me to transferso frustrating
1125,1,this camera was okay but the customer service was horrible when i received my camera i also received an defective charger i reached out to customer service only for them to initially respond promising to fix the situation only to ghost me and ignore the other messages i sent so i had to purchase an additional charger from another company in order to use the camera because im a vlogger i have an expensive camera but needed a less expensive also on hand for recording the battery doesnt hold charge long maybe an hour or so so beware if you plan on recording for long periods of time this company needs to do better i shouldnt have had to seen more money for something that should have been working when i received it so customers beware pleasecustomer service sucks  the camera battery doesnt hold charge long
6754,1,dont waste your good money doesnt capture photos like the original paper that comes with cameradoesnt work
434,1,the look on my daughters face when she opened her birthday present and found the camera bag was stained and dirty the rear screen was scratched the lenses were covered in fingerprints and she realized she got a used camera and we paid full pricepretty disappointing going to a box store next time figured id be okay buying from canon but apparently theyre another one sending out used gear as newused camera
10617,5,"i went from having no rice cooker to having this rice cooker my rice consumption has gone up like im a singleperson household with a small kitchen limited storage space this makes it mad easy to cook a serving or two of rice on a whim and it takes like  second to clean up once the little pot is cooled off plus its cute to look atits nice that the manual suggests other easy meals i could make with the cooker too i dont know that ill ever bother but its nice to know i have the optioncute and easy to use"
2207,2,unfortunately the lighting in this box is woefully insufficient and imbalance there are lights on the front and left side of the box but not on the right nor the back sides this wouldnt be such a problem if you could purchase additional lights but its surprisingly tricky to find anything that can be easily added which leaves this box pretty useless unless you want to spend hours color correcting the background of your product shotslights not bright enough and uneven
7670,1,got this for our kid for christmas  opened presents yesterday  charged it and it clicks all the time  definitely does not work  wish i could contact the seller  of course i am outside the reruns windowcant make it work
5065,2,the pictures are just ok and the videos are not good the picture is not smoothbad video taking
2823,1,i have no idea how this piece of crap got any good reviews currently it wont turn offbut thats after we attempted to get any of the horrible quality pics off most of them wouldnt transfer or would only partially transfer its literally not worth anything and now i cant return it do not waste your moneyworthless
4071,2,i was looking at these cameras for a long time and excited when i purchased them the initial setup sync the cameras to router was not bad it was difficult getting the batteries in the slide mechanism was hung up on every camera the effort required felt like you were going to break it off by prying it open i setup the cameras in various positionsgarage back door front door but the motion detection was very slow to initiate recording a camera on my garage  ft from a vehicle that pulled in would not initiate recording until they backed upin almost every scenario i would miss the critical view with the camera delaythe only thing i would catch was someone walking away from my front door keep in mind the camera and wifi router are  feet away after playing with them for days i found you could use one cameras motion detection and trigger another camera for video that was helpful but even with a perfect video you couldnt identify a person their face was pix elated this significantly decreased the value of the video system unless you are looking for deer or the ups truckseveral days later the video on one camera turned pink i called netgear and their support was what forced me to return the system they were difficult to deal with and once i finally got them to agree to send me a new camera they asked me for a credit card and told me they would charge me for the camera if it was not returned in  business days ii explained that is not enough time and i dont want to deal with reimbursements if you dont acknowledge the package in time note i buy everything online and have never been asked for a credit card for someone to replace defective equipment i figured speaking to a manager to fix this but they told me it would take days to speak to a manager time passed and i finally get a call back and it was the same situation they refused to send me a working camera without a credit card i did mention that customer support is critical and based on their current approach i was just going to return the cameras sam at netgear said thats fine have a nice day case number  two days later a  camera turned pink and resettingresyncing them did not resolve itissues i foundpoor motion detection increasing the sensitivity made it worse constant videos of nothingpoor video even with hdgigantic delay between motion detection and actual video starting to recordbatteries cost almost  to replace   lithium batteries per camera x  camerasinfrared constantly hung up giving a pink videopoor customer supportcameras killed my wifi  up and down needed to turn off netgear router to connect to work vpncameras killed my wifi gigantic video delay infrared constantly hung up batteries cost 
9770,5,"i had a previous aroma rice cooker for years before it broke as i literally used it every day i read some soso reviews about the brown rice here so i was hesitant but based on my prior experience decided to go with this one especially because it has a few more features than my other one which was pretty basicmy brown rice tasted incredible using this new model i didnt have any issues with fumes or overflowing water etc this model actually made the brown rice way better than my older model and that was already pretty good the one thing i will say is i typically make  cups uncooked and this was a great size for that  i can definitely go up to  cups but i do believe  cups would be pretty full to the rim so you may not want to do that necessarily i think any rice maker you get tends to exaggerate a bitthe  cups fed a family of  which is me my hubby and  teenage sons so not bad not sure ill ever need to make  cups so that doesnt affect my reviewsits greatthe best brown rice"
13427,5,even though it looks simplistic and basic it makes one of the best steamed rice highly recommend itparents love it
8942,1,camera will not turn on it was fully charged and able to be used one day then i took it to a park the next to take some photos and the camera wouldnt turn on i have replaced the battery and all that but still nothing very upset and need a refund or resolutionvery upset

1969,1,very grainy photos i returned horrible qualitydefinitely not 
4221,1,in my opinion this camera is a piece of junk the product gives the illusion that this camera is great for anyonebeginner kids seniors adults maybe id give it to a child but if youre an adult looking for a cheap digital camera id recommend paying more for a better one which im going to do this camera feels and looks like such a light cheap thing in my hands when i snap a photo it takes a blurry poorquality image and also makes loud sounds if you want flash you have to automatically turn it on beforehand my amazing digital camera that ive had for  years recently broke and i just could not deal with this one being its replacement i also bought it on cyber monday being fooled into believing the price was cheaper but come to find out its the exact same ill be returning thiswould not reccomend
14256,5,the family i gave this to really loves it he is a chef and is appreciative of all is features he is utilizing all of its featuresbest rice cooker
8921,1,requires useless and confusing app to establish wifi connection to transfer photos that doesnt seem to work if you want frustration and your camera to not have smart functionality then this is the camera for you was missing usb cable i regret this purchase very disappointeddont waste your money
4187,2,my camera was delivered today but it was clear that someone has already used it the batteries were already in the camera which they were not supposed to be and one of the packs of photo paper was missing from the opened box i tried to set up the camera to start taking pictures and noticed an extra piece within the camera after researching this was the remains of the used photo paper that had been stolen additionally the extra items came in an ikea ziplock baggy which made it seem like this wasnt new i reached out to amazon customer service about the missing photo papers and they reimbursed me for the price of the papers but i would not buy from this seller there are many other options for buying this camera on amazon and i would recommend purchasing from one other than this onebuy the product not from this seller
1895,1,while i was ok with the mini photos we purchased this to be used for my moms  birthday surprise party we had difficulty getting it to start taking pictures and then each roll would only take two to three pictures we had to scrap the idea and use cell phonesso disappointed and frustratedhorrible quality
5796,1,i bought a brand new camera but received a used camera that had issues i returned it right awaywas sent a used camera  it was very clearly written on the box
9301,5,definitely worth purchasing makes rice easily and clean up isnt messy at all easy to use havent had any issues with itperfect rice cooker
17135,5,"i love this and for anyone who loves the color teal it is definitely beautiful now on to the actual product i love this i have officially gotten rid of my slow cooker and though it is made by the instant pot company it is not fast but i have actually moved to using this much more than my ip i love the soups slow cooking a good zuppa tuscana chili or stew is wonderful i alter the dutch oven recipe to work in this slow cooking dutch oven love it it is heavy after all it is cast iron so freaking heavy  however it is cast iron sooooooo"
12515,5,this rice cooker is just what i needed to cook soups etc with my solar battery i have browned onions and meat in it and this cooker did did a very good job i also made a stew type dish in it which turned out well i would recommend being sure all ingredients are close to or at room temps because this cooker only goes up to  watts which makes it a little slow to get up to speed i think this item was a great buy will update if i change my mindso far so good
4711,2,this reader put photos in another format and couldnt retrieve themnot useable
2546,2,we loved this camera for our  year old but it wont hold a charge and only turns on when plugged inwill only turn on when plugged in
7361,1,this thing is not perfected after some time  when you do get it to work the image quality is at best less than poordont waste your money
13654,5,i bought this rice cooker  years ago and have used it  times every week the pans coating just started chipping recently so i contacted zojirushi directly and bought a new pan i would definitely buy this cooker again for its dependability and easy access to the manufacturer for replacement partsdependable cooker
10366,5,i like my riceabsolutely beautiful creation
5032,1,garbage how can something new not work out of the box never will buy this brand again ruined my wifes bday it was a gift for her now i have to wait  daysdoesnt work
2589,1,i purchased this instax camera for our wedding reception for guests to take a picture in front of a beautiful backdrop and in the whirl of wedding planning we didnt realize that the camera was broken internally until during the reception spending over  on the camera i didnt even think about the possibility of it not working so i was surprised when a little cousin ran over and said the camera was broken im incredibly disappointed not to have the memories of our loved ones because of a faulty productpurchased for wedding guest book and was internally broken
6634,2,i wanted this camera so badly purchased this model because it could connect to my phone such a dissapointment after weeks of trying i got it to connect and it loaded pics from my phone ie backwards not a big fan at allso very dissapointed
6431,2,even when the cameras settings show the resolution as  it only records at  i realized this after trying to edit some of the videos i got sent a replacement camera but it had the same problemmax resolution is  not 
3344,1,if this camera is for children students and children it had the worst instuctions to follow i purchased a  gb sd which i inserted and it would only take  picture it was just terriblehaving more instructions for the camera or a online video
9535,5,"cheap reliable easy ive been using it for a year now and i love it sure it bubbles on the lid depending on the amount of cups and water used but you can easily wash it takes about  minutes to cook oh yah i tend to plug the cord after its done cooking because the rice at the bottom can turn into a yelloworange color if its sitting in keep warm for too longfast my goto"
3300,2,my name is bryson and i do not recommend this camera the picture quality is not very good and when you make videos there is no sound when you play your video you might be wondering why my mom is not writing the review well she bought this camera for me so that is why i am writing this review yes this is my moms amazon account that i am reviewing on dont think that this review is not helpful because i will tell you about the camera now the durability is not good as well as the picture quality the videos you make dont have sound so the camera does not record with sound i dont recommend this cameranot recommended
16853,5,i have used many rice cookers some that were much more expensive than this one but this one is by far my favorite it is so easy to use and the rice always comes out perfect i highly recommend this one over any other rice cooker especially for the priceeasy to use
1985,2,i had a great time with this for about six months i took it out about four times just out and about to take photoshowever it just stopped working one day the gears that roll the photo out no longer work which is pretty disappointing considering how little i used it tried cleaning it and everything even when the product was working the exposure was either way to high or to low to get a decent shota little disappointing
3456,2,when loading the film in the back cover doesnt want to stay on plastic tabs that hold it down and in place bendbreak easilyback cover doesnt stay in place
14715,5,exactly what i needed affordable and cooks perfect ever time has every function you need without adding complicated additional functions has an hour meter to show how long the rice has sitting after cooked seals well so i cook dinner and the rice is fine to eat with next days lunch or leftovers to finish up the rice quick clean and ready for dinner againawesome rice cooker
6706,2,im returning this i have a canon  mk iii and putting it in the backpack takes almost all the space for the gear compartment it cannot hold as many things as they show its beautiful but useless if i cant fit my equipment herei need to take my drone camera and at least my  lens and it will barely fit im really disappointed i thought i was going to get everything i neededim going to end up buying a bigger and cheaper backpacknot for pro photographers
11384,5,i love it ive never made sticky rice before so this was a perfect starter cooker  recommend super cute too its really easy to clean and makes a decent amount of riceperfect  cute
4822,1,i wish i would have read more of the reviews camera stopped functioning after the first packet of film was replaced maybe  months of occasional use apparently this is a problem with this model past the return amazon window now i get to try to return it to manufacturerstopped working after short time
10478,5,wasnt too sure about this little cooker but ive been pleasantly surprised its the perfect size for one or two people ive tried some of the recipes in the book and my favorite has been the quinoa taco bowl have also made macaroni and cheeseperfect for one or two people
17277,4,i bought a rice cooker since we eat a lot of rice my issue is that i make brown rice and for some reason i mess it up just as much as i can make it right this is the fool proof way to do it and i bought this one specifically because it has a brown rice option its small and doesnt take much space but it takes forever to make rice so definitely prepare for that and if you can make rice on the stove topits much quicker my brown rice calls for simmering for  minutes after you bring it to a boil this rice cooker probably takes twice as long to make rice but it comes out perfectly everytime so i honestly done waste much rice anymore and i make it and leave it in the fridge until ready to useim torn on this
2527,1,i got this to have a hard copy of pics after a pet died and photos disappeared picture is garbage  of the timepet literally sitting still and just before hitting the button the screen blurs and refuses to focus every time ive taken  good pic out more than  attempts this is not a good value for the money it feels flimsy and reminds me of the something id use as a child i wouldnt care about that if it took good pics but it doesnt soooooalso i started out giving this  stars but writing it all out made me angry enough to drop anothermy phone is better
3718,1,lights started out great after  months of occasional use one of the lights stopped working today almost  months later the other light stopped workingshort term life both lights now have stopped working would not buy again
14186,5,i decided to buy it because of the cute and fresh green fashion design looking attracted my eyes this rice cooker is perfect for small family size use my kitchen is small it saves more space to put than my instant pot it cooks congee better taste than instant pot does also it is really easy to clean five star buy will recommend to my friends and familyperfect for small family use 
2611,1,didnt come with any film or batteries or case camera didnt even worknot worth it
12305,5,im a licensed massage therapist and was using a garage sale mini rice cooker to warm my hot stones when it died i replace it with this same brand much newer version  it works great and still very reasonable costit probably cooks rice great too
9362,5,"works well cooks rice nicely cleaning was a breezethe only negatives i noticed is that the lid is a bit flimsy and seems cheaply madebut otherwise it made rice for the family in  minutes everything was as it should be havent used it to steam vegetables as it isnt the primary reason we ordered it but we might at some point in the futureworks great lid feels a little cheap"
3983,1,we bought this for our wedding and it broke halfway through guests using it wish i could still return it or get a refund so frustratingbroke after first use 
13880,4,"made some brown rice for my first test and it came out well clean up was easy disassembling the top was quick and reassemble afterwards was no problem white rice came out better than i could have ever made it before using a pot and lida few gripes were the ac power cord is positioned oddly on the right side of the unit its a bit of an eyesore if left on the counteramazon also sent me an opened unit that had fingerprints all over the outside and a lpn barcode indicating that it was inspected at some point was contemplating returning it for that but seems to work wellworks well"
13657,4,"whatever chemicals that is used to clean my water makes it bubble up like it has soap in it when on a low simmer resulting in cooking rice being a complete mess unless i stand guard over the pot and lift it every couple of minutes or so this pot itself doesnt solve that issue but the blowhole on top allows the bubbles to pop with only a minor splash of water and anything that does manage to escape around the lid goes back into the pot rather than over the edge and onto the counter i do still however sit the pot level in the sink or on a towel cause the water from the bubbles popping tends to build up over the  minutes needed to cook the ricethe only reason i give this a  out of  stars is because of the confusion caused by the manual saying the one cup fill line is equal to one cup of rice which is talking about the included cup that is  ounces im not sure why they needed to have a cup that is only  ounces instead of  but here we are in confusion town unless you read the amazon page before you bought it and when cooking rice having  ounces less water can easily result in it being undercooked imagine if you cooked three cupsthis rice cooker is pretty amazing for what it costs"
4485,2,decent product but could be cheaperokay for a wet cleaner package
6968,1,fujifilm instax wide  is a lot more durable had that for  years now and never had any problems bought the fujifilm instax wide  to get a new camera as i lost the top slot of the  and the battery door so it was getting worn outive only had the fujifilm instax  for  months now and it overexposes my photos leaving circles of light on photos and now the lens will not extend i have looked up how to fix this issue but it looks like there is no repairing iti would recommend not purchasing this camera as it is more trouble than its worth and instead purchasing the older modelbut it looks like there is no repairing it
13777,5,so far so good you always get perfect rice just because careful not to scratch itgood product
13146,4,i love how large this rice cooker is and how fast and perfect the rice is cooked but i noticed it does heat the rice a bit too much when it sits overnight which i i didnt have any issues with using my other rice cookers in the past although i did pay more for the older ones they did last a pretty long time i was able to leave the rice in the pot over night and it did not burn or crust on the bottom if left overnight like this one does this cooker seems to be a higher temperature than other ones and was very hot to the touch even the next day when i removed the left over rice so the only reason i gave it  stars is the fact that the bottom of the rice was over cookedlarge capacity but dont leave rice in overnight

2778,2,got all the cousins together for spring break and brought out this silly little kids digital camera youd think theyd be too cool for it turns out everyone even the  and  year olds loves an instant print chuck e cheese style photowe were dying laughing as they began exploring the many filters and funny things you could do with the pictures dog ears etc there were actually quite a few really fun things it also has basic video gameswe used one whole roll of the thermal imaging tape basically thermal register tape that night but still had two more extra rolls included for the next day tons of laughs that nightplugged in the camera to charge overnight morning came and it appeared that the camera had charged up but we absolutely could not get it to turn on for anything we tried unplugging it replugging recharging etc nothing worked the camera never came on again and we basically had to trash itit was a huge bummer because wed had so much fun playing around with it and were expecting lots more laughs out of it that dayso the camera is great it takes quite nice little sketchy black and white instant photos it has a lot of fun extras but it died for no reason and i cant recommend it because of that bummedthis camera was ton o fun  until it wasnt

5073,1,this camera is horrible if trying to vlog im returning not for me at allhorrible
17448,5,fantastic appliance i have mostly used it for two things brown rices like lundberg wild blend and black japonica and wild rice and also steelcut oatmeal for the brown rices i found that precisely using the zojirushi measuring cup and brown rice water lines in the pot yielded excellent results the gaba brown rice setting makes a particularly tasty result possibly with a health benefit the timer function on the cooker is super simple to use and for the long gaba brown rice  cooking time i just set it up in the morning and enter the time i want the rice to have completed cooking results for cooking steelcut oatmeal are also outstanding significantly better than anything else ive tried and veryvery simple in my opinion if you like this or products like bobs red mill whole grain cereals the rice cooker purchase could be justified just for this to produce just enough cereal for two people i use  zojirushi measuring cup of cereal i really like mccanns steel cut irish oatmeal three of those measuring cups of water and about  tsp kosher salt do this in the evening before bed set the rice cooker to the porridge setting and set the time for when you want it ready in the morning literally takes about  to do in the evening as mentioned above the resulting oatmeal is fantastic with a really excellent and pleasing texture the watercereal proportions i suggest make a rather thick product that i then add some milk to you might want to experiment with proportions to get the result that pleases you finally everything cleans up easy fast and with no fuss with rice or porridge absolutely no crustburningsticking as was the norm in my previous rice cooker im very happy with the purchase of this product and would do so again it is a bit pricey but as the old saying goes you only regret buying good tool oncefantastic for brown rices and steel cut oatmeal
13938,4,came with broken lid made sure it worked right away like the settings and i like you can set it when you want it to startfancy
3160,1,turned it on christmas morning and it froze on the menu cant turn it off none of the buttons workdidnt work
14399,4,"good basic rice cooker quick mode is  minutes after my cuckoo broke i needed another rice cooker and this was the best one in what i would consider a reasonable price range i do miss the  minute quick mode on my old cooker but for  dollars more than this modeltip in quick mode add a little more water than you think you needgreat basic rice cooker"
3607,2,purchased this for summer photos and videos in the mountains rivers and lakes near my home product is excellent but they gift you a year of free gopro plus subscription which i canceled a month after buying my camera because i wasnt using it then a year later i get a notice that ive been charged for the next year and when i reach out to them the same day they refuse to cancelgreat product terrible customer service
9807,4,my wife purchased this rice cooker to replace our basic aroma cooker owned for over  years the basic cooker was a family work horse and only needed replacement due to a damaged inner pot for this purchase we decided to upgrade to the professional model this new unit cooks rice well but the plastic spoons and steamer tray are flimsy compared to the old model it also lacks the outer spoon holder hence the  out of  starsgood rice cooker but plastics are flimsy and there is no outer spoon holder
10948,4,"this is deceptively small  cups of cooked rice maybe thimble sized cups we had a previous black and decker rice cooker that we used regularly for  years finally gave out this is a similar design but if i recall correctly they advertised it would hold  cups of uncooked rice big difference apparently that is a  cupper size now  cups of cooked rice would not fit in  regular sized serving spoons if that is truewe had to return it as soon as i opened it up and saw it was about  or  inches deep and about  or so inches wide in the rice pan did not even take it out of the box im sure this would be fine for a college kid cooking for one not for  i love the simple design but it was not for  cups of cooked rice barely maybe if fluffed up after cooking"
7420,2,this instax square  was provided to me at no cost for a fair unbiased review of the producti have an instax printer  so i know a little about the instax cameras but i wanted a selfcontained unit to have with me when camping that i can hand around to my camping friendsthe instax square takes square instax film that loads in the back of the camera you turn the camera on by twisting the lens in the front halfway the lens protrudes out and an orange light comes on to let you know everything is good to do you can also set it to selfie mode by twisting the lens completely twisting it past the on area and there is a little silver panel on the front so you can kinda see yourself to frame everything upthe film i got this this camera for review purposes was already installed in the camera there was a note on the camera telling me that the film had already been installed all i had to do was put batteries in the camera and to twist the lens to turn it on and id be good to goi took the camera with me on a weekend getaway and was planning on taking photos of the area we were visiting but when i started taking test shots in our hotel room the images were not developing correctlyim unsure if this is a bad batch of instax film or if there are light leaks somewhere in the camera but ive included photos of the prints that were coming out of this camera the last shot i took of my hotel room started to come out correctly i have a few shots left in the camera but after seeing the results i was getting i put the camera away and didnt use it for the remainder of my tripsince only one box of film was included with this camera i couldnt install a new pack to try out i have yet to purchase another pack of film so once i do i can update my reviewbut currently i cant leave a good review for this based on the results i was getting from the pack of film included with the camerai have faith that the instax square is a good camera but i cant prove that based on my initial results from trying to use iti dont believe this is an error on my part  the film was already installed prior to me receiving the camera i have not touched anything that deals with the pack film or opening the rear of the camerafor that reason im leaving a twostar reviewthe packin film wasnt working with this camera for review
5036,1,got this for my daughters birthday it did not come with the string to hang up the photos the stickers or the color lensesdidnt receive all items
13761,5,"i am a pretty strong home cook but i am absolutely garbage at cooking rice on the stove no matter how many techniques i try it turns out soggy hard mushy burnt or some combination of the abovei ordered this little rice cooker and gave it a trial run last night triple rinsed the rice in a bowl until the water was clear poured the rice in the pot and added water up to the first knuckle of my index finger and turned the switch on there are no time or temperature settings literally just on or off minutes later the switch went off and i peered in to see the most beautiful rice staring back at me the instructions said to leave the lid on for  minutes to allow steam to create even fluffier rice so i did that and sure enough it was perfecti dont know if some other models have a warming switch or a steaming basket the instructions referenced those but my model didnt have it but i dont mind i can handle everything else in the kitchen and now i can finally handle rice toonearly shed a tear looking at the rice that came out of this"
11243,4,this little rice cooker is my first rice cooker and is only used to make rice the coating on the inside pan is sensitive so i recommend washing it immediately drying and putting it away to prevent any scratches from other dishesoverall good
5496,1,so it is an old design but i expected better my iphone takes better photos and the geotagging is almost worthless should have taken my dslr on the tripold design and iphone app very buggy
17423,5,my last zojirushi was a fuzzy logic cooker from  it traveled with me cross country via  different moves it worked up until a couple of months agoso i had to find a new rice cooker ive always had a zojirushi and wanted to find another one but i wanted the option to open the cooker mid cycle to add ingredients to my rice this model gives me that freedom which i love i find it easy to clean and i love how it keeps rice warm for an extended period of time though i usually will refrigeratefreeze leftover rice to make fried rice later on  fresh tastes to much better im already used to the hour long cool cycle from my old cooker so just be aware you need to plan your meal time based on your rice but i usually try to rinse and have my rice ready to go by the afternoon in the cooker so i can just hit the button and go its a great machine i love it and i hope it last me another  yearsupgraded my old zojirushi
3912,1,play video saw mostly good reviews so i decided to order i did not realize that this product is not sold by fujifilm if you search sold by on the page you will see it in small text i used the camera  times over the course of  months and when i tried to use on christmas morning i got the red flashing lights i tried replacing the batteries and two packs of film expensive but i still got the red lights ive never dropped or mishandled this camera when i called fujifilm they said i have to contact the seller when i contacted the seller here they said since it was past the amazon return date they cant do anything dont risk it and just purchase directly from fujifilm extremely disappointed and unsatisfied with customer service hopefully this review doesnt get hidden do not buystopped working after  months do not buy
3812,1,this sucked looked as if i was taking photos on a camera from  blurry grainy and hard to navigate the batteries never stayed charged and i had to keep the cord plugged in and connected to a power bank to even get able to use it i thought it wouldnt be that bad or would at least get the job done for my vacation and it was money wasted the price isnt worth it spend the extra money on a good cameradont do it
1461,1,should have had rechargeable battery batteries die too fast and pictures start getting blurrynot worth the money
362,2,like its fine ig but hard to use sometimes and it gives temu vibestbh it sucks but it takes cute pix ig
17611,4,"overall happy with this product very easy to use convenient makes consistently good ricegreat for small family like oursi have been using many different rice cooker over many decades from different brand difference type and sizes compared to last rice cooker i had this one is better in function but decrease in quality on parts mainly inner pot or could be called pan they are half the thickness and weight of past cookers this non stick coated pot makes big difference in the taste of rice it is step backward for the cooker in the name of cost savings it also scratches too easy despite my effort during cleaning very disappointed in this part but i guess it is new norm since other manufacture seems to followfantastic product with only one importance issue"
9576,5,it is so easy to clean the pot just pops out and it works great easy to clean
12263,5,i bought this used in likenew condition and the box was the only thing that even hinted that this wasnt brand spanking new this saved me a considerable amount of money over brand new ive since put many miles on it as it gets used several times a week and its still like new it cooks perfect rice every single time this is a con of sorts because many places we go to eat serve inferior rice and that takes away from the dining experience its so simple to use a child could do it all the settings work fantastic brown and wild rice cook amazingly using the brown rice setting even the quick setting for white rice is really good although it rarely gets used in our home porridge is a food id never had until this device but its a great money saver and babies love it the porridge setting can be used to make steel cut oatmeal which is amazing the steamer function is really handy for small meals but the basket has very limited capacity ive even baked a cake using that setting it came out really good but the bottom had just the faintest hint of burnt for some reason it looked perfect though this seems more suited to those without an actual oven or cake pans although it probably saves a bunch of electricity the recipe size was weird and required me to make some adjustments in quantity when preparing the boxed cake mix so maybe i messed up somewhere and burnt taste was a result i could go on about other recipes but just know that this device makes it difficult to mess up cleanup is easy with a nonstick pot and spatula the lid cleans easily too i love the retractable cord the timer function is great to get breakfast ready the night before or have hot rice ready when you get home from work this appliance will keep rice warm for ridiculous amounts of time just add a bit of water every  or  hours as needed the design of the unit is smart and elegant the little songs it plays are cute but you can turn them off if youre not into that sort of thing if you dont already know zojirushi is the standard by which all other rice cookers are measured and this is a midhigh range model in their lineup the price is justified in my opinion and if i somehow lost mine today i would go buy another tomorrow although id go a size up from the  cup due to increased rice consumption as well as a growing familywhats a zojirushi its the key to the rice youve always dreamed of making
390,2,i would rather use my phone camera the quality isnt really good to me the quality is okay loaded on the computer im just not a fan of it but its a god first camera for  camera

14945,4,i was looking for a small rice cooker since my husband and i are seniors and trying to go less carbs i gave away my ten cup one as we are downsizing toothis does the job the numbers on the inside are easy to use and it comes with a measuring cup i also like that it is not coated with non stick coating which eventually comes offjust right for two
10599,4,this rice cooker makes great rice with simple and easy instructionsgreat rice cooker smaller than expected

7175,1,this product is of good quality but for me it just does not seem any more effective than wrapping the regular strap around my wrist as im concerned about security but there are times that i want to carry my camera strap over my shoulder for a short time i dont blame the seller i simply didnt think it through ill keep it howeverimpractical

17131,5,"with all thats going on weve been cooking at home a lot more in the past we used the instant rice pouches after watching a few online recipe videos it became clear we needed a rice cookerthis one has been fantastic weve used it probably  times and rice has been great every time we typically make  servings so the smaller size is exactly what we need this unit may be too small for a larger family but i would think you could get at least  servings of rice out of this without too much troublenever having owned a rice cooker before i didnt realize how inexpensive rice is when you dont buy in the pouch instead of  or  for a singleuse pouch its now  for a bag that will last  meals and the rice tastes betterusage couldnt be easier follow the recommended waterrice ratio provided with the cooker hit the button an just wait the only downside is that there isnt a timer from the beginning of the cycle though a countdown time kicks in at some point through the process what i have done is time how long it takes to make  portion and  portion of rice so i can now plan the rest of the meal accordingly it takes about  minutes to make really tasty rice and with the warming function you dont need to be all that precise in timing out your meals the rice can sit in the cooker for a while without any negative effectlastly clean up is easy with the nonstick interior bowl ive been handwashing the bowl to avoid potential damage to the nonstick surface in the dishwasher but cleaning that takes all of  seconds a serving spoon that works well with rice steaming basket havent used it and measuring cup also come with the cooker the measuring cup uses the term cup but it isnt a true  cup its more of a generic unit for measuring rice and water in the correct ratio so dont lose the included cupbest covid purchase for the kitchen"

14050,5,holy schnikes this thing is sick the rice that comes out of it is just the best i dont have to think about water temperature and even fudging the water level a bit isnt that big an issue plus it automatically goes into the keep warm function which lasts for like  and yes the day old rice that was just kept warm is still just as good makes it super easy to just make some before i go to sleep so its ready to go for work it also plays cute little tunes when it starts so thats funlegit dope
13209,2,i liked the rice cooker and works ok but it stated it can stay warm but when i left it plugged at warm and went to work and came back the rice seemed dry i even tested it twice and still rice seemed fine until i came home and it was dryer than before i cant recommend it if it has issuesthe warm button
15464,5,luv it fast shippingeasy to clean
4402,2,i really wanted to love this frame however the reason i purchased this frame was so that i could link it to my photo albums on shutterfly unfortunately this is extremely difficult to do following the instructions for connecting an external album resulted in either an error message on the shutterfly page or the spinning wheel of death on the pixstar page for hours and hours until it finally timed out after several days of continuously trying to connect a list of my shutterfly albums finally appeared and i was able to link the frame to an album although pixstar says that any additional pictures added to external albums are automatically synched  times a day this is not true  the frame never synchs with my shutterfly album unless i manually synch it on the pixstar website the next problem occurred only a few weeks later when i tried to link another shutterfly album to the frame  this time pixstar seemed to connect to shutterfly but where the list of albums should be its blank and there are no albums to choose this is so frustrating when i have contacted pixstar customer service they always blame the problem on the shutterfly servers frankly i dont care whose fault it is i just want it to be fixed bottom line until pixstar corrects its connectivity issues with shutterfly do not buy this framepoor connectivity to shutterfly

5400,1,this camera is ok when you have lots of light once you are indoors and the subject is more than  away image quality is poor there is no image stabilization when you zoom to  x images are blurry even when resting your arms on a solid object to minimize motion i get much better images from camera on phone they are brighter more crisp even zoom from a fixed lens is betterpoor indoor quality images
7833,1,this little printer is a brilliant idea and i really wanted to love it i bought it for journaling it is easy to set up and use the printer itself seems well made however im disappointed in the photos it prints while the photos are crisp in detail the colors are dull and washed out and skin tones are off it definitely doesnt match the colors in the original photo i have noticed that some pictures do print better than others but even the better ones still dont match the vibrant colors of the original photos i have played with the various color filters in the printer app but they dont seem to make much of a difference im probably not going to return it but knowing what i know now about the print quality i dont know that i would buy it again i definitely wouldnt recommend it unless youre using it for something where picture color quality doesnt matterupdate ive been using this printer for a week or so now and i have to say it is junk i know thats pretty harsh the pictures quality is awful the colors arent even close to the original picture and it doesnt hold a charge i used it plugged in i guess it depends on what you are going to use the pictures for but i want high quality pictures in my journal i lowered my review from  stars to  start as i said in my original review it is a brilliant idea but it seems that the technology isnt yet there to print high quality picturesdont buy unless picture quality doesnt matter
12033,5,"this rice cookerwarmer has been sent down to me from my moms we used it as a family feeding  every single day for  years the preset cooking timers is very convenient as long as we put in the right amount of water for cooking we received good results for our rice normally we cook jasmine rice and i cooked brown rice a few times we love the quality of the cooked rice the main thing that i like about this rice cooker is the reliability one minor thing that i do not like is the quality of the holder for the rice spoon it kept popping off so eventually we ended up removing the rice spoon holderoverall i would mainly recommend this to those who want more out of a rice cooker this one is more versatile than a traditional rice cooker i cant say the quality of steaming other foods with this rice cooker but since the quality of this rice cooker suites my needs i would expect a side of steamed veggies or baking a cake with this rice cooker would also turn out nice we are about to hit  years of usage with this rice cooker and it seems like its going to continue to go strong  years going strong"

4116,1,i had this camera for  year and  months it worked fine for about  months or so then i started having problems with it the batteries needed replacement much sooner than expected typically a month or two before it would need new batteries it seemed to be working just fine still though and the monthly replacement didnt bother me too much i recently noticed it had died and went to replace the batteries as normal this is  months after the  year warranty ran out i replaced the batteries and the camera wont even turn on it blinks an orange light which means the batteries are low i bought a battery charge tester just to see if the batteries were the problem or the camera i tried  different sets of batteries in the charge tester in the camera and in other cameras the only place the batteries dont work is in the arlo camera ive used the same brand of batteries since i got the camera so the only other factor could possibly be the camera so i figure its some issue with the hardware and contact netgear support i got through the entire ridiculous process to troubleshoot the issue even though ive already tested it the same way before numerous times because in reality i just want my camera to work it gets to the point that the support agent wants to send me their own batteries to test the camera with and if it still doesnt work then theyll send a replacement this is a security camera on my property and i dont want to wait  business days to receive batteries in the mail that i know will not make a difference and then another  business days to get a replacement camera i told them it would take too long and that it puts my security at risk because thats what im using their camera for he tells me that the camera is already out of warranty so it would be a onetime replacement anyway so if i dont use their batteries then i wont get a replacement camera i told him im never buying a netgear camera again because i want a camera that will last more than a year just kind of funny how shortly after the warranty period the camera stops working entirely i definitely recommend buying any other camera than this onei definitely recommend buying any other camera than this one

2044,1,i bought a new one and when it first died i put it charge just to find that the charging port didnt work this was after a month of buying it and only using it a few timescame in broken
12199,5,i got this when it was on sale for just under  and some gift cards i had brought it down to about  at that price i love this thing i go out of my way to get khoshihikari homare rice and it makes just about the best rice ive ever had with the push of a button sorry to my japanese grandmagreat when on sale
3462,2,camera produces images of very low qualitycamera blows
8067,1,only was able to get one good picture the next two pictures came out like this waste of film be careful when buying this productdefective
8420,2,when i received this item it had already been opened and there had been two picture cards already used very disappointed that it wasnt an unopened itemreceived a used item and things were missing
10111,5,"seriously wish i had bought one of these eons ago ive never been able to master cooking any kind of rice but minute rice on the stove top i finally learned to make it by baking in the oven but i dont always want to heat up the house just for rice so i took a chance in this inexpensive model amazedhow does it know how much rice is in there and exactly how long to cook it just dump close  turn it on  perfect rice all the way through so glad i got thiswhy why did i got get this decades ago"
10468,5,this little rice cooker was just the right size for me as i am only feeding  people with it it is so easy to use and clean i love itperfect rice cooker for 
4889,2,after jumping in the water noticed the screen was filling with water after surfacing investigated further to see the batterymemory card door was not clicked in place unclear when this came loose since it was checked on shore and was clearly securecamera is completely ruined memory card useless very disappointedeasily becomes not waterproof
3968,1,this product was very disappointing i bought it for my daughter and it was not at all worth the  i paid for it the pictures are not very good quality and printing them sometimes doesnt show my daughter was sad when she wanted to return it and couldnt because the return date expired on uslackluster camera
5914,1,very weak construction and damages easily this lasted only  months a door issue developed where had to hold it down when printing and then later the screen cracked making it garbage as other reviews warned the pictures need absolute light and has to be held very still to come out at all i wish they had spent a few dollars more on plastic shell making it a durable productweak construction so damages easily
13853,4,"let me preface this by saying im asian and have used a big number of rice cookers everyday for the last  yearsthis rice cooker makes great rice and keeps it warm very well without drying it out the fuzzy logic does its magic and rice just comes out perfect every tkme controls are easy to use and is very logical you dont even need to consult the manual using it the first timethe quality of this machine is very good it has a very thick pot probably to hold heat better and better cook the rice the steam vents and inner lid are all removable so it is very easy to clean the insideshere are some of the quirks the timer counts down in increments of  first time was weird and i kept thing it wasnt on until the numbers changed after  minutes not s big deal once youre used to itthe buttons are touch buttons i prefer having physical buttons with some tactile feedback the touch buttons on this respond with a beep not the worst thing but its definitely not my preferencetheres no clip to hang the rice spatula when you eat a lot of rice this is a must these come standard on every other rice cooker not sure why they left this outthe power cord is the typical computer power cord like used on older desktops and feels cheap and super clunky my previous ones either had a retractable reel on the bottom or one a magnetic disconnect or a lighter  prong cord this feels very cheap compared to the rest of the machinegreat rice cooker some quirks"
109,1,i have bought multiples of this camera for my employees to document things around the workplace there is absolutely no way the picture quality is what is advertised i can take a picture of a sheet of paper  feet away and it is so blurry none of the words can be made  in what world
4990,1,i bought this a bit ago and have been fixing it change after chance this thing will randomly stop working constantly overall this purchase was a waste of money and your better off taking pics on your phone and buying that printer that turns it into a polaroid instead do not recommendbarely works
11880,2,it looks like a great item but i didnt receive a users manual i looked at the online manual but it doesnt seem like it tells you how to use and cook the items i dont see a water to rice ratio i would love it if i had a users manual im going to have to look on youtube or the internet and see if i can find guidance ive never owned one and really have no idea how to use it it has many more functions on it that i ever knew existed it seems like it is much more than a rice cooker im pretty disappointedrice cooker
1173,1,the picture quality is horrible and the external mic jack did not work wouldnt recommend this product to anyonesuch a piece of crap
8859,2,pictures arent clear regardless of how close up they are taken also wanted this to take pictures at my sons games ive tried all settings and none seem to capture clear in motion pictures i should have opted for another brand and paid a little more my phone takes more clear pics so im disappointed in this purchase and i hate thatpictures arent always clear even in ideal situations
11256,1,broke the first time i used it just stopped workingdont buy it
14134,2,this unit cooks well but you cant see the display lights as all the letters are super tiny and you have to turn off your kitchen lights in order to see which option is chosen ie brown rice white ricecooks well but cant see display
259,1,i loved this camera until i pulled it out one day to use it and the shutter button was stuck this very unfortunately affects the ability to focus on a subject i went from using this camera regularly to never using it ive had it for just over a year and bought it used on amazon lesson learnedshutter button sticks
3016,1,purchased and it was never mentioned that the camera would be refurbished not as advertised would of never purchased at that price box and the obvious condition of the camera itself says refurbishedyet amazon fulfilment sticker says newarrived refurbished
9854,5,i purchased this product because i needed a second rice cooker for a party i think it does a great job with a variety of foods the oatmeal is wonderful hard boiled eggs are perfect and if you have ever made risotto the hard way you will really appreciate how easy it is in this cooker not to mention delicious oh and it does a great job on rice i like this so much that i bought the larger one for bigger groupsa great addition to your kitchen
3481,2,pictures arent great and picture paper is expensivejust ok
9057,2,at over  per picture it is more expensive than it should be not the films fault but it also arrived very late amazon the shipper and the seller could have done much better the film comes in a box so it would make sense to ship it in a cardboard box like almost everything else i got from them nope it was in a bag the box of film itself was damaged but my wife was so excited to use here new camera we didnt not return it my fault i guessmore expensive than it should be
11205,4,my wife and i dont eat rice very much but when we do we have cooked rice in a regular pot with a lid we like rice so not sure why we we dont eat more of it i bought this rice cooker to give it a try it arrived at  i unboxed it a quick wash and put in one cup of rice and one cup of water i had watched youtube videos so i pushed the start button i realized i had some frozen vegetables in the freezer got these out quickly and put them in the top steamer area my wife was not too pleased having another appliance on the counter  but its fairly small the rice cooked a little too long as there was burned rice in the bottom of the pan not much as  was fine it tasted fine and the vegetables were great i was worried about cleanup but to my surprise the dark brown bakedon rice came right off the bottom of the pan based first experience i think ill keep it and ill be trying oat meal this morningmy first rice cooker  and im 
11219,5,"this little rice cooker is great its both cute and functionali recently started watching what i eat and paying more attention to my food and decided i should get a rice cooker to help introduced more grains into my diet i bought a cheap one before i got this one and while i still use it it was still bigger than i needed and would burn the bottom of the rice too it also boiled over often and just annoyed meso i started looking into a higher end rice cooker and found they get quite expensive especially if you want a smart or fuzzy logic version of which is really the main feature of higher end rice cookers fuzzy logic is just a name for a rice cooker that uses a small computer to help decide whether or not it needs more heat more time and even adjusts to how much moisture more so on the expensive versions conveniently this one also has that ability to adjust its parameters for better ricethen i found this little guy and its perfect small enough i can cook my own portion of rice and still big enough i can make enough for  people all while not boiling over all the time especially with brown rice i just made wild rice in it too and it came out perfect my rice always comes out perfect nowits also very simple to use options from white and brown rice quinoa and steel cut oats ive tried them all and have good results each time for wild rice i just used brown rice you can also adjust the cook time for each individual setting too i appreciate how fast it cooks too if your in a rush for brown rice you can use the white rice setting and still get good results more importantly i have yet to ever have burned rice it has only lightly toasted to bottom once but thats because i left it on warm for a while and is more my fault than itsit is also very easy to clean the non stick helps a lot and being ceramic i dont worry too much everything that news cleaning is easy to take apart and put back together again as welloverall i am very happy so far i have some more experimenting to do yet so ill update latergreat little rice cooker"
11721,5,quality product i am very happy to use pressure cooker every daycomfee pressure cooker  quart with  presets
12187,5,excellent  this is by far the best rice cooker the best 
7223,1,its for point and shootmy canon   fell off not for heavy cameras at all
4825,1,havent used it yet was unpacking for my sons birthday present and was going to put new batteries in it and it had one duracell corroded and one pairdeer brand battery so not happy especially for the price i paidi got a used camera had old corroded batteries in it
9986,5,very convenient and easy to userice cooker
4053,2,if you are looking for a wireless camera to occasionally look at your house this might work for you but if are looking for a true security camera to monitor something this isnt the camera you are looking forthe goodthe setup is simple enough ive read complaints that the instructions in the box are vague but the setup process is really that simple plug stuff in put in the batteries push two buttons to pair the camera and you are done video quality is pretty good since we planned to use the camera outside the lack of audio wasnt an issue i also purchased to outdoor mount which seems sturdy and easy to adjust account setup was easy and the app is decent something to note the main account you create is considered the admin with full access to all the settings you can create other user accounts but even when you designate them as admins they dont get all the settings also only one person can be logged into the main account at one time so it cant be sharedthe badthe first night we logged into the arlo app to see the video quality in the dark we got a message the camera was disconnected the next day we had to remove the cam and repair it with the base i rebooted everything just to be safe by unplugging the base and taking the batteries out of the camera everything worked for about  days and the camera disconnected again about  minutes after we realized it was disconnected we got a message that the batteries were dead no big deal i figured the batteries we just old in the packaging i contacted netgear and they agreed to send me a complimentary set of batteries i had ordered extra anyway and used those to get the camera working everything was working fine we started noticing that the camera would alert us to motion but the video shows us nothing we realized that there is a long delay in the video feed its about  seconds behind live the reason we never saw what was triggering the motion is that by the time whatever tripped the motion sensor and the camera started recording the motion was gone if someone walked up to our door by the time the camera started recording the person was walking away one day it caught our mailman but the only recording we got was him getting back in his truck at the end of sidewalk worthless if you need to identify who came to your door since it starts recording after it senses motion the new set of batteries lasted  days and are dead again after chatting with netgear again they admitted that their battery life estimate is based on less than  minutes of use a day we tried adjusting the recording times and motion settings but nothing helped with the delay this system just doesnt do what it says it doesnetgear supportnetgears support was ok they try to send you to the forums for help but also offer chat they ask you a ton of questions in chat that are not relevant to your issue i know the more info they get the more than can improve but send that in an email survey after the chat sessions they chat agent pasted  questions into the chat window and sent them all at once this was after they had already asked for my netgear account info which had all the info they needednot a security camera
3399,1,got track phone camera quality smhsucks waste of money
3707,1,mine broke when i attached it to my camera the little square that slides into the hotshoe slot was improperly welded and snapped off so now i have no way to attach it to my camera and superglue wont help the brightness is nice but hardware is bad quality wish i had time to exchange it before i photograph a wedding tomorrowbad quality
2742,1,it wont charge it had been on the charger for  hours but wont charge properly would like a new one or at least a refundit wont charge
6242,2,if you like bulk and velco instantaneously out this in your checkout bag i found it hard to use since my main lenses are vintage manual ones it was a bit difficult to focus however if your main purpose is to point and shoot in auto its worth the money i am sure it will save my camera and lenses however for how bulky it is it was a headache to deal with in the rain only time will tellbulky  velco heaven
11218,4,it is small it is transportable it is easy to clean it make perfect  ricei like it very much
14411,1,"bought twothe inner walls of the cooker will start to rust like crazy since this is a steamer it will get into ur foodalso the start button started going bad and the outer case on the top started to pull off after a yearill just take the lost and just go buy a different branddo you like rust"
17168,5,at first i didnt know how to use it no directions really but i tried my first  cups of jasmine rice and had to do it another cycle not enough water or salt was added so use more water then what it lists on the manual other then that i tired again and with jasmine and yellow rice and its super easy now and comes out great best feature you can set to go on certain time to start which works awesome for mu kids they love rice after schoolperfect rice
1743,2,cute but max  i was very excited for this camera only to be let down i loved the retro vibe and thought i was getting a great deal for a very high mp should have known better i had a better point and shoot camera in  not  mp
4174,1,received the item charged and while it lowers on the light doesnt turn on very disappointedbroken
9696,5,had one used it for five years bought this coolest feature is that i can use it to bake a cake love that new featurevery good product
8535,1,the charger for the batter sent is not compatible with my plug here in the us there was nothing stated about choosing a certain country compatible option they sent me a plug that does not fit my outlet rendering the charger useless and therefore i am not able to use the camera without a charged batter i had to contact fujifilm to purchase a whole new battery charger that is compatible with the outlets in the us this cost an additional  sent is not compatible
5409,1,i did not receive this camera un  item was suppose to be at my residents no later than  also when tracking this order it had said i received it on  when i did not again this camera is built cheaplyvery cheap camera
3792,2,this camera takes terrible pictures but my daughter thinks it is fun she is  for kids
13792,5,no need to spend more moneyworks well
17731,5,after a couple of attempts and ending up with wet rice i asked a friend about it and her answer was to measure rice and water  meaning one cup of washed uncooked rice to one cup of water  gave me perfect riceperfect rice
12133,5,"i grew up with rice every day we ate it three times a day and sometimes even for dessert with a little milk and sugar as a parent of three kids rice wasnt on our table as much not because we didnt like it but because it was such a process to get the machine out of the cupboards sometimes buried behind other machines look for all the pieces and make rice the rice was usually scooped from the center and the rest was discarded if there was anything left over it was put in the fridge and if we wanted to eat it again we had to reheat it in the microwave to avoid the hassle we would buy uncle bens instant rice as a quick meal alternative those are two dollars a bag so if we didnt have rice it was because we were too lazy to take it out or too cheap to buy the packetsmy friend posted a review about his rice cooker it was this model and i couldnt believe he spent that much on such a trivial every day appliance he swore by it and i thought he was just being posh fast forward a few years later and i saw a reddit comparison of the  rice cooker versus the  rice cooker it made the same claims that my friend made and i figured i could at least try it from amazon and if it didnt blow my mind away i would send it back i found one on sale  shipped that was definitely easier to justify than the original price the day it arrived i made  cups i follow the instructions exactly i rinsed the rice several times until the water was clear the first batch was jasmine rice i admit i was already expecting to send it back and get my refund after the first bite i realized and wondered if i had ever really eaten rice before every grain from the top to the bottom from side to side was cooked evenly and correctly it was literally the best rice ive ever had as a huge sushi fan i would go to new restaurants and order one spicy tuna roll only after tasting i would either order or or pay and leave because i did not want to waste money on crappy rice this renewed every rice dish i had ever had one of the best features is that after it cooks rice it switches to a keep warm setting that will keep the rice good for up to  to  days if it lasts that long its bound to pay for itself because now we are buying rice in bulk at  a pound i also consider a rice to be part of a healthy diet and we get to have the best rice weve ever tried any time we want amazingthe best rice ive ever had and im asian"
3331,1,little tiny plastic piece of junk i mean i knew it was cheap because of the price but i didnt believe anyone could justify selling something this worthless save yourself the griefwhat a piece of junk
10214,4,i like this rice cooker but i find it a little weird that it doesnt tell you how much time is left when cooking until theres  minutes left and it doesnt always seem clear when its started based on what is lit up it works fine though makes good rice and the water to rice proportions are correctworks but a little confusing
6583,1,when i purchased  cameras for my daughter for christmas the blue tooth from cameras to phones did not work because an update was needed for the snap bridge app we were told the up date would take only a month which ended up being  months once the update came we then were told we had to update the firm ware in the cameras this cause many issues we contacted nikon tech support and they tried everything to fix it at which point he highly adviced us to contact the sell  amazon i spent close to  for both cameras that my daughters could not use as intended now amazon will not reimburse me the full amount they are short by  very disappointent in the product but more disapointed with amazon i have been a prome member for over  years dont buy it and think twice about amazondont buy camera
4791,1,i only received two pack of films which makes it a total of  mini films instead of five packs terrible lying process im returning itmissing films

13997,1,there were many rice cookers to choose from some of them were only  i always trusted the name toshiba and thought i would spend a little bit more money and get a rice cooker that i could rely on well that was a mistake not only did it not work trying to get a refund has been a nightmare initially it was easy to report i was told to send proof of purchase from amazon and did so immediately every day i got an email saying we are waiting for your proof of purchase every day i sent it i finally gave up and called them we received your proof of purchase but its not a pdf but came from your mobile phone must be sent from a computer i explained that i was out of the country and did not have a computer available to me and had no idea why the picture of the proof of purchase i sent was insufficient the customer rep kept insisting it had to be a pdf with no explanation that made any sense whatsoever she finally started to yell at me and when i told her to not yell she told me she was not yelling i told her lets rewind the tape im sure that we are being recorded on and while youre doing that go get a manager manager came on and told me the issue was i couldnt see the picture of the rice cooker on the photo i sent that was just simply incorrect when you download your receipt from amazon the picture is there all the information required was there it was just their way of making sure that you could not comply with whatever it is they wanted so they didnt have to give you a refund i finally texted the proof of purchase to someone not sure if thats gonna work so the rice cooker sucked techsupport sucked and customer support was rude and sucked i will buy the  rice cooker and never buy toshiba anything againtoshiba  cup smallrice cooker
7609,2,cheap qualitythe legs are so weak they wont even stand level and they fall overway too hard to put togethernot worth it
6512,1,i was excited that this might be a good light for my purposes as it had natural daylight leds  k and yellow leds  only the natural daylight leds worked when i would turn the yellow knob from minimum the panel would turn off the battery was fully charged and i tried every combination of settings i returned the light as i needed to be able to blend the two leds to get the right light balance disappointingthe yellow leds did not work
4453,2,while it supports upnp and smb files are still required to be copied to local storage for playback if you have more than the  of files then you may as well just get a regular nonnetwork enabled photo player and a sd cardusb sticknetwork gotchas
7412,2,but my iphone helped making it brighter i took this picture indoors with flash but it looks soo dark ive owned other fujifilm polaroid cameras and they never looked this dark ill try it again outside during the day but so far not impressedi really wanted to love this camera since i bough it to take picture of my new borni wish i could show how dark this image looks in person

13375,5,it is larger than some of the smaller cookers you may find at walmart or similar stores i love it because it is very easy to use and cleaneconomical and robust rice cooker
1410,2,with the external microphone i thought the audio would be better i get better videos from my iphone than this camera its low price so i didnt expect a world class camera but i did expect it to produce a usable  audio quality video choppy and unstable
11544,5,"bought this to replace my instant pot all i needed was a basic rice cooker that did the job without burning this is everything i could want and moreits very sleek and elegant which is nice bc unless u have a lot of storage space in ur kitchen this is going to reside on ur countertop ive got plenty of cabinets so i can tuck it away when not in useit comes with a steamer basket measuring cup and utensils everything is made to be easy to clean just wipe and rinse obvs u can use soap but im avoiding it on the inner cook pot bc its coated with a nonstick material inside and outi try to not use anything even remotely abrasive on those thingsthe directions are sadly lackingtheres zero info on how to use this beyond hit the start to power it up select from the menu button and start again the display is totally not helpful it just will show an l and a red led line will do laps around the screen apparently thats its way of telling you its working i was expecting more but it is what it isthe buttons are odd and kinda creepy its a mix of old  button swathed in plastic overlay and nearlytouchscreenesque what i thought was a label was actually a buttonthats what i mean about touch screenit doesnt look at all like a button anyways its easy to select ur cooking menui did brown rice i saw a video on yt and the person opened the lid and stirred the rice a couple times during the cooking process something you can never ever do with instant pot im not sure if u need to stir or not but i did at some point the rice seemed to be nearly cooked and i was worried it would burn but i let the cycle continue then a  minute timer appeared and it beeped as it counted downthe rice was cooked and it was cooling down or downshifting to keep warm or somethingi think to make sure the excess water is absorbed i opened the lid and stirred againvery fluffy and lovely at the end it beeped and was done my rice was text book perfectfluffy a bit sticky and not a single burnt or overcooked grainprobably the best rice ive ever had outside of a restaurantperfect asianstyle ricenot that sad boxed stuff u can cook in  minutescleanup was easy i put the rice in a big ceramic bowl and washed the cooking pot with water and a clean dish cloth and dried it i used paper towels to wipe and dry the inner pot ring and the edgesit wasnt very damp or dirty just needed to be dried for storage in the cupboardthe inner cooking pot seems like youll need to clean it carefullyi dont know how sturdy that finish is so i say use water and a soft cloththe unit itself is like the  machinesauthentically asianmade so its designed to cook rice properly unlike instant pot if rice is a dietary staple ur gonna know how to cook it properlyand the people who designed this know their stuff when it comes to good sticky riceits going to be fun to try recipes where u add things to rice and steam things on the upper basketoverall this is perfect for making rice and typical asian dishescongee steamed cakes etc i think it probably performs as well as the more expensive machinesi cant imagine they do anything that this cant do it makes a superb pot of ricei think it takes just a few minutes longer than instant potmaybe  minutes more but its  successful doesnt scorch or mess up plus its super quietinstant pot can be hissy beepy and irritatingbesides the whole burn everything or blow itself up thingnot at all an instant pot fan this however is light years ahead of ip and makes amazing ricethe price is insanely lowid grab one for anybody u know who cooks rice a lotsuper great deal on a fab machine my new fave kitchen gadget and thats from someone who hates to cook def a must have applianceamazing"
8230,2,i bought this camera to use on the handlebars of my bike the battery lasted all day but due to the terrible state of neglected scottish roads the vibration causes the image to be unstable therefore car number plates are difficult to read the camera might be better fixed on the helmet although the camera is quite heavy compared to some it does seem quite well made so i hope it lasts longer than my previous drift ghost camera which stopped working  week after the warranty ran out unfortunately this was not the case it broke down  months after purchasing the menu led screen stopped workiing so i could not change the settings i had to return to amazon as drift were not really that helpful thank goodness for amazon who were very helpful 
15317,5,first pot roast in the machine and it kicked the higher end named brand units in the teeth we bought it for rice but man it is versatile and cooks everything we have thrown at it so bloody happy with the purchase do not hesitate to buy this do it youll thank us later cheerstotally exceeded my expectations
14756,5,very simple instructions so happy with this rice cooker its just the  of us so we didnt need the  rice cooker we had a cheap one for years i had a zojirushi since the  that i loved but when i moved to ny  years ago it was packed in the meantime i bought a  one from somewhere i hated it because there was always a layer of burned rice on the bottom even if i unplugged it immediately after cooking the warm setting just burned more rice but it basically worked so i didnt want to buy a new one but then my son dropped it and broke the lid so we used the opportunity to buy this one upon recommendation from a friend a little less expensive then the one i was eyeing for the past  years from the very first batch of perfectly cooked nothing wasted rice i am in loveamazing rice cooker
9702,4,had always cooked rice oats quinoa grains in a saucepan but saw someone using this aroma electric cooker and was amazed by how quickly it made four cups of rice small sixe  there is a larger one  and how inexpensive it was cooker has settings for white and brown rice oats and other grains comes with a steamer tray for veggies or whatever up top measuring cup and rice paddle the rice cooks up quickly and beautifully when done the cooker automatically goes to stay warm mode until youre ready to eat easiest cooker ever love iteasiest way to make fluffy rice or steelcut oats in short time
3939,1,camera was great until it stopped working out of nowhere tried to replace batteries as suggested online but the lights on lens keep flashing cannot troubleshoot any further than replace batteries with new ones or return to fuji store honestly not worth buying with running the risk of getting a faulty camera that will cost more to fix than replace my  old is so upsetstopped working

14729,5,i really wanted to buy the zojirishi rice cooker but the  price tag was off putting so we took a chance on this cooker and my wife and i have been so happy the rice cooks amazing soft fluffy white rice that isnt mushy i am even eating more rice because its that darn good my wife is the big ricerl eater in the house and she loves it too the rice pot is thick and sturdy not flimsy garbage and the breakdown for cleaning is super easy it has the fuzzy logic of the higher price models too we have ours dialed it perfectly for our taste and everytime the rice comes out amazing and my wife loves it because she has warm rice ready for her in the morning if you are in the market for a rice cooker buy this you wont be disappointed i just wish they had other colors available for this model thats literally my only gripe about itas good as the zojirishi for a fraction of the price

8284,1,once the initial battery charge from factory has gone the camera doesnt charge anymore  i have tried with different cables and power suppy unitscharging problem
7490,2,i bought this camera as a replacement for an aging gopro that was working intermittently seemed to get good reviews and since it worked with my existing gopro mounts and accessories i thought i would give it a try let me first say this is not a gopro the feel of the buttons is cheap the unit itself must weigh half of what my gopro does the accessories are cheap and poorly fitting and the nuts on the mounts that keep falling off it provides a number of different video formats but everything is recorded in mov format there is not an option for  even though it says it in the listing and on the companys website the video quality and sound seem to be ok but you cannot offload the videos to your computer by plugging the camera in via usb you have to remove the sd card and use a reader to get the videos to your computer supposedly you can use their app to offload the videos to your mobile device but i am not going to store this volume to data on my mobile device overall the app is junk after i finally figured out which app there are multiple works with which camera i could not get it to stay connected for more than  seconds via wifi i punished my gopro or years and it held up great i dont expect this one to last very long if you are looking for a cheap camera to take some decent videos and then offload to your computer some way i guess this camera is fine if you expect quality features and functionality and an app that works consistently  keep lookingok but far from a replacement for a real gopro
2477,1,camera quality isnt the best it was working fine when i got it and now all i can see is a black screen and nothing happens it just stays that way ive had it for two days and dont want to hassle with iti wouldnt recommend

12096,5,"the beauty of japanese rice cookers is that there is no secret to them there is nothing that you need to be intheknow about to get perfect restaurant quality rice you clean the rice you add water you push a button one hour later perfectionrice cookers are believe it or not one of the few products that was not only invented but also perfected in japan the first rice cooker was actually invented by toshiba after testing from a husband and wife couple got all the kinks out of a special switch that turned off the heat at just the right moment but in japanese postwar economy everyone was worker and not everyone could eat dinner at the right time keeping rice not only cooked but also hot and ready to eat for long periods of time became the new challengecertain companies that worked in vacuum flask container manufacturing stepped in which is how companies like zojirushi and tiger become the giants they are today if you want a mainstream rice cooker you choice is going to be between the two zojirushi has a much larger presence in the us market and well i am kind of a fan this is not my only zoji product i have a hot water pot lunch box and several vacuum flasks that i swear must use magic to keep things as hot or cold as they do for so longwhile we dont eat rice with every meal the ease of which you can just add rice as a side dish is greatfeature wise the keep warm feature is just fantastic often times i will cook rice for lunch and the just leave the left over rice in the pot for dinner later on the rice always has that just cooked fresh from the steamer taste compared to some cheaper rice cookers that use the olderoriginal toshiba technology this is one of the key features that you are spending the extra money forthe other feature that you are spending the extra money for is the fuzzylogic computer on board basically the way it works is that it takes environmental temperature readings takes into account how fast the water is boiling and adjusts the cooking time and heat to cook the rice in such a way that it will be perfect every time this is what makes the machine push the on button and walk awaythe pan is incredibly easy to clean just some hot water and soap swished around is often enough to clean it you should rarely have to use a sponge i know many reviewers have complained about the lining peeling off after a year or so zoji sells replacement pots on their website for around  dollars just make sure that you never use any metal on the pan and you should be good to go for many years before you need a new panthe cord has a feature similar to the automatic whined up on older vacuum cleaners it makes storage a breeze and the handle on the top is very nice too the inner steam suppression lid is also super easy to take off and clean between uses as well the addition of a steamer tray is a fantastic feature tooyou should check out some youtube videos for ricecooker recipes many japanese homemakers have figured out interesting ways too cook different meals very easily with an appliance that is in every japanese homeall and all money well spent if you want one less thing to worry about when cooking dinnerperfect rice every time"
6031,2,well three months of kids enjoying games and capturing odd and interesting photos they arent bad but are no prize for printing quality thats for sureworst though this camera charging port sunk in when i tried to charge it and there is no way to get the port back in place to recharge so a waist of money so far we have two other children that have an alike camera that didnt have this happen but a simple defect like this and there hasnt been a way to communicate to anyone about getting help to repair fix or replace it im bummed so i hope others dont have this issue or are at least cautious when purchasing this thingunrepairable plastic camera

6001,1,thought id enter the action camera world by playing it safe with a well known popular brand like gopro bought the gopro hero  black i guess i missed the negative reviews regarding it overheating took it out in an air conditioned car for its trial test run using different resolutions  fps etc after  minutes the camera flashed a message that it was overheated and was shutting down couldnt get it to turn on after that googled the issue and then found the complaints of similar problems with this model product returned ordered a hero  black for one last chance with a gopro fingers crossed amazon service was great as usual

14991,5,"when our  year old rice cooker finally kicked the bucket we were astonished to find that nearly every rice cooker out there in the market was now digital with a ridiculous amount of buttons what happened to the basic models with an cooking oncooking off switch and a warming functionwe read reviews on the few simpler models that were available and read horror stories of shoddy construction or messy spray from the venting holes we were just about to give up looking when we came along this little gemwe never make more than two cups of rice at a time uncooked so even though the model was a bit smaller than our last rice cooker we knew it would work a charm sizewise it is nice that it takes up a little less spacefor our test spin we made coconut jasmine rice two cups of jasmine rice with two cups of coconut water with the pulp plus a bit of salt to bring out the flavours poured the ingredients in flicked the switch on and soon the house was filled with the mouthwatering fragrance of the cooked rice no sprays no intense temps just great rice the way we like itwhat can we say most of the time in life simple works so far we simply couldnt be happier with our new rice cookerwe hope that this purchase lasts a good timesimple works"
145,1,i got taken in by all the great reviews and ads for this camera i am sorely disappointed with this camera yes its very easy to use but thats it the pictures are neither clear nor vibrant i used up  film taken outside and inside and they all had the same washed out look how is this camera getting such great hype i returned the camera and the extra film i purchasednot the best
2592,1,the photos from this camera compared to the  are absolutely awful less in focus no adjustments available much warmer and far darker i do not recommend this i bought it to replace my  that i dropped in a pool and i regret it save yourself the money and buy an older versionterrible compared to older versions
10119,5,just what i needed easy to use and clean and makes rice perfectly every time its small enough to put away when its not in use definitely a great purchase and tool to have in any kitchenlove it
2377,1,camera broken after two months and only  pictures was christmas gift for my daughtercamera broken after two months and only  pictures was christmas gift for my daughter
11414,5,this little machine is worth buying its easy to use clean and store there are different functions for whatever youre cooking you just press the button and the cooker does everything for you i would definitely recommend this to anyonegreat product
9897,5,honestly this is the best rice cooker hands down this one is so easy to use nothing sticks to it i never put it in the dishwasher and always clean with a soft sponge cooks rice in about  min comes with rice cup for accurate measuringbuy it now
12073,5,this makes the best rice ive ever had its not mushy or dry and makes completely unbroken nonclumped perfectly cooked rice it does however take longer than cooking on stove top but the fact that you dont have to pay any attention to it whatsoever easily outweighs thatnearly perfect
9977,4,first time using a rice cooker made shrimp jambalaya wi rice was perfectly cooked  not burnt or soggy  easy to clean used my own recipe but followed the cooker guidelines for water to rice ratio and came out great  good buy one note really needs a great recipe book to go with a great rice cookerperfectly cooked rice 
685,2,very complicated for a seniortoo complicated
3285,1,the camera itself was a moderate quality and came with an extra lens and two batteries when i shot photographs inside it would not focus in completely and left my photos over pixelated i tried going outside and shooting in the sunlight and again it would not focus completely in on the subject i returned this camera with no problemsdid not go into focus
907,2,the video quality was grainy and although i had asked if the autofocus could be locked to a fixed spot like on iphones and was told yes by the seller i was not able to find this function anywhere i read through the manual multiple times and went through all of the settings the overall feel of the camera is cheap the buttons were wiggly the handle strap was flimsy and it just wasnt great quality i returned itits not great
10109,5,i dont cook much but i want to start saving money and stop eating so much junk food since i like rice i decided getting a rice cooker was the best way to make my own rice and this one is rather small but it gets the job done makes a good bit of rice especially for a single persongreat for noncookers
13052,5," cups of rice is a monumental amount of food this rice cooker did a fantastic job cooking it correctly and perfectly each time i used itoperation can take a little bit of time to get used to but the instructions are fantastic i have not tried oatmeal in this and to be honest probably wont because i find it easier and faster on the stove but rice aint the only thing this baby can cookso this is a really good rice cooker perfect for serving massive amounts of carbs stars recommendedmakes a huge amount of rice"
2300,1,too bad service bad quality please dont purchase any one this product is to bad quality nathing in side ok very bad service also seller and amazon customer care also bad service 
6473,2,ive had this for more than a year now and have third followup complaint if you dont use this light for several weeks the battery dies completely theres something in the light causing it to slowly drain which is frustrating and annoying you cannot charge it and then expect to be able to use it several weeks lateroriginal review followstwo  both potentiometers knobs feel  wont attach to any of the stands or mounts that i have  inch and  inch so i have to order some  ball joint is about as cheap as can be get something better i did glad i didadditional thoughtsgets really hot while charging  havent really used it much yet so i cant comment on battery life as long as it works almost as well as advertised i think this is probably a pretty good dealsome complaints
3936,1,i guess i got a bad one it didnt work what a bummer it was a gift for my baby  birthday which is todaywhat a bummer
8820,1,returned itwasnt pleased
4868,1,trying to scam only comes with  boxes of films not 
15398,5,i read the instructions when i got it and used the cooker for the first time the next day i quickly figured out i had completely wasted my time reading the instructions because i had obviously slept since then that being said it did make it a lot easier to find what i needed in the book even if i couldnt remember any of it i bought a pressure cooker cookbook and it worked out well with the instruction booklet so now i keep them together even though the cookbook had a different brand name on it the concept was the same and it worked out fine i went with this brand of cooker because of the bad reviews for the well known brand that said it broke the first time or it had some problem or another i am not sure but i suspect that these cookers are all made in a very few factories with different labelling on them and this brand had great reviews if there were only a few of them i will say that mine worked great no problems at all and the ribs were fantastic even if i do say so myself these are handy to have and this is a cheaper version with yet another great reviewreally worked out great

931,1,not greatnot a great buy
11078,5,i love it  easy  efficient simple and multipurpose kitchen appliances  buy buygreat rice cooker
677,1,i got this camera knowing it would be low quality but i was still expecting way better than what i got super cheap feeling in your hands with the plastic body and knobs at the top even though there are barely any settings or options to play around with it is still cumbersome operating with unintuitive slow buttons etc the shutter is so slow you basically miss every shot you want or people are frozen waiting for you to say ok i got it and even then the focus looks off then you look at the picture and its just horrible the quality is like when they first put cameras into phones i saw someone else say clearly a webcame in a plastic body and that has to be what it isnot sure how there are good reviews possibly they shipped a different built camera and then they started making them cheaper and selling it as the same product but the one i got was a joke i got it sort of as a goof for a friends wedding something easy to pass around and get a lot of fun party shots but i only ended up taking  pictures with it in  days  bummerkinda funny
14598,5,nice compact  holds to  cups of rice but not  with the steamer attachment good item for the price it accommodates my boyfriend and using it about twice a day sometimes the rice can be on the drier side tho sometimesthis little thing is super lit
12745,5,my son actually ordered this and we use it  times a week easy to use and clean you do need to wipe the inside of the cover which can be a little bit of a paindidnt know i needed one

14819,5,best rice cooker ever purchasedcooks the best rice
5995,1,do not buy this camera worst picture quality fake description about waterproof technology rude customer services no quality services and poor video quality as compared to other competitors i bought last year and i have all receipts and everything do not prefer gopro anymore they used to have good cameras but not anymore wasting moneyworst picture quality fake waterproof slogan
17270,5,its quite big but does as little as one cup of rice perfectly every timethis is a great rice cooker set it and forget it
16216,4,honestly for the price what do you expect my only disappointment is compared to my other  cup cooker this one doesnt give you an auditory sound to tell you its done where as my other one will beep loud enough to hear across the house luckily i only got this one as a backup for when i forget to clean the other one and really want some ricewhy no beep
10962,4,although this is very easy to use and clean major pints for that if you ever try to cook more than two cups it doesnt fully cook evenly we love it otherwisedont do more than  cups

2612,1,the fuji instax pack film was incomplete just  slides were received and now i cant apply for refund or return the item because it is a giftmissing items
15397,5,to be fair this rice cooker is far larger than i need  cups of rice is plenty for me but when i entertain i prefer to make big meals so this helps first batch came out glistening and better than anything i did with pots on a stove i use a little more water than the measurements suggest its measuring based off the level of water and rice used to make a full cooked batch ie the  cup mark is how much youd use for  cups of cooked rice using  cups dry and  cups water thats how ive used it and the rice glistens like ive never seen before even my cheap rice tasted pretty darn good for once i then used the steamer for  minutes to make some pork buns and dumplings and decided to test the timer function too its easier than i thought based on the instructions i set up whatever im gonna do like select steam set time and when id otherwise his start i hit timer and set it for whatever then hit start worked great fresh food ready in time for when i woke up for workwell and right for me
7148,1,we are making a wall board and after we loaded the film it stated on our phone screen that it was the wrong film we bought the bundled package with the film and the printer so it made no sense i have tried to reach them repeatedly to help us to no avail i should have bought the kodak choice instead this is a  nightmareinstax encourages you to buy the bundle but film is not compatible
6443,1,i got this camera to get pictures and video of the sky when i got it i bought a sd card sold separately it was too large memory capacity i didnt know that was possible so i got a new sd card the camera took a few pictures and video to test it out when i got to my computer i couldnt figure out how to get the pictures out because you cant take them off while its in the camera the camera doesnt work without the sd card the sd card moved to the computer showed empty files when the camera said theyre there the quality of the pictures is awful anyway there is only  buttons and the instructions were vaguenot worth buying
3716,1,the actual unit works but the charger doesnt now i have to spend more money to buy another battery charger which is more expensive than this entire unit waste of timebattery charger defective
13294,1,amazon box was in tact so not sure what went on this arrived with the bottom detached and electronics hanging out the exterior is made of cheap plastic and thin metal sheeting around the body that had dents and seams were not secure there was no chord scooper or measuring cup and box looked like it had been in a garage for years even if it had not arrived in this condition i have a real japanese rice cooker that makes this one look like something youd find in the dollar isle at walmart cheap flimsy and just junk i bought this for my daughter in college for easter needless to say i will not get a replacement i would have selected  stars if i could havemade of plastic and thin metal that obviously breaks easily
6614,2,bought for daughters christmas present and due to software issues camera will not connect to iphone xr called nikon numerous times and they stated firmware would be fixed and to date still has not been addressed buyer beware and if you are looking for connectivity with phone as stated research before purchasingsoftware and connectivity issue
14984,5,  minutes and rice are done  easy to clean and keeping at the countervery easy
5401,1,when i first started it up everything loaded up perfectly fine tested it by taking some pictures of my cat but the display screen turned off and wont turn back on unless i take the sd card out weve tried everything and its not an issue with the battery or it not being charged the display screen just literally wont turn on unless the sd card is taken out of the camera and to save any pictures you need the sd card in it so its literally pointless the pictures are also very blurry and not good quality will be returningdoesnt turn on with sd card
279,2,i was hoping to use this for my blog and vlogging that others mentioned it being great for but picture quality was very grainy it has to be used in natural daylight unfortunately or else it just is no better than ur phone camera in fact my iphone camera is better disappointed
2684,2,pluses simple to use with selfie camera and lots of filtersstickers to add to photos  year old enjoyed it while it worked comes with a  memory card and store  of thousands of imagescons the first one worked for a day or two but then the memory card was no longer recognizes and felt very hot to the touch its possible the camera was fine and just the memory card but decided to return and received another the second one worked for longer and no issues with memory card but it would freeze to the point it couldnt even be turned off so only remedy was to wait until the batter completely drainedperhaps i was just unlucky but am not going for a  attempttwo defective items giving up
5654,1,be very cautious buying this camera i can take way better pictures with my cell phone then when i went to hook it up to my computer to do live videos for my company it crashed my new business computer i still havent got it fixed hopefully this camera didnt ruin my computer toonot  pictures and crashed my brand new computer
1654,1,the camera powered on but the main menu would not appear on the screen the directions stated the camera will enter menu when powered on but the menu never appeared i could however take photos while it was on but couldnt navigate through the menu or change to camera mode or even see what i was taking a picture of the packaging was nice but i could not troubleshoot why the screen remained blankscreen did not show the main menu

315,1,camera appears to have an incredible range of features but how to use them it didnt work reliably even as a plain point and shoot some functions were not repeatable others once chosen could not be unchosen the only way i found to get out of some options and into others was restoring factory settings that got old fast i have never seen such a mess of an interface the manual printed from the web is  pages and full of footnotes lifes too short maybe the firmware is buggy this opinion is based on shooting stills did not try videos i had bought from a local store and returned it for a refundcamera appears to have an incredible range of features

80,1,after unboxing and using this camera the most important thing i can say is that i dont believe any of the other reviews are honestthis camera is unsuitable for taking photos for any purpose i dont care if this is used by a five year old to introduce the kid to photography  it is not even good enough for that give him or her an old iphone  or galaxy  to play withthe listing boasts fhd  mp and  based on the tiny file sizes i do not know how the camera can possibly be capturing  mp of data perhaps it is capturing  mp of data then compressing the file size into oblivion but i cant explain itthe reason i bought this camera was because of the sample images in the listing which were clear and full of bright colorsthe images this camera takes are about the equivalent of a polaroid or of the old old  instamaticthe images are grainy even under the best circumstances one reviewer commented that this camera appealed to younger photo takers looking for that retro look ive been involved in photography for  years and ive never known the retro look to mean poor quality washed out and grainy images and if that is what you are looking for you should still always start with a quality image then manipulate the quality image to get the retro or modern or classical look you want take a crappy photo and you have no options  take a quality photo and you have unlimited optionsi see no utility for this camera of any kind if you buy it i will bet after one or two uses youll realize you made a mistakeif you are buying it because its all you can afford save your money for now and get a name brand when you can afford it that is what im going to docould be good for a five year old  but maybe not

13787,5," i recently purchased the toshiba lowcarb rice cooker which has been a gamechanger for my daily diet ive been using it for almost a month now and i must tell that im pretty impressed the lowcarb functionality distinguishes it from other rice cookers on the marketthe cooking procedure is basic and straightforward the rice cooker comes with clear instructions making it simple to use this rice cooker produces excellent rice the rice is fluffy perfectly cooked and has the right texture in the lowcarb mode which helps me keep a healthier lifestylethe rice cookers design is sleek and modern making it a fantastic addition to any kitchen the size is ideal for a small family and the titanium nonstick inner pot seems and feels very premium but in stainless steel for lowcarb mode you would find the rice sticks if you arent using the warm feature i suggest you transfer all the rice to a nonstick pot after cooking with stainless steeloverall i would strongly recommend the toshiba lowcarb rice cooker to anyone searching for a highquality rice cooker with unique features it has exceeded my expectations and i am convinced that it will also exceed yoursexceed my expectations"

4953,1,update  i am currently in ireland and the camera is not working the screen is not showing anything other than the menu options if i try to take a photo its completely black tried different setting removing the battery and memory card and even did thefactory reset nothing so it is useless  months after purchasing itbought this specifically for a trip to africa and it worked very well i made sure i had extra batteries with me and was able to take  photos using a  chip my only complaint was that the screen is very hard to see in sunny situations it would have been nice to have an actual viewfinder on those days zoom was incredible for not having to lug around a big lens the two lion photos give you a good idea of how close you can get even the detail on mt kenya was amazingupdatedworked very well until it didnt

17488,5,"for years my partner and i had the micom heating zojirushi rice cooker while it made decent rice and was a workhorse it was coming up on ten years old and the rice would often be mushy as the water would not be fully absorbed i had been tracking the price of this rice cooker which can fluctuate   and got it for a decent price while it is definitely expensive for a rice cooker if you eat rice daily like my partner and i do then i think it is definitely worth it value wisethe rice itself comes out perfect every time whether it is brown white or any of the other settings we have tried the rice comes out nearly as good as cooking in a kamadosan donabe the water gets completely absorbed and the induction heating component definitely makes a difference the  rice cup size is also ideal for making rice for several mealsall in all id say monitor the price and make the purchase if you eat rice frequently and have been hesitant to pull the triggerworth the investment"
12909,5,"review for cosori rice cooker  cup uncooked rice maker with  cooking functions advanced fuzzy logic micom technology texture optional  recipes keep warm delay timer stainless steel steamerthis  cosori rice cooker is so much more than a rice cooker we have been using this for a while now and still have a lot to learn about it this is a premium cooker with tons of features i have never been able to fully cook rice because it always comes out with some hard grains in it with this cooker cooking rice is a breeze the measurements on the cooker are precise i use the keep warm feature a lot i have used the oatmeal function i handwash the cooker instead of using my dishwasher clean up is a breeze this is a welcome addition to my kitchenso much more than a rice cooker  cosori  cup rice cooker"

12783,5,for the money this is the best rice cooker i have found it is slower than most especially its brown rice which is the only rice we make but it does a great job and the texture of the rice is perfect every time takes an hour and twenty minutes to cook two cups of raw rice which is about twice the time our old cooker tookbest deal out there
4736,1,this shows a photo of a camera strap charging cable and memory card none of which was included in the packagedid not include accessories as pictured
4622,2,this adapter is ok with sd cards seems to read fast the only complaint i would have for design is that its way too easy to lose the caps since theres no place to put themhowever  theres a huge flaw while it reads sd well enough it utterly fails to read any mico sd card i have tried in any computer i have tried i just hear the connecting beep from the computer followed by disconnecting a moment later then it cycles indefinitely until i remove the adapterit would have been nice enough if it only worked as described im giving it  stars instead of one simply because it did work with sdreads sd fails to read microsd

14190,5,i want to use this every day and rice has become my favorite food the same every single time no burnt bottomperfectly soft rice
11340,5,not only that this matched my other small appliances this cute rice cooker gives me just the right size and perfect cooked rice the way i want and it stays warm for  hours once the rice is cooked the digital timer starts to move forward to  hours count down then it shuts off cleaning is easy and since i only cooked white rice on it i cleansed the inside of the bowl with slightly soapy soft cloth rinse well and dry and check the bottom of the nesting chamber to make sure theres no rice granules that dropped and also wiped dry the upper lid from the steam build up after each use and before storing also before placing the bowl inside the canister whether cooking or storing make sure to wipe the bowl dry as water drops could stain the metal base of the cooking chamber and place this appliance in a safe area as steam blows once it starts boiling process of course dont forget to enjoy this delicious riceother food you could cook as recommended by the makermanufacturerright for price
9064,1,the film looks like its really old your pictures come out looking like theyre from  theres big spots at the top and theres streaks through the pictures it was really bad because we took it to a wedding for some of the wedding pictures and so we got really crappy pictures out of it really not worth the money at all not unless you want pictures that look like theyre from  with streaks through themnot worth the money

12792,5,most importantly we wanted a stainless steel steamer basket the style of the cosori is handsome enough to leave on the counter so far ive cooked farro wild rice brown rice steel cut oats  quinoa without any problems nothing sticks to the inner pot the steamer basket is nice and large the lid took me awhile to figure out how to take it apart to clean but it helped when i wore my reading glasses and paid attention to the arrows we love the cosori rice cooker
12292,5,brown rice takes a long time over  minutes to cook other than that the white rice didnt take too long and came out nice and fluffysimple rice cooker makes great rice
14854,5,this rice cooker is incredibly convenient taking only  minutes to cook the rice its compact cute design allows for effortless storage and cleaning moreover it consistently prepares the rice flawlessly alleviating any concerns about undercooking or overcookingfast and convenient

12712,5,we have used this for broccoli and rice so far and it makes the broccoli so soft but not mushy i love thiseasy to useclean
620,1,this camera is very poor quality it was given as a gift for christmas and the video sound stopped working only a month after it was given i would not recommend this productpoor quality
7876,2,this is a cool little printer and small it is the general idea seems to be a carry with you printer thatll print these smallish  printer that have adhesive back and can then be put on the back of your phone a board and suchidea is great and for the most part it succeeds in its mission it unfortunately misses in its most important part faithful reproduction of the picture i skews the color profile making it way too warm to the point of it becoming unpleasantif this was the only option out there itd be great but it isnt funny thing is that kodak makes a small  size camera with builtin printer that does a significantly better job for only a few dollars more it is even a  dyesub printer that gives much better results not obvious why they chose not to do just the printer part of that solution herein short look elsewherecool printer  poor results
15579,5,my family eats rice every day and we have a larger rice cooker that cooks on a timer and keeps the rice warm for hours after but when we travel we usually have to get instant rice this little cooker is perfect it cooks  cups of rice prefect and will cook different types of rice if needed super easy to pack and clean it will work well as a daily use item too if needed great little rice cooker i would recommendgreat for travel
14033,5,the fuzzy logic cook works great although it takes longer than dumb cookers but that is the price for perfect rice the timed start is a little confusing to program the undocumented time on keep warm lets you know how long it has been foreasy to use easy to clean
17152,5,"when i got this i was looking for a faster cooking rice maker i didnt read completely and this is not it however i am not going to complain because my rice came out fine i have an instant pot and i try to make rice in it and always fail and burn things so i was a little hesitant to get this zest by instant pot cause why on earth do i need more than one kinf od instant pot well it works pretty good i added my rice and waited for the timer to go offwhich was about  minutes or so i didnt really time it but that is about the timeframe i did  cup of rice and  cup of water though i think the instructions said something about   it didnt stick to the pot like my instant pot had done previously the rice itself was a little over cooked but i think maybe adding less water just a smidge would have fixed that i mean i didnt measure  accurately so that could have made the difference i did wash my rice before hand which truthfully i rarely ever doi didnt have the spewing at the top like others have said i even put a paper towel down just in case there was nothing on it the whole system cleaned super easy as well so i would for sure by it again i have used it about  times now for different thingsrice oatmeal quinoa and even made a sauce in iti got the  which is really  cups dry rice it was smaller than i thought it would be but actually works out because my family eats way to much rice the keep warm setting though i dont think you should use for long periods cause it will keep cooking the items in the pot so be careful with thatworked great little slow"
11231,2,touch screen stopped working into a month only no use after thatnot worth it
854,1,ordered for a photo but many photos do not appear very disappointingordered for a photo but many photos do not appear very disappointing
9735,5,if you like rice buy this comes out perfect everytime and we can now make risotto at home easy to clean easy to usebest purchase ever
14392,4,i like toshiba and it is a good product the only thing i dont like about it is that it takes too long to cook the rice it takes one hour to cook while it takes other brands between  to  minutes to me it does not matter what electric rice cookers brand you use the rice would still turn out to be the same if you follow the instruction correctlytake little too long to cook
17140,5,"this small appliance has a bit of a learning curve and i had to go to the internet because the user manual is lacking but there are many things i like about this kitchen tool the sautesear function i made a pot roast and it was so nice to sear the meat first and then just throw in the juices and veggies turned out perfect sear heats to  so dont throw in your meat and walk away the slow cooker function heats to  this is just slightly above a normal slow cooker low of  which is what i like to use but if youre in a hurry or short of time there is a manual mode where you can adjust the temperature higher just be careful manual mode  reaches  cooking time and temps can be adjusted this comes with very clever silicone handle holders which you just slip on the hot handles if you need to lift the pot outand a round silicone pad to set the hot pot upon from kitchen to tablealthough the function says slow cooker like the instant pot this only heats from the bottom put thicker denser items on bottom and i wouldnt advise cooking without liquids included i also stir periodically also as said if you need a higher heat use manual modei advise playing around with the different modes before adding ingredients adjusting timestemps took some practice and although i read there is a manual mode    i havent found  yet and dont expect the timer sound to be very audible typical ip volumethis all being said the more i use it the more i appreciate what it can do but i still have my slow cooker because sometimes i want that allaround heatnice addition to my kitchen appliances"
14782,5,such a great rice cooker as with most rice cookers it does keep the rice warm after it finishes cooking but whats great is that there is a little screen that tells you how long the rice has been on the warmer the only downside is that it does reset after hitting about three days but real talk would you even keep rice in your cooker for more than that it was priced about  less than what i have seen in local storesfantastic cooker
6012,1,was excited to get the camera at such a great prince turned out not to be such a great deal battery charged but camera kept turning off within seconds of turning on had to return itdisappointed
14879,5,"i didnt get this for rice rather i got it to melt beeswax so i got the cheapest one i could find i didnt have the time to melt the beeswax so i actually tried it for cooking rice and was i pleasantly surprised its not fancy but it does the job it has done so well that i have kept using it as a rice cooker it definitely as some quirks but overall it works wellas with any of these rice cookers they have their own measuring device so you cant just put in  cup of rice and cups of water you have to use their international rice measuring tool it tells you this up front but the goofiness of it didnt strike me until i got it and then forgot where i put the little measuring cup this is not just a drawback of this cooker its the same with all of them evidently there is some fancy international standard for how to cook rice soheres a trick just put in a cup of rice and then put water in until it is over the rice by one finger tip just stick your finger in and if it comes up to the first joint you are good to go it has some different criteria for brown rice but i just ignore that and go with the finger methodthe other annoying thing is that there is no automatic shut off or alarm when the rice is cooked it just has an on switch and its either cooking or keep warm if you dont turn it off the rice will be a bit burnt down at the bottom this is a minor annoyance and i just set a timer for  minutes so its definitely not a deal breakersoif you want a great value on a rice cooker give this one a dance it does a great job and it doesnt cost an arm and a leg its definitely something i would buy again and hopefully it will work well onthe bees wax too but when i use it for bees wax its no longer going to be useful for rice so ill just buy another onenice little rice cooker"
6641,1,all camera functions works as expected when camera is operable this item did not survive a year with no issue seems like this products issue was never addressedthen  a no longer serviceable at any center except in caservice center
3337,1,this camera is such junk plastic so it feels like a toy screen is unclear the video has no sound i wasted my moneydont waste your money
5223,1,literally did not work had to return this product and it says a lot because im typically too lazy to return amazon stuffjunk
6816,1,it came pretty quickly when i first opened the package it seemed nice for the price but i couldnt even open the battery compartment and the manualtroubleshooting is very vague and repetitive i had to ask multiple people to help me open it i finally got it open put the batteries in successfully by the time i was trying to jam the microsd card into the camera i was already regretting buying this camera the card wouldnt even fit all the way into the slot yes it clicked but the battery compartment wouldnt close over it it got stuck in the card slot and i had to pluck it out with tweezers this was a mistake because the microsd card broke in half inside of the camera and i still havent gotten it out hopefully i can still return it or i would have waisted  on a broken camera and frustrsationdo not buy this camera
15539,4,"this rice cooker is a simple and straightforward way to cook rice it has just one button to push and it cooks rice very well it quickly cooks a maximum of  cups of rice and the cooked rice slides out easily as claimed the pot is lightweight and has a special coating the water guide is marked on one side only and since the pot is nonstick it is easy to wash with no scrubbing requiredi didnt like the rice scooper it looked cheap and had a sharp plastic material on the handle i also think that it is overpriced compared to other products that offer exactly the same featuresa nononsense way to cook rice"
2621,2,got this for xmas worked great for about a month and then unsolvable issues since only takes certain batteries and now the light for ready just freaks out i tried looking it up and different batteriesfilm but nothing works dont make them like they used to  total waste as far as im concerned and i was so looking forward to a throwback works very short term

729,1,this is a terrible camera the photos are terrible the set up is not the least user friendly nothing about this camera is easy or useful the sd card is open to air you have to hold the button so long to get the photo take everyone is gone it doesnt hold settings i bought it as a gift and unfortunately the return window is passed horrible productif i could give it zero stars i would
9934,5,"i had been making rice in the southern georgia traditional way for years using the absorption method boil a pot of water put the rice in the water and cook it till its done every pot of rice with that method came out different in consistency every time sometimes it was ok and sometimes the rice was horriblei love japanese hibachi but it is pretty pricy in a restaurant so i wanted to learn how to cook it myself at home and get as close as possible this rice cooker made all the difference in the world its well worth the pricesooo glad i decided to buy a rice cooker"
13571,5,"two years later and still love this rice cooker used it  for the  months solid the guest teacher lived with us and now much less frequently but it has held up well and not let us down below is my original review which still standsive always made rice on the stove and hesitated to get another appliance to take up space on my counter but we are host family for a year to a young woman from china and it was difficult for her to live without one given that she makes rice daily we ordered this model based on amazon reviews thank you everyone for your valuable input and have been loving it this past week on its maiden voyage i followed the directions to rinse the white rice and made  cups i cut up a sweet potatoe into about  wide slices and put them in the steamer for the full cooking time both the rice and sp were perfect the skin was super easy to peel off the cooked sp and it was an easy healthy and tasty side dish that required no oil salt etc that you usually use when cooking side veggiesafter a few days of successful white rice i tried out brown equally easy and fast i wasnt sure how it could cook in the same amount of time but it did i think i used a little extra water for the brown but am still experimenting follow up  years later  white and brown cooks equally well and i dont vary the amount of water used it just seems to know when its done i have noticed that we cook a maximum of  measuring cups for our  person meals and none of the prior posts about rice boiling over discuss quantity cooked the brown bubbled a lot but didnt bubble over it may be that people cooking for larger groups need a larger cooker and if we were doing larger quantities we might have the bubbling over problem too but with rinsing and smaller quantities it has not been an issue also the measuring cup that comes with it is not an exact cup so some may want to experiment to figure out what the actual true cup measurements are for the cup provided and the lines inside the cookeri love the glass lid because i can see whats going on in there it would be interesting to hear from others who are making veggies and other things like the person who makes a boiled egg using the steamer also it puts out a lot of steam so do be sure youre not placing it right under a counter as youll probably end up with a nasty mess growing under your counter from the intense output of steam that happens mostly in the first half of cooking our cooker sits on a counter with lots of clearance aboveperfect white and brown rice and steamed sweet potato"
14127,5,this rice cooker is perfect for making quick rice and or oatmeal i really like the size of the rice cooker doesnt take up too much countertop room tried it out for the first time and it worked great 
7897,2,when the printer is working it prints great with good quality pictures but ive been having an issue where the printer only prints half of the picture and is wasting my printer sheets that arent cheap i purchased a used printer so i think this is definitely apart of the problemproscons
5574,1,on the picture it says that we have  packets of the films along with the camera i only got  boxes and one half of an opened film box the whole reason why i payed  was because i was under the impression that i was going to get the  box of films i am so disappointed about my purchase i couldnt be just bought the camera and films separately for a cheaper price i feel cheatedincomplete package

17305,2,"i bought this product about a year ago and was excited at first it is excellent to saute veggies and meats as an initial step it would be lovely if i could just continue to make one pot meal and switch to slowcooking during the process unfortunately it is not possible with my pot when i am making for example chili the entire concoction never gets hot enough during the next  hours as it is preset everything indicates that the pot only stays warm the entire time i also tried to cook the meal for the entire following  hours and kept changing the settings a number of times but the positive result was never achieved each time using the dutch oven i had to move my meal to the classic ceramic slow cooker just to complete my cookingi rated  stars in this review and not  because it seems to be a good product overall i am as disappointed as i was in other all in one kitchen products before from my experience if the manufacturers offer too many functions most likely something will go wrong with certain pieces i wish that i could still replace but understand it is too late again the saute function is a very good feature because it is quick and effectiveslow cooking function  disappointing"
3266,2,we bought this lens at the end of july to use with our nikon  we took a lot of photos during august and it did a great job didnt use it at all from september through november then got it out again for a vacation beginning december  by december  it had ceased to work with the camera autofocus and the lens was getting stuck part way out with only a  day warranty we will now have to see if we can get it repaired somewhere on our own very disappointingwas great while it worked
6901,1,i had some trouble with the lighting of the developed pictures but still loved it nonethelessafter less than a month of infrequent use my camera stopped working at first it wasnt turning on after attempting to turn it on and off for several minutes i finally got it on and tried to take a picture in the little window that shows the number of pictures left in the film pack there was no number listed and just a  instead when i tried to take a photo it would come out just blacki immediately contacted amazon and the product support team the amazon rep wasnt able to help me so he connected me in a  call with a technical support rep from fujifilmthe fujifilm rep had me perform a few troubleshooting tests  which ruined two packs of film he assured me that i would be mailed complimentary replacement packs he instructed me to download and print the repair form from the fujifilm website and mail my camera without batteries to the listed address on the formhe did not tell me how long it would take fujifilm would not cover the costs of the shipment so i had to pay  out of my pocket to send the camera to their location in edison njhave been quite frustrated in my communication efforts with the fujifilm teamthe camera was delivered within a few daysi gave it about a week and then called for an update to ensure the camera was received since i received no communication otherwise i was rather rudely told that it takes two weeks i confirmed that i would call back the following wednesday two weeks after delivery if i heard nothing by thenthe following wednesday i gave a call and was then told it was two weeks not counting weekends i was told i would for sure receive an email by the end of the week or beginning of the nextwhen i didnt hear back i called again at that point the camera had been delivered for  business daysthe man on the repair team said they were backed up but not that backed up and that they should absolutely have been working in my camera by then he tried to look up my case by my name but said it wasnt even in the system he told me he would reach out to the other teamwarehouse to confirm where my camera was and that he would call me back and took down my phone numberi didnt hear back so i followed up again a few days later and called the repair team i was told that it would take two weeks and reexplained my situation he told me he didnt know who i talked to but there wasnt anything he could do if i wasnt in the system and transferred me to his manager the manager did not answer so i left a voicemail i have contacted the manager twice nowall in all i got about a months use out of a camera then was told to send it to an external team and had to pay money to send it and wasted two packs of film and now have wasted about another month of my time since i mailed the camera out in the first placei am now out  the cost of the camera itself and two packs of film with no resolution in sight i wish amazon had just agreed to take care of this and rectified the situationfaulty item  even worse service on fujifilms end
10017,5,i like rice but dont eat that much because i need to watch my carb intake but in chemo now and need easy to swallow foods and rice is very versatile i bought a bag of walmart rice to practice with when the cooker arrived the first batch was perfect with respect to texture and moisture it would be perfect for chop sticks because it held together i put butter salt and pepper and it was terrific i ate the whole thing i had ordered some asain rice and these are even better looking forward to trying recipes for congeejoin by the time chemo is done i probably wont ever eat rice again but it is really a comfort food right nowgreat rice cooker

17296,4,ive never owned a rice cooker before or an instant pot but note this is not a pressure cooker it is a rice cooker i wanted a rice cooker i cooked rice and was happy with how it turned out the books with the machine include a chart showing how much white rice brown rice oatmeal quinoa to water to put in the pot with rice and quinoa you put in the grain and water and push the corresponding button very easy but there it ends the book says that for oatmeal you need to set the time manually but doesnt say for how long the book says oatmeal takes  minutes to cook that a big range the cooker also comes with a steaming basket somewhere in the materials it says you can steam veggies and fish yay again for how long can i steam it with rice or only with the steam button which requires you to set time manually can i steam chicken should the veggies be frozen or defrosted or fresh the booklet says we have partnered with chefs authors and bloggers to compile a collection of recipes that we hope you enjoy i can find any instant pot zest rice cooker recipes online in short the machine seems fine but not user friendly for a first time rice cooker owner who would like to use all the advertised features other than cooking riceno recipe book or instructions

14371,5," its a very energy efficient rice cooker with delicious resultsi measured the power consumption fluctuates between  to  watts depending on its heating patternthe top can be removed for easy cleaning and theres a handle for carrying around although i cant imagine doing that oftenit appears to have a builtin battery to support the clock on display even after the power cord is unpluggedthe power cord is located on the side which allows me to put it close against the wall where space is limitedthe white rice setting takes  minutes a bit longer that i would like but the rice does taste better than my previous faster cookeryummy rice"

15698,5,love the rice cooker its just the right size the buttons do glow so you can see if its cooking or on warm now the only thing is is that i had to turn the overhead light off to see the blue light because its not bright and i wasnt sure if it was working maybe that should have been red all of the items came with it the plastic spoon a measuring cup directions and a little book showing itemseasy to use

4742,1,recieved it took  picture and never worked againnever worked
7244,2,hero cameras seem to have a known problem that is very rarely talked about until you actually get your hands on one of thesethe problem is that you can find the camera in the sort of state where its not damaged the battery is fully charged but for some reason it will not turn onyou can search youtube and gopros website for a solution which involves a hard reset aka take the battery and sd card out and try  that does not solve the issue and you move to more and more ridiculous ways to make it come to lifei had made a purchase and mine arrived with this issue and i was not able to resolve it returnedas a very inexpensive and great alternative check out  lightdow   hd sports action camera bundle with  chip  lpstft lcd  wide angle lens and bonus battery bluedisappointing but most people swear by these things

6363,2,i ordered two of these cameras for a video shoot i needed cameras that could be lost or damaged without running over budget the quality didnt need to be great just okay i figured since these cameras claimed  that they couldnt be that bad so i tried themlets start with the goodthey have an lcd screen so you can see what your shootingthe menu and camera settings are easy to navigate and the camera is overall easy to usecomes with several accessories that seem to be of decent qualitynow the badthe camera quality is terrible we are talking the kind of quality you would expect from a  home camcorder forget about the claimed  or  resolutions it might record in some weird variant of that resolution but that is not the capture resolution at all the capture resolution what you actually get not what is recorded appears to be closer to  this isnt an exaggeration my old sony   camera looks much sharper when scaled up to  then this thing does it should also be noted that the aspect ratio you are dealing with on this camera is around  so if you scale to fit  you end up cropping the image giving you closer to  resolution no that is not a typo i meant  not  the poor resolution the colors are a disaster besides not even being close to capturing what the colors really are the colors that do get captured are complete mush any edges at all have horrible color fringing making the edges of everything look like dancing rainbowsnow maybe the absolutely horrible completely unusable quality is something you can live with you just need a camera with a wide field of view well you are going to be disappointed here as well despite the claims that this camera features a  fov it definitely doesnt at least not in video mode i didnt test the photo mode the actual field of view seems closer to  degreesconclusionthis camera might make an okay toy for a child outside of that i cant image how it could possibly be useful to anyone with its truly horrible picture qualityatrocious video quality completely unusable
7030,1,absolutely horrible anyone who says this is a great product for professionals has no idea what theyre talking about and is obviously a novice at best the brushes and microfiber clothes are laced with more dust than my grams  and the cleaning solution leaves a nasty residue thank god i didnt attempt to clean my sensor i just tore down my  lens to clean the internals only to find that everything in this kit made it worse i should make you buy me a new lensdo not waste your time with this crap

6987,1,unless you are wanting washedout and grainy photos for nostalgia of the polaroid days dont buy this camera use your phone to take great images and print them on the canon selphy printer the printer is about the same size as this camera but delivers  x  prints in a similar amount of time the quality of the prints will blow you away and the apps work perfectly with my samsung phone letting you make prints of several different sized below  poor prints
285,1,i know it was going to be used  but i didnt know you guys would send me the wrong battery  a charger that doesnt light up when you plug it in  i need this camera working by this weekend for event  i basically was played by you guys  i have the wrong battery  doesnt fit in charger   the charger wont even lit up when plugged in alonevery upset
1987,2,i was so excited to have a polaroid again but for what i paid for it it is poor quality all photos have lines across them and are either crazy dark or almost white i know old school polaroids werent known for fantastic photos but they were a lot better than this sent back  days ago waiting for refundcool but not worth the money
8919,1,terrible camera difficult to use poor picture quality the flash is useless forget about taking pictures indoors unless you turn on every light in the house very slow processing of picture do not even think about taking pictures in a quick manner just stay away i missed my return window by one day so i am stuck with it do not make the mistaketerrible
4689,1,the reader does not work for transferring or even viewing pictures on a sd card when you plug device in phone it automatically ejects and damaged filesi bought it to carry on my key ring for checking game cameras with my phone i have lost thousands of pictures by trying to use thisdo not buy
10138,5,love it been wanting a rice cooker for a while now and glad i got it really like it and works greatamazing product
7401,1,i was very excited for this instax camera that had the more traditional square photos and the camera itself was more asthetically pleasing however after using it a couple times in different settings ive found its not on par with other insta cameras which i have used for years all the photos are extremely dark even in well lit areas its also not easy to position this camera for photos unfortunately i bought this ahead of time for an event i was hoping the tester pictures i took were a fluke they were not and its now too late to return waste of moneyhey something else
5667,1,i turned it on and it immediately turned back offwont even be turned on
6429,2,i put the camera on my chest and put it on record and after maybe two hours i looked at it and realized the battery indicator was down to one bar and from my understanding it supposed to last longer than that but what the review on it sayspoor battery life
8398,1,the second time i used sticker photo paper it stopped working nothing alignedi used the app and their builtin sticker frame for itit does not align how to fix
10545,5,this was an absolute great buy it cooks the rice perfect just right for my family size of twoperfect
15456,5,i just turned into a chef without much effort all you need is a recipe and the ingredients set and forget the pressure cooker does the rest cooks perfectly all of the time no more slaving over a hot stove and you cannot accidentally burn your food the cost is reasonable and the controls are intuitive i would recommend this product for any onegreat pressure cooker
20,5,charging ones phone could not be easier i have and older iphone se and it works greati thought id use this at my beside table to charge overnight but wound up placing one on my desk and one in a handy area in our kitchen i dont lose my phone as the charger stays in one place a place for everything and everything in its placeat my desk i dont have to fiddle with a fragile cord while i ignore repeated phone callsill probably get a few more as they are very handy and dont get tangled like the dozen or so cords fighting for real estate on my deskcordless chargers do create some heat on the charger and the phone as well a bit of research and i learned that the heat is normal and not detrimental to the device or the phone i just wasnt prepared for that and it did alarm me until i learned its okayyes  id recommend this device easy use quick chargeeasy to use plug and play charger
7487,2,camera is tiny unless you got small fingers this would not work for regular size men has lots of parts for helmets and such i think you get more of the equipment than the camera stick to something bigger if you are going to be touching the screen a lotgood for the value
1104,2,camera is great but there were old pictures of someone on it so it was definitely used alreadywas already used
2549,1,my daughter loved this camera but now it stopped printing it just spits out paperink stopped working

5926,2,bad quality pictures are horriblebad quality  dont understand the point  its like a cheap toddler toy with a kodak logo
10062,5,"i am amazed i finally gave up trying to cook rice properly babysitting the pot but still overcooking or undercooking it most of the time  or i used too much or too little water i decided to try a rice cooker this one had one of the top ratings and some really encouraging video reviews of people saying how they used it happily for yearsi followed the instructions basically  the rice  the rice important  water to the line  the button and in about  minutes i had perfectly cooked white rice yes it worked even the first time then the next day i tried it with brown rice same instructions but push a different button again perfectly cooked  this time after about  houri have since used it a few more times with varying quantities of rice and am still amazingly pleased with how perfect it is i even used the automatic keepwarm feature to keep the rice warm and moist for over  hours it cleans up very easilynote  the review i had seen showed that their lid was a little hard to clean because it had a steam port the company must have since improved the design because mine has an easytoclean smooth removable liner in the lid so both the cooking pot and the lid can be removed to clean easilyhighly recommendedincredibly foolproof easy and perfect"
5860,1,didnt connect to wifi like we expected shuts off during recordingshuts off while recording

702,1,we bought this camera for vacation terrible investment the camera is very cheap the pictures on buttons wore off the first time we used the camera the camera is difficult to take pictures with you have to hold the button for an awkwardly long time before the photo takes picture quality is absolute trash would never buy again wanted to return but missed my return window  do not recommend if you want photos youre able to use for anything later onterrible photo quality
2245,1,this camera was a gift for someone cool easy tk use camera but cheap quality also is came broken only works when plugged in the charger unfortunatecheap
6875,1,was so trashy and felt like a toyi would not buy
4078,2,i love gadgets and i wanted to love this i pretty sure that it might be great for some people depending what they need this for but i will list pros and cons about it and you decide if it is what you are looking forpros great image quality wireless easy to setup great night vision when there is no glass in between the camera and the point of interest sends motion detection alertscons it records only from  to  seconds  unless you pay for a subscription if you have too much action and setup for recording the battery does not last much so if you mounted it on the ceiling you will have the hassle to very often climb a ladder to change its batteries which are not cheap lets say you are traveling for a couple of weeks you will not be happy to know that your expensive device let you down if you set up in a tree like netgear show in their video the change of batteries is not going to be that easy there is a delay in the image the app will stop working if you change apps on your phone  so when you click on it again you will need to make some clicks before you see the image again the image freezes up when you change the recording time so you have to quit the app you need a paid subscritpion to be able do record  for  days only btw and you will be replacing the batteries  so i do not believe that it will actually record  days in a rollit does not have sound which i knew but i missed this feature the night vision does not work in front a window in other word you cannot turn off the infra red like in other cheap camerassumming all up i dont think this product is ready for the public  it is a very nice camera but not really usefull this camera cannot be trusted as a secuity device because of its many flaws iif you are looking for a security camera i do not recommend cause either you return it or eventually you will end up with another paper weight now if you want to amuse yourself looking at the nature or eventually looking what is going on in your living room  it is not too badbad bad bad too many flaws  not reliable
4688,2,said it was for my phone it didnt work on it wrong sizewould not refund full amount and still left with something i cant usewould not buy from again
13066,5,you can steam vegetables shrimp etc it has a cookbook to give you idealsnot just for rice
10238,5,"this pot was great for the  days it worked wont turn on nothinggetting in touch with customer service had been a challenge as theyre closed every time i callno box to return lets see what happensunbelievably disappointededit customer service came through and i was sent another one no issuesstopped working after  days"
10929,4,love the size  doesnt hog counter space love the steam basket for veggies fish or reheating other meat while rice is cooking i have found that i need to add a bit more water than is recommended but that may just be my preference a full pot serves  people this would make a great giftuse this nearly every day
3367,1,this is a terrible camera the picture is very poor quality we returned it right away we did not have any challenges with the return processpoor quality pictures
6826,1,there is no polaroid symbol in this camera this is a fake productfake camera
4522,2,i wanted to love this camera but when i used it the video switched by itself form awesome light to darkness that cannot be fixed in any editing software and when reaching out to  support they gave a very generic response that didnt help at all it is a great idea but its better to wait for a better release i shipped it backwanted to love it
4435,1,i spent  years in the computer industry by far this is the worst product i have ever seen i have spent  hours trying to load a single picture on this device i cant figure it out i have been a computer programmer  years experience business manager  years of computer products companies there is no phone number available to contact these losers from reading the documentation you cant copy pictures directly from your computer to the picture frame you can email pictures not very efficient there may be a way to set up folders on the picture frame although i cant find any documentation that describes it i emailed a picture to the xxxxxxmypixstarcom it says my picture frame is online the picture never arrived i give up this was going to be a valentines day present now its going back how they got good reviews is a mystery to methe product is terrible
14394,5,the price is surprisingly cheap and the same as the rice cooker i used in japanbest price
7563,1,dont know why always showits no powercant use it anymore
872,1,picture shows  extra film packs i only received  only came with  extra films
12445,4,i liked the design of this rice cooker very muchexcelent cooking if cooked with the instructions given  i also cooked momos and it was preety goodi dont have much complaintsreliable fool proof rice cooker i liked
5034,1,bought this product as a gift for my granddaughter order the  the receipt said  but the product that i received was the earlier version  given that it was a christmas present i had no time to return and replace this itemmistaken product substitution
14849,5,was looking for a rice cooker and bought this because the description mentioned you could make soups and stews with it too so i wanted to try it i have made a soup and rice separately this elite gourmet works really great its easy to use love the versatility and really easy to clean i would recommendversatile cooker
11435,5,its perfect for just me and my husband yes its very tiny but like i said perfect for  grown people and super super cutelove it
16049,5,the quantity is good for  person just right for megood for  person
7443,1,wanted a camera to carry on vacation instead of my phone so i wasnt looking for anything great i was ok with the idea of plastic and liked the color it didnt charge up thoughand the app it wanted you to use for the wifi had no reviews on line so i wasnt reassured sending it back and will keep lookingwanted cheap but this wasnt good enough
1034,2,the shutter speed is very slow and the picture quality is grainy it works for my  yr old any older and id say she is barely okay with itnot as good as expected
3220,1,this camera will not zoom in and focus at the same time i finally quit using it altogether because it would not even zoom in when i needed it to or if it did it would not focus big waste of moneydisappointed
8328,2,my daughter received this as a gift from my mom at christmas and it was quickly one of her favorite things i was amazed at how she quickly figured it out on her own and loved seeing her photos however last month less than a month since getting it it continually shuts down with low battery message even though it was just fully charged as of this review its unusable because of thisshe loved it but battery is dead
14835,5,i consider myself a very good cook but could never get simple white rice to turn out edible i had been contemplating getting a rice cooker for years but did not want one more gadget or gizmo that i never use kicking around and taking up more space yeah you air fryer i finally did one day and wish i had done it sooner perfect rice every time been using it for about  months now i follow the instructions on the rice package and always make the same amount which is perfect for  people with some leftover so  generous servings a measuring cup comes with it but it is not a standard sized cup it is smaller my measurements are standard i use  cup white rice rinsed  cups chicken broth two teaspoons of butter and seasonings usually salt pepper garlic powder and onion powder i plug it in just before i cook it because it is automatically on the warm setting once plugged in there is no off button then press the button down to start the cooking process it takes  minutes for the button to pop up and leave it on the warm setting for  more minutes fluff the cooked rice takes up a little less than half of the bowl when its done i dont think  cups of cooked rice would actually fit in it though double the amount i usually make would comfortably fit it does bubble while cooking so you need some extra room on top and it splatters out the vent hole in the lid a little also some rice on the bottom turns golden and sticks a little but i think it tastes delicious it adds nice flavor and texture to the rice the rice spatula that comes with the cooker works perfectly for this i have rubbed the bowl with butter to see if it helped with sticking but it really didnt make enough difference to bother with the extra step the bowl is not really difficult to clean because of this either i have yet to venture out and try adding other things to the rice i always make the rest of the meal separate but i have seen quite a few other recipes you can make in this too with veggies and stuff that look good to try i would highly recommend getting one if youre thinking about it this particular model was very affordable simple to use easy to clean up and works great so far for what i have used it forlove it
6990,1,i bought this for a work trip in africa it broke after only two rolls of film and then i had to carry it and all the film i had bought for it around africa for  months it just says error everytime i try to switch it oni basically never write reviews but this was a disappointing experience and i imagine this camera breaks all the time since it is cheaply madebroke after  rolls of film
833,2,if you drop it dont botherits ok
17194,5,"this is a review of the instant pot  cup zest plus amazon needs to do a better job in filtering the reviews based on the item chosenwe primarily eat indian vegetarian cuisine at home and already have a instant pot pressure cookerif you already have an instant pot then i think there is no need for this rice cooker at all but if you do not have the pressure cooker this one would be a good item to purchase the saute option is helpful when you want to make fried rice or some south indian riceor barley based delicacy the taste of your item depends on the quantity of water that needs to be added and that would vary by person to person i primarily eat a south indian rice called mattarosematta rice and i cook it using the manual mode and it comes out great so it is a matter of trial and error when it comes to items that are not in the default buttons the default buttons do work very well as well barley came out fantastic again the water to grain ratio is not fixed in stonethis rice cooker also comes with a steamer option a perforated pan is included i have not used the steamer yet so i cant say anything about itcleaning is very easy since the container has a non stick coating for sauteing i use a wooden spatula so i dont destroy the coating i still am not sure about cleaning the lid it does seem as if the lid just needs to be wiped clean and there is nothing else that has to be donethis is a fantastic addition zest plus"
1426,1,buy this camera if you are a  pound weakling and you need a bulkier look not my problem so it made me look like a bowling ball handily they have branded it camera so you will not be confused as to its use im sure it must be a coincidence that they used the same font as canon it aint no canon cameratakes wide angle to a new level
6500,2,the pictured panel is not what was delivered to me the one in the picture had an led read out this one does not works okay but not greatunit pictured was not what i recieved
5696,1,i would leave less than one star if i could this is the first time ive tried putting this paper in my camera beyond what came with it and it does not work with the camera do not buy this paper for your camera this is so maddening i was so excited to buy this camera because it was exactly what i needed for my journaling the paper is supposed to be sticky paper too which is another reason why i went with this camera but this paper does not have a sticky back i used the first  sheets that came with the camera and had no trouble at all but now with this first pack of paper nothing will printi went back to my order to see if i could request a refund and its not even an option what a nice way for them to make money off me for nothing if polaroid reads my review and makes an attempt to fix this then i will come back and edit the review but until then im extremely passed this was an expensive purchase for me that is now essentially useless edit i did track down the seller as suggested warehouse deals inc keep your eyes peeled it didnt give me an option to go back and leave anything for themnot original zink paper and not sticky paper
7643,2,there was no case as described in the item description camera is cute and fun but there is no case to protect it you can get an item cheaper form somewhere elseno case is provided with this order

3555,2,i have no instructions for this product but a limited one page on the setup trying to use the camera will be a mystery i am now reviewing videos on youtube however most are on the setup and rarely speak of the functionscannot get the camera to come on and there was no instructions
5094,1,terrible qualitydo not buy product
3521,2,i wanted to love this camera however im unable to there are a couple of things that i would say i dislike and a few things that i liked so lets start with my  low light quality is horrible it looks pretty bad which is to be expected from such a small sensor i guess but i was hoping it had gotten better if youre mostly going to shoot during the daytime or with good lighting then youll get some very nice video but at night this thing is just very  design not so much the camera itself but the accessories mostly talking about the media mod youll most probably end up wanting to get for this camera its cool that you can close the little mounting legs on the camera to create a flush bottom so that you can easily insert it into the media mod it is not cool that you have to then unfold the little mounting legs from the camera in order to mount the media modinstead of having its own legs the media mod has a whole so that you can us the legs from the camera itself which means that if your battery runs out and you need to replace it you have to unhook the whole thing from whatever mount you had it on then you have to close the cameras mount legs slide the camera out change whatever it is you need to change slide the camera back in open the legs again and mount it backi mean its not difficult but it is annoying especially when it would have been so simple to just give the media mod its own mounting legs i put this as part of the review for the camera because the media mod is something a lot of people will eventually want and they should know this ahead of  in the short time that i used it the camera froze up on me while recording twice ill be recording something and then i click the button to stop and it wont stop there is absolutely no way to force it to restart either other than pulling out the battery so once again if you have the media mod on you have to undo the mount close the legs pull out the camera take out the battery and so onwhenever you take out a battery from a camera thats recording there is a very good chance that youll ruin the file you were recordingthis for me is the reason why im really thinking of returning this camera the other issues i can deal with but this makes me not trust  battery life is pretty weak it may be great compared to other gopros but i was not  maybe there is a setting somewhere that i missed but i hate that in order to power it off i had to press and old the power button simply pressing it would switch me to the next mode not a big deal i just kept forgetting and switching modes when i really wanted to turn it offthings i likethere is a lot to like about this  video quality is great when you have good  video stabilization is absolutely amazing on this  i love the fact that i can press the record button when the camera is off and itll start up and be recording right away press the button again and itll stop recording and power itself  i like the little front screen and the fact that i can have the back screen turned off quickly so that im not wasting that much battery while  i love the idea of the media mod although i strongly believe they messed up on the mountoverall great camera if i could trust it my real issue with it is my issue number  cant trust iti just cant trust it to do its job
1883,2,allamazing for you and others
12337,5,this is our second rice maker we had a smaller one before wanted to get a bigger its very reasonably priced good size and works greatgood size and price works great
4296,2,i purchased this backpack for when i go hiking or walking a lot and want to sling my camera on my back for easy transport and out of the way however i find when using it because the bag zips around the side the camera falls out or my lens drops to the ground easily ive only used it twice and i lost the lens cap and the second time the camera and lens fell completely out of the pack because of the way the camera and lenses lay in the side and the zipper wraps around im not going to be using it in the future unfortunately when im in a hurry to take a picture i cant risk damaging my equipment or losing something i need something with more quick access that safely holds the equipment i wouldnt recommend want to sling my camera on my back for easy transport and out of the way
14731,4,"the instructions are a bit difficult to understand but once you realize the included measuring cup is  cup and the measurements inside the unit for water are measured in cups it becomes easier to understand it uses a  water to rice ratio simpleto use it add in the rice  cup per person works with my family pour in the water select the rice type using the menu button glutonous is short white rice and mixed is long grain rice then press cook it takes about  mins for  cups of rice for  peoplefast no simple debatable perfect rice every time yes it comes out a bit sticky but plump and tasty i have not tried the other options as i only plan to use it for riceits easy to clean as well but be sure use the soft side of a sponge or a soft clothnote the coating of the interior of the bowl is very thin even a tiny scratch will cause it to peel away after a few uses rendering it unusable we had to throw it out once that happened exercise caution when cleaning and do not put anything metal inside it even when it is in the sink to soak as it can easily damaging itgreat rice every time but instructions are confusing"
2468,1,the picture and video quality is far from  or  megapixels it has no autofocus it was definitely not properly advertised my phone has better camera than this device im processing the return of this camerajust a bad cameradont buy
1210,1,this required a formated sd card it came with a unformated card which i was supposed to be able to format on camera i could not format it on the camera  the instructions indicated if i could not format the card provided i should purchase another alas that too did not work apparently the camera was defective i would not purchase again or recommend it based on my experiencethis required a formated sd card
17431,5,"after  years replacing my first rice cooker from zojirushi needed to be replaced not because it was not functional but due to many moves has taken its toll ive been wanting to purchase this upgraded cooker for some time and finally decided to do itno regrets despite its jump in price but in my opinion well worth it it cooks flawlessly once you master the right water level and settings  which did not take longi used to be a white sticky rice only person but now prepared mixed rice dishes and gaba brown never thought i would ever cook a diversity of rice meals as the cooking bowl is very substantial in weight resulting in consistent results the menu options are easy to use with different settings for the type of rice dishes you are preparingi highly recommendgreat update from our basic rice cooker"

17709,5,"i have had a cuckoo for  years which i bought and used in korea and europe it never failed was consistent in producing good rice and was dirt cheap i think i got it for like  roughly  it was basic and small with a  capacity we are a  person household so more than that is overkill it was a reliable rice cooker and i loved itnow that i moved to the us i needed a rice cooker that was  i was leaning towards japanese rice cookers because they are a  country the problem with browsing rice cookers on amazon is the results mostly lean towards the bigger size small ones are generally regular manual rice cookers its also quite hard to judge the reviews because most americans dont have rice cookers so any rice produced with rice cookers would be heavenly for them thus having a best rice ever headline i had to sift through reviews and find ones made by people who have had ricer cookers prior to this purchasei decided on this rice cooker because it looked sleek and has a lot of cooking options and at the same time it was the perfect size for my counter and had the correct capacity it is also similar to my cuckoo one except for  more settings it produces the same quality rice but this takes way longerfor  cup uncooked rice this rice cooker needs  to produce normal white fluffy rice whereas my cuckoo could do it in  i dont know if this is due to voltage difference or just manufacturer preference since i havent tried the  of my old cuckoo which amazon sells this rice cooker does have a quick option which allows a user to have rice in around  but not as soft as the  option this is understandable because slow cooking rice will always be better this is not the best rice ever in my opinion but both my cuckoo and this zojirushi produced comparable rice quality good enough for daily meals and way better than manually boiling rice on a potit does not burn the bottom rice it keeps rice warm and moist there is no congee option but i find that the oatmeal function works well but you have to experiment with water ratio tip after soaking for an hour or so crush the uncooked rice with your hands then use that in the rice cooker it is very easy to cleanthis brand is quite popular in japan and i now understand why this is the most basic model but it still produces good rice i have yet to try their fancier models with pressure options for faster cooking for now this model works wonderfully fits my familys needs and is priced appropriatelyslow but produces good quality rice dependable and perfect for small households"
3380,1,very cheaply madecheap
6821,2,got this for my  yo grand daughter for her birthday today she was hoping to use it at her birthday party that was a big disappointment as there is no internal memory and without memory it cannot save pictures so i went out to buy a micro sd card so it could work the instructions said the camera could deal with level  cards  higher  up to  so i bought a fast  card locally but after numerous attempts the polaroid  would not recognize the sd card we tried the usdcard in another camera  it worked fine instead of joy my grand daughter was disappointed now i have to ship it back to amazonpolaroid  camera beware there is no internal memory or batteries included
15362,5,i love love mine i cook everything in it made the best fried potatoes ever highly recommendexcellent product
8519,1,after going through  costly cartridges the camera doesnt seem to want to give me my pictures the film keeps getting jammed and when i opened the back to take the full cartridge out the film is sticking out of the cartridge by half a cm the camera is pushing the film out but not enough so i can access it without opening the back the little silver metal piece inside that pushes out each film after a shot works i have tried taking a picture with the back open and cartridge out and have seen the piece move up and down i spent over a hundred dollars instead of  for this model because i wanted the quality i shouldve bought the cheaper version if i knew this camera would malfunction i am really disappointedif you want a camera that just wastes all your costly film
6023,1,dont buy only worked for  daybad camera

3761,2,there is no way this tiny camera can be waterproof as advertised there was no sd card that was not mentioned in the ad it is flimsy and cheaply made just hoping it holds up through the kiddos birthdayonly thing good was the price
7278,1,the wifi connection didnt work as previous owners passcode was o it so cant use that and quality of footage is very poor as the oi eps are all distorted in a lot of frames turing on and off the camera was a hassle as it would turn off and on on its own accord therefore draining no the battery so when i actually wanted it on it would have very little battery left  overall very disappointed and not worth the noneydont buy

9014,1,just after  days the camera refused to hold a charge i paid almost  to ship back to panasonic after a little more than a week the camera was returned and seemed to work i used it a few times since and now it is not taking a charge again not at all pleased with the process or the stability of the camera deeply regret this purchase via amazon should have gone through best buy where they would have swapped it out for a replacement on the spotdone with panasonic
4708,1,it doesnt work with my  too warmth is it will overheat and destroy your phone while you figure out how it workswarning could make your phone explode
2045,2,i was hoping that the photos would be good but the exposure is fuzzy at best for all photos ive taken and the colors are completely off ill be returning this itemfocus and exposure are awful
6533,1,connector piece shattered cheap plasticconnector broke
12991,5,i really like this rice cooker i like that it also has a steamer basket so i can steam my vegetables as well easy to use and measure out my rice and cooking liquids makes enough for my big family i like that i can remove the pot and the strainer for easy cleaning with so many other functions like warmer slow cook and quick rice this multitasker really helps out with family mealsnice for multitasking
5572,2,super disappointed with this camera the battery cover was missing from the the package so i have had to put tape over the batteries to keep them in the camera also likes to lag a ton you take a picture wait and then have to click the button again to get it to actually workmeh at best
1453,2,this camera is subpar at best  autozoom does not work  not easy to toggle thru photos takenyou get what you pay for
17594,5,"prossmallportableretractable cordlightweightmultimenueasy to operateconsnot cheapinternal batterywhat i received in the package x zojirushi  micom rice cooker x internal  cup cooking bowl x plastic spatula x plastic spatula holder accessory x plastic measuring cup x user manualthis zojirushi  micom rice cooker product is an easy to use small rice cooker  warmer is approximately   x   x   and weighs in at roughly  interface is straightforward you simply depress the  button until you reach the type of rice you are cooking and then select  there are other functions but that is the very basics it will play a little tune before it gets started the timer will count down until it is readythis is a small rice cooker for the price but it does seem to cook a perfect pot of rice each timethere are a few features that i think are outstanding with this cooker first the  power cord is fully retractable making cleanup and storage easy you should be careful not to pull the cord out passed the red sticker or it may not reel back in second the cooker produces very little condensation that you have to clean up it was easy to wipe down and store all residual condensation drains directly into the pot so not extra parts to clean third the cooker is compact and relatively lightweight the pot has a  cup capacity which is small for the price but quite sufficientill be honest here i have never paid this much for a rice cooker i have gone through phases of using a cooker and then making rice manually in a pot i decided recently to breakdown and get another cooker i did a lot of research on models and brands and this one came out on topthis micom model uses fuzzy logic to makes micro changes to your cooking time etc depending in various variables to ensure your rice is cooked to perfection each time i am hawaiian and we are heavy rice eaters rice has been a staple on our table since i can remember i cook rice practically daily depending on my needs i have yet to be disappointed with this cooker you just start it and leave it  much like any other rice cooker the difference is the rice is perfectit does have a delayed cooking feature if you want to prep it and cook it later to do this you select the cooking program from the menu and then you select the time you want the rice to be completely cooked and ready the micom will process the information and determine when it needs to start to complete it at that time nice i have tried cooking the following rice typeswhitebrownbasmatijasminesaffronwhile the unit does not have a specific basmati saffron or jasmine rice preset i found that using the long grain or white setting with the proper rice to water ratio works just finenow to the only feature i dont care for this cooker has an internal clock which runs off of a clock battery that is integrated into the circuit board the only instructions are when the battery goes out to contact the manufacturer for a replacement which is not free i am pretty handy and figure that when the time comes i will add a battery slot so you can replace the battery in the future without having to solder again but that is a consideration you do have to mull over if you are looking at this model as to replace this battery it will be something that the manufacturer will have to do if you dont want to void your warranty or damage the unit if you are not skilled in soldering granted these batteries typically last roughly  years so it should easily outlast your  warranty i feel this a money grab for a unit that is already quite expensive i considered dropping it a star for making it a requirement to have to have the replaced by the manufacturer the reason i didnt is that it will still operate if you plug it in  it just will not retain the clock time and you will have to rest the time each time you plug it in if you unplug it i can live with thati am also not a huge fan of nonstick surfaces however that is common among all rice cooker brands the unit also has a part the power cord that contain bpa while it is not in direct contact with any cooking surface or food the possibility does exist that you could crosscontaminate the cooking pot or food by plugging in the cord and not washing your hands before you begin to prepare the rice keep that in mind the manufacturer offers a  warranty from the original purchase date on this producti appreciate you taking the time to read this all in all i have had a number of rice cookers in my lifetime  i wish i had known about this brand years ago please dont let the price tag fool you it is worth every penney so far and will pay for itself inside a year with the amount of rice my family consumes as well as the time savings while this is an excellent unit  there is still room for improvement here that would make it a true  appliance it is so close to being  to me and is probably the best cooker i have ever owned however for those who dont prefer nonstick the ability to purchase a ceramic pot would be a great option removing all bpas from the product would be another and the ability to change out the battery is something that should be to be done without having to send in the unit as the world continues to trend toward more healthy and sustainable choices  i hope this is something this manufacturer takes to heart it must also be noted that all brands i have owned or researched suffer from the same flaws hope this information was helpful this product is made in chinaamazing cooker with just a few flaws"

15591,5,"this rice cooker is small in size and perfect for singledouble use in apartment or school dormitory the power required is  only so wont cause much power current shortage issue even for old buildingthe inner pot is very light weighted and easy to clean while the lid is transparent for ease of observation if required however there is no off button so power cord has to be pulled out if not in use otherwise this cooker will stay in the keep warm modecompact rice cooker and steamer"
14790,5,easy to use easy to clean cooks large quantities of rice very happy with my cuckoo rice cookerperfect rive every time
15748,5,i love this rice maker its just the right size for my family and it makes the best rice restaurant quality i know it also takes following good instructions also but it comes with clear instructions also shows you a picture is how to make your rice for sushi and more on the side of the rice makerperfect
16687,5,"i think like most people i assumed any rice cooker is just as good as the next dear god was i wrong we had the old throw down oster rice cooker that weve had for years i think we paid  for it at wally world back when my wife and i first got together and we made plenty of rice in it over the yearsfinally much to our chagrin it died it was a peaceful death and we had a beautiful celebration of life ceremony for it right before we threw it in the trash can thats when i went on the hunt for a new one i knew i wanted a slightly larger cooker since we had felt like we couldnt make enough rice for dinner parties that was basically my only requirement when i started lookingi had no idea that there were so many rice cookers out in the world nor did i know you could pay in excess of  for one who knewi found out rather quickly that cuckoo was a very widely used and respected brand and slapped down about  for this one doing a little better than i was  years ago i figured why notand thats when i realized that i had been eating terrible rice made by a cheap rice cooker all these years the first time i made rice in this cooker i couldnt believe how much better it was this thing consistently churns out the best tasting rice ive ever had i legitimately eat rice at least three times a week now and i cant believe i went this long eating the gruel that my old cheap cooker was producingits got more options than youre likely to ever use but it has  different settings for white rice savory is my favorite even though i takes the longest there is also a quick rice setting which cooks in a comparable amount of time as my old one but still makes better ricei would highly recommend this machine if youre in the market for one as i said buy a better rice cooker and youll get better ricebetter rice cooker  better rice"
8412,1,the pictures print with a warm tintthe color is off
4353,1,i dont need to bother with proofit takes the most mediocure pictues ive seen any camera do except for  walmart phonesmy  phone from walmarts way better hahaim pissed cause they also wont give me a refund which is probably my fault for not double checking but that seems like a new issue to me because ive done it beforeeven with a damn giant kiddie poolhorrible
4740,1,the camera froze and wont work within minutes of use i have a very sad childtrash
3025,1,so disappointed ordered this for my daughter put everything together and it wont work returning ithorrible
1721,2,item returned bought a minolta pro shotbattery lasts only   hours not for me
6033,2,so we bought one of these for one of my sons he enjoyed it so we bought a second one for a different child the first camera was great and still works the second one had an issue with the waterproof container and leaked i reached out to them and the product was replaced immediatelythis one worked for like  days and now has a pink screen and doesnt work or take pictures you can view pictures but cant take anything highly disappointed in the product its easy to use has a few games like tetris but to have a new camera sent to you and now it doesnt work after a few days poor quality wont buy againdissappointed
5878,2,it came in good condition so i thought i found a photo in the camera on what looked like a factor and a bunch of these devices were stacked up idk if they were fixing them or just testing as it is just a photo the quality of the prints arent to bad for this type of camera and yes easy to work the features unfortunately when its on and panel slightly closes it shuts the camera off for  i tried charging it and doing a hard reset with no luck of power when it comes back on the battery is already drained and have to wait for it to charge could have been greatit was defective
2106,1,i purchased this gift for my nieces the films are coming out white maybe out of  probably only  or  come out alright i dont recommend it unless maybe they sent me a bad batch of films either way it feels like a waste of money hopefully the seller can replace them and my niece can actually use itfilm packages are defective
2037,2,purchased brand new camera i am using recommended unexpired film i stepped outside for  minute to take pictures and got bluewhite streaking i was not outside more than  seconds i checked and cleaned the rollers i put the picture directly from camera under a dark mat on my table and the camera has a film shield kind of bummed out any tipspicture quality with new camera
7222,1,i did not order this nor did i receive this item therefore i cannot give a proper review on an item that i did not or receivedhuh
13995,5,you havent had rice until you have this rice cooker makes it perfect every timebest rice
13535,4,i purchased this rice cooker mainly to make rice i like everything about it except when the rice is cooking the lid is on tight and the water is boiling the water splashes out of the hole in the lid and also between the lid and the metal pot ive started to put a towel underneath but the starchy boiling water splashes all over my stove i have since started to keep the lid ajar and that seems to help one just needs to put the lid completely on the pot after the water has boiled and is absorbed into the riceneed to keep the lid ajar while water is boiling
545,1,sony doesnt stand by their product i had my camera for  month and the shutter button fell off when i called the repair center i did what they said shipped the camera in the original box to the repair center and the receipt and all which i did one week later i was told that sony would not stand by their product and their  year warranty what other sony products will they not stand bysony doesnt stand by their product i had my 
14105,5,this rice cooker is amazing i can make soup with it in under two hours and rice only takes  minutes to cook my rice will stay warm for over six hours as well i totally recommend this productpretty and good quality
9221,1,this product is not suitable for purposes intendedim disappointed with this product so it being returned
10322,5,"mom has an electric stovei have gasi couldnt figure out how to make rice one moms stove either over or under done almost always bubbling over making a mess on my stove  great  but i had to pay attention no more yea meeasy peasy lemon squeezy scoop rinse fill  to the appropriate line press a button now you can pay attention to your steak you definitely dont want to over cook thatim sure the  fuzzy logic rice cookers are great i hope its far superior but i like the rice this one makes  so it would seem i have saved  someday ill have to try some fuzzy riceomg i love this thing"
5139,1,i had this camera for a day before returning it it was a big waste of money the images came out really blurry and pixelated i dont recommend buying itwaste of money
7617,1,its junk save your moneynot enough light very poor product
6067,2,these are really for the very young the higher level age group you stated were not interested in these they thought of them more as kid toys i should have went with the cameras for teens or adults my  grandchildren ages from  lost interest in  days with about  pics between them but they enjoyed the underwater videosthey were somewhat easy to operateso much smaller than represented
4115,2,i really wanted to give a good review but the concept is great but for a networking company netgear should be embarrassed with this product i have the  camera wireless setup which i purchased for  and i also have a uokoo single wireless camera i bought for  youll never believe which works best imagine this i get a motion notification on my phone from the netgear of activity app i open it and it takes upto  seconds or more to buffer before i get video you might say its my network connect right but no same phone same time i can connect to my uokoo camera in under  seconds i can hit the record button on my uokoo camera app and record until my phonedesktop storage fills up with the netgear i hit record and it loses connection  to  seconds in and stops recording every time to make matters worst i then have to restart the app because it says the devices failed to connect try again i cant have this is someone is attempting a break in also the uokoo camera picks up motion and reports it instantly the netgear system has about a  seconds delay ups guy is almost off my porch before im notified anything happened and yes all cameras are exactly the same distance away from the wifi routerbase station this is definitely an issue between the cameras and the base station or the app just sucks which netgear will not admit to either oh and you cant change the wifi channel the cameras run on which also sucksthe reason i wanted to give this a good rating is because of the ease to setting up and mounting the cameras the video quality is excellent but the buffering delays and network disconnects almost render this system useless im going wired from now oni really wanted to give a good review but
14958,5,used many times still like newworks good well built
2043,2,i cant tell you how annoyed i am with this camera when i powered it on it kept powering down after a few seconds turned out the battery was low so i replaced it and tried again but this time the paper jammed so i pulled it out and put in a new one this time it worked thank godso annoyed
1114,2,quality could be a little better and responce time to take photo little slowslow take photos not sharp
15548,5,"theres not a lot to rice cookers honestly they cook and shut off after a period of time or rather because of heat its an interesting basic bit of physics so what about this one specifically looks nice its a clean look even for rice cookers which dont generally have much to them its easy enough to clean granted rice itself shouldnt be that hard to clean but this does come with a little minicookbook with ideas on other things to make in this proportions etc which could be a bit messier this has got a nice surface on the inside which seems like itll make cleanup less of a hassle it does come with a cookbook as well as instructions ok a small one with a few ideas in sometimes not perfectly translated english to get you started but its enough to get someone thinking eh it just cooks rice into thinking of other things this might be used forthats  really about it its a simple device but this is a nice implementation of it  with a guide on the side worth picking up if you use normal rice with any frequency not something like minute ricerice cooker what cooks rice"
13212,5,mine just stopped working after maybe  uses dont recommenddont recommend
8346,1,camera and products felt very low quality i returned the products but have not received my money back i received a confirmation of delivery from ups i have tried talking to customer service but they told me to wait it has been months and no updatelow quality and bad customer service
3941,1,i was upset that i ordered purple and what arrived was blue it was a birthday gift for my granddaughter she said it was ok and wanted to use it right away if she wasnt so excited to use it i would have sent it backi ordered purple what arrived was blueit was a birthday present very disappointed
5205,2,my  yr old can can operate it but its so tiny thats the only real drawbackok but
1766,2,i work at a school and purchased  of these cameras through amazon for a kids project three of the five cameras broke one immediately which i returned and two after the deadline for returning so i now have two functioning cameras of five these cameras and the film are too expensive to be this unreliablepurchased  of these  broke almost immediately
4881,1,broke within a few uses my sisterinlaw bought a  one and it broke the same day save your moneybroke twice
17193,5,nice variety of cooking methods bought this for my wife for christmas and we use it atleast twice a week good size for the  of us nice heavy duty cast iron with non stick removable pot too a looks great best thing ever
3163,1,thought this would be a great intro for our daughter no i couldnt even figure out how to work it blurry pics slow processingjust no
1990,1, you have to have the lights super bright to get any exposure the flash is  the resolution on polaroids we took in the  is still better that any of the pics taken with this camera so farthe one i got my daughter was the one that takes mini pics and it works great maybe this batch of film that came with the camera is junk so far my advice would be to save your moneyjunk not the polaroid of old
13751,5,before i bought the zojirushi i had a zojirushi bread maker it was a bit more expansive than regular brands but boy bread after bread after bread came out so well i never had a failed bread so that made me a fan of this brand they are japanese and their main business is actually making rice cookers so i decided to buy this standard rice cooker i bought the  cup cause the steaming tray was bigger so it would be easier to steam fish and veggies believe it or not but that was the main reason i was buying a new rice cooker i wanted to steam more veggies and fish but boy oh boy the rice taste actually better than in a cheaper rice cooker it also burns less almost never so if you just like me and you like to eat rice veggies fish this one would be a good upgrade if you have already a cheaper rice cooker or if youre debating buying a rice cooker and are not sure if you would buy a cheaper one or this onegood upgrade to a regular rice cooker recommended
5140,1,not as advertised first its definitely not  megapixels false advertisement pictures are just so so plastic body with rubber coating my phone takes better pictures than this thing bottom line is that you pay for what you getabsolutely not  megapixels
15643,5,since im married to an asian woman we make and eat a lot of rice  and have a really nice expensive rice cooker this product was purchased as an emergency backupspare while it only makes up to  cups of rice it does a good job of cooking that rice  but its important to follow the ricewater ratio after cooking it goes into warm mode automatically which is really nice as wellmakes really nice rice but just big enough for a few people
3581,1,if something is required to make it work is should be listed in the description but the only warning is choking hazardthe clamshell comes with a paper interior which is inappropriate for any wetsnowy activityalong with the discontinuation of the desktop editor gopro is rapidly becoming less of a professional sports camerai am returning this and considering a competitorapp is required to get the camera working
857,2,just stick to your cell phone while its cute its not so cute when the pic is washedim finding most pics are washed out
17324,5,began stalking this item when recommended to me by a coworker i have never used a rice cooker before i was hesitant to purchase because of the price but eventually gave in i am so glad i did makes the best rice even beautifully cooked brown rice keeps warm for days easy to clean  even my children love to make rice with it the only con is that it does take a while to make the rice  longer than stove top cooking times  minutes for jasmine  brown  minutes for soft white depending on how much youre making but as long as you know this you can better plan your cooking accordingly i highly recommend this item to othersamazing japanese rice cooker
9477,5,ive been using aroma brand for years my last one still worked but it had an accident my fault this upgraded one is so much better seems a little larger and sturdier and works perfect like my previous one always use the measuring cup that comes with it and you cant go wrong for white rice i use two cups water one cup rice and extra splash of water a little margarine and salt for brown rice i use  cups plus about  extra water and i always add  tablespoons of wild rice and some margarine and a sprinkle of salt i would recommend unplugging as soon as its done otherwise will scorch the rice simple and reliable highly recommended im just cooking for myself so the  cup cooker is perfect if you like extra rice for the next dayalways reliable
17499,5,this is worth it if you eat rice often i was nervous to buy such an expensive rice cooker trying to think what it could do over my previous  one which did its job pretty okay or so i thought the cook on the previous rice cooker was uneven and the bottom sometimes hard this thing makes every grain the same and keeps it that was for at least  hours with the extended keep warm the options and quality make it worth it if you eat rice often if you only do so once in blue moon it might not be worth itworthwhile if you eat a lot of rice
19,5,work greatlove it
6853,1,i know i shouldnt have expected much for the money but its still worse than expected the pictures are grainy and blurry maybe okay to give to a child as a toy but useless as a real cameracheap  grainy
6653,1,ended up returning  feels cheapreturned
9617,4,works like it suppose to loldoes what its suppose to
2437,2,this camera is not worth your money save up and buy something more professionalsave your money  get something better
14469,5,i had been holding out on buying a rice cooker but finally decided in this one after reading positive reviews the days of inconsistent cooked rice is over this rice cooker cooks rice perfectly every time its very easy to clean i like how compact it is and the easy carry handle is a great feature i highly recommend this rice cookercooks perfect rice
16889,4,everything seems to be good except its hard to see the lines in the pot when making ricegreat looking rice cooker
3416,2,view finder seems off pulling to my right but maybe my glasses took two very washed out photos of my husband in my dining room as the setting sun was filtered into the room thru the trees in our side yard disappointed in the blurry quality of the photos flash came on outside photos of my cat a little better still blurry compared to digital iphone  shots may improve some the more used first phots my have been off because of glasses outside shots were taken without glasses better centering will probably send back this camerasince i have much better photo taking tools had hoped to give it to my great niece and had bought two one to try one for gift looks like both will be returned too bad would be great first camera for child though or a young preteenpoor quality photos
9074,1,polaroid should have a word with amazon about shipping expired film its a bad look for both of them will not order film from amazon againreceived expired film
5301,2,it is a great product cant wait for my next tripit is a great product cant wait for my next trip
1488,1,it was not put together well and the picture was blurryvery disappointed
15799,5,this moosum electric rice cooker is the perfect size for a family meal weve cooked white and brown rice and turmeric quinoa i am extremely pleased with how easy it is to clean it is so small  not much bigger than a sauce pan but makes all of  cups of rice this will be perfect for the soon to be empty nest now the kids each want one for their dorm room it comes with a simple to follow recipe bookperfect size easy to clean
5322,2,more than half of the film didnt turn outdisappointed
7472,2, this is a cheap camera which does not live up to the suspicious number of  star ratings on its amazon page in this case you get what you pay for it is not a quality budget substitute for highend cameras ie industrystandard such as gopro it isnt bad if you want a cheap camera to experiment with firsttime amateur pov filming or for young kids to play with but thats about itpluses  comes with a lot of mounting  decent hd images in flat light at slow  comes with   has  adjustable view angleminuses  electronic image stabilization is minimally functional the video i included shows how much movement there is with eis on it seems to particularly struggle around corners and is even worse with helmetmount video is chestmount eis on this camera is no better than shooting video on most smartphones although it is several hundred dollars less expensive so i suppose thats something also it will not record in  with eis onautomatically defaults to  image quality poor in bright light loses detail and washes out badlynot evident on included video which was an overcast day and video capture rate seems to lag the faster you go so playback becomes even more jerky and  batteries run out quickly do not last anywhere near  minutes as  touchscreen icons are nonstandard and can be confusing submenus are not intuitive hard to find some  owners manual has multiple misspellings and inconsistent grammar doesnt give useful instructions seems literallydirectly translated into rather than written in english if that matters to  sound recording is almost exclusively wind noise unless youre moving slowly commentary nearly inaudible particularly during downhill  datetime stamp on videos changed even though all videos were shot same day the first  recordings showed correct date aug   on sd card when opened on my computer the next  showed aug   for no apparent reason you have to set datetime at first use possibly need to reset each time you change the battery although i havent figured this out  battery meter on camera is unreliable more than once its showed halffull battery but after starting to record battery meter dropped to zerocharge and camera shut off within seconds ive used each battery a total of  times since i got the camera so its not from excessive battery userechargingendoflifein summary this is a cheap device to mess around with which wont produce highquality videos for your social media feed but which you dont need to save up for if you just want to experiment with pov recording its okay for entrylevel purposes if you want to make highquality movies this is not the device i bought it to try pov filming see if i would enjoy making videos of my mtb rides so the cheap cost was a selling point if i wanted to make videos to share and if i had a reasonable number of followers i would definitely get a more expensivemuch higher quality camerainexpensive camera functions as price would suggest
12298,5,ive had a few over the years and they put me off from making rice they would always boil causing a huge mess on the counter this one has no such issues and is so easy that i am making rice now almost every other day my wife is latina and she loves spanish rice well this cooks that perfectly too you just have to play with the recipe a bit but it is the best i cant believe i went this long without this machinebest rice cooker
8336,1,lousy clarity must have been made in the 
9320,4,this is a decent basic rice cooker it has a basket that can be used for steaming and has a vented top this really is a set it and forget it cooker it holds the temp well after cooking but it does brown the rice on the bottom a little bit but doesnt burn its easy to clean and the ceramic coating is a good addition to something like this the price is okay for what it is a no frills rice cookersteamernice no frills rice cooker
3703,1,horrible item i paid  for a craftman light at lowes and gives way more light than this for the price i thought i was going to be getting a crazy amount of light and i didntit is a horrible product will not recommend buying it giving a  star cause i have to give a star in order to give review but if not i would give no stars at allhorrible product
5238,2,i sent it back and got the   wow what a difference thank you amazonim disappointed at some of the reviewers boasting they feel they got a  at a  price this is still a  and is meant for a very large but very neophyte audience nikon knew there were millions looking for a dslr for   maybe so they could say they had one well here it is and believe me you get what you pay for if you believe the egos of the prior reviewers youll certainly be disappointed when you try take this camera out of the simple pictureled guide modetrue this camera is very much entrylevel but its real entry level and the  does not look like   unfortunately the way the computer processes the image it ends up looks more like  the images are hard to describe  its like theyre synthesized or over manipulated even the raw seems compressed and lossy i saw a sideside close up analysisreview of the image and although its  most of the pixels in say a  pixel radius are all the same the camera doesnt have the power to distinguish the pixels for clarity like the higher end cameras point and shoots do this as a matter of course then they brag they have  etc which may be misleading some into thinking well  is still  but its not go do your online homework and look at the analysis photos from this camera youll see what i mean  and that pans out in real life just one step up the  is  the camera and yields much brighter photos its sort of like an old round  style tv vs a new  hi res led tvits plastic case gives it a chintzy feel its very slow at shot acquisition you will certainly wait a bit till its figured out how to take the shot autofocus is awful even with  glass metering is whacked short battery life you name a bad trait and this camera has it oh  and dont get caught in the rain with it eitherhowever it is lightweight and to some thats quite important like a tourist that has to lug a his new slr all over creation when theyre used to a little pocket camera this camera is  the weight of any dslrand it also has a real dumbeddown guide that takes about  seconds to setup a shot  so that whole sophomoric  level guide thing is a bust and the scene selector on top doesnt help at all either in both my wifes my  yr old son my and my moms use about  shots were blurred misflashed misexposed to way out of proportions etc so why have  for a camera that cant handle itthe lens that it comes with mandatory is just more cheap plastic mess if this camera was sold wo the lens it would be in the  range we put a  lens on this camera with little improvement  it still just cant cope dont fool yourself into thinking youre clever by purchasing a  camera for  youve got a  camerabut i wouldnt waste your timemoney  get the  and be done with it if youre that hard up for  where you cantwont shell out another  for the pro camera then go back to a point and shoottoyish plastic  made for a the  pointshoot crowd
8350,1,does not come with everything in the picture like not even close to any of it waste of money disappointed that and the camera it self takes mid picsdont waste your money
9788,4,it gets the job done well i just wish it would stay on and keep the rice hydrated for more than half a day if you want to make batches of rice that will go for more than a day maybe get a different rice cookerautoshutoff after  hours
3158,1,this is not what i wanted its no bigger than  inches this is so cheap made not happy do not buy
2562,1,we love this dino camera but the battery stopped holding charge gave it to my son for christmas it only works when plugged in would love a replacement but cant figure out how to contact sellerbattery wont hold charge
14290,5,the quick cook function is awesome only takes  minslove it
14250,5,this was bought as a gift so giving a second hand use account for price and quality i did my research and it is a great deal very well made and consistent cook the user end loves it and uses all the time it is not one of your top brand japanese cookers but for the prices i was told the quality is excellent  easy to clean and compact for those with limited kitchen spaceperfect rice cooker for the price
5945,1,these are for  boys what a disappointment they are not going to like pink  gift is ruinedpink album and case 
9285,5,good quality this is a small cute rice cooker but it is just what i want its only enough for  people so its very suitable for single person or small family like me its easy to use and easy to clean it cant set up cook time but its ok i am not care about i am so satisfied with this rice cooker so fargood for single or small family
5263,2,i think this is potentially a nice camera ive had a constant problem with the lens we get an error messagge almost every time we change lenses it says  lense not attached with some twisting it does finally make contact and the lens will work for a timeamazons side of the transaction was great deivered on time and in good shape i need to return it so nikon can address the issuecamera has technical problems
12659,5,perfect for one person cooks  cup of rice with  cup of water at a timegood little cooker
13265,5,it works amazing however i didnt read the dimensions and it is a lot larger than i thought it was i thought this was a little cute one and it is cute but it can make up to  cups of rice i am one person no one needs that much ricesize matters
7771,1,the picture quality was very poor even for a kids camera also had to reset the unit due to freezing several times within the first hour was a great deal for lightning deal price but unfortunately the quality wasnt there had to returnquality not good even for kids camera
13920,5,rice comes out perfecteasy to clean
8604,1,no driver no good no autofocus was too good to be true 
7002,1,it was working ok since i bought it then suddenly thousands of thm files started showing up on the sd card apparently theres no way to stop them it makes it difficult to download the jpegs pictures to my computer i tried reformatting the sd card tried another sd card but it does the same thing i looked all through the manual and it never mentions the thm file i think its an error in the camera itselfbesides that it doesnt always focus and sometimes doesnt even take the picture when the button is pressed im pretty disappointedsuddenly started adding thm files along with the pictures
5642,1,you get what you paid for cheap camera cheap quality thats my review in a nut shelloverall cheap
11950,5,perfect we already have one needed it for our  home in phoenixconsistency
3211,1,the flash came completely dead i cant even shoot with it huge disappointmentdidnt even shoot a single image
9598,5,its perfect for single people or a couple it cooks perfectly everytime yes it makes a mess through the little hole on top but its an easy clean upits small and compact
4106,1,i own three arlo pros the pros work fine although the motion detection is a bit lethargici wanted to add two additional cameras to my system and bought a pair of these arlos here is what is wrong with these  not rechargeable  these cameras suck the power out of batteries within  days note  ive looked on arlos qa and the camera has a good signal and only recording a couple of events a day so it isnt the location or set  batteries are  motion detection is so lethargic i only get the tails of animals and the back  of vehicles terribly frustrating knowing something was there but no way of knowing  within  days of using this pair one of the two cameras is stuck in infrared mode leaving a constant pink picture awfulthe set up was easy but the cameras are almost useless for a property you only visit each  or  weeks because batteries are constantly going dead seems arlo has an issue if you check their qa regarding the battery drain they only recommend to relocate camera or reduce recordings but guess what that doesnt fix the issue alsoseems quite a bit of chatter on their qa site about cameras being stuck in infrared mode also i am terribly disappointedmy  arlo pros have performed fine by the wayi am attaching a photo of my lovely pink screen it has been  weeks all but  days in the middle the camera has been stuck in night vision mode turn off and on and so in to no availalso note in the bottom image brand new batteries installed  hours ago and it has already drained to  all with zero activity recordedso it isnt the activity duty cyclethe basic arlo camera suck batteries in days arlo pros are much much better i have both types
10217,4,the cooker is super easy to use and it makes good rice i have no idea how to clean the lid  steam collects inside the rubber lining and is not easy to wipe out i see no way to remove the parts to clean it bettermakes good rice
4609,2,cute product and would be great if it worked but it stopped working after  dayso cute
939,1,pure junk another great product from chinajunk
3091,2,im a tried and true polaroid fan i have been shooting film in  medium and large format for years and have plenty of experience i have plenty of polaroid cameras in my collection too and wow i gotta say this is some of the worst film i have used see my quick comparison image between this film and fujifilm instax heres whycolor  functionthe color on this film is horrible it is extremely cool and does not perform well in mid to lowlight conditions yes even with the use of a flash with my polaroid go the images often print dark and at times are even cracked at the edges the contrast is far too great on this film removing much of the surrounding environment and would only perform well in very very bright areas and before you assume i got an expired pack of film i purchased  different packs and they all performed consistently poorly i may have had one image out of each pack that was somewhat okayoveralli made a big investment on a lot of this film and was extremely disappointed i do not recommend i never thought i would say bump polaroid for fujifilm instax but the instax continues to perform better in my experience my original polaroid film from the  even performs better than their newly produced film i still have some original film left and i am cherishing it because this new stuff stanki hate to say this
3652,1,change the batteries right away dont use the ones that come with quick flashing orange light means batteries are dead or dont have enough juice to take the picture also the button that pops open the lens sticks and now is jammed and havent even put a whole pack of film through yet i wouldnt buy this model ever again too many problemschange batteries right away
8430,1,dislike the fact that the printer runs out of ink and ink cant be added the pack of paper that came with the printer is all that was needed since the printer ran out of ink the printer doesnt work so the extra paper wasnt necessaryorder extra paper but the printer doesnt work dont need it
8285,1,bought two unicorn theme devices for my daughters  birthday this and a light up night light both are junk neither will charge obviously the bigger problem is that i now cant return either since the boxes were discarded long before we realized they wouldnt charge back up what a scam dont buybroken wont charge
12236,5,weve had a a very old rival rice cooker for years it served well for making generic rice as the base jambalaya and other rice dishes but with a change in diet rice has become the main dish and this cooker wasis a game changer worlds of difference and such a great investment in a quality essential kitchen appliance very happy with the purchaseunbelieveably incredibly great rice game changer
10450,5,i have had many rice cookers  all of which ended up in the circular file gave this one a shot  love itabsolute perfection
3058,1,not worth it so not like the description and cheap cant forget really smallyeah no
4152,1,the camera is a jokegarbage
6236,2,quite difficult to use the material is a bit rigid a softer more flexible material would be betterupdatei did try and make this work but found it really is too awkward you really cant access the lens for focusing or zooming i also found the seals are water tight obviously it can only be used with a slr camera rangefinders certainly are totally defeated by this designunless you are in blowing rain a bracket for an umbrella mounted on the tripod is far more practicalawkward
3582,1,i lost this because the attachment does not work it looks like it sticks to a helmet but comes off almost immediately i hope i can get a refund because i just lost a few hundred dollars for nothingabsolutely terrible
10065,5,"doesnt take up a lot of counter space and easy to storei like black rice black rice is better for you than brown rice ive cooked it stove top and a normal rice cooker and it would come out a little under cooked so i would have to add a little more water and cook it a little longerthis rice cooker has a brownblack rice setting when i used this setting my black rice came out perfecti havent used the steamer basket yet so i cant comment on that and the rice spoon doesnt fit in the little rice holder on the side of the cooker the measuring cup that comes with it shows  cup but if you fill it to the top its a perfect  cupi will add that if you cook black rice it leaves a bluest color of water so you will definitely need to pull of the plastic cover of the top of the rice cooker to clean birth the plastic top and the top of the rice cookera great little rice cooker"
1872,2,all the photos from multiple packs have white streak through them tried all the troubleshooting it didnt help will buy from a store next timeall photos have white stream
3719,2,mine was defective products the company replaced immediatelycheap made
4066,2,i purchased  cameras in march  so i have had them a little over two years my cameras worked as advertised for the first year after the first year one of the cameras quit working i contacted the arlo netgear customer support and was never able to get the camera working again so my five camera system became a four camera systemthe battery life over time has gone way down at first the batteries would last a least a month now i feel i am changing batteries every few days it is time consuming and costlyrecently i have been experiencing a lot of issues with the cameras not connecting to the base station when checking the cameras you receive a message that says your arlo device appears offline even though the internet is working and the base station has power so there is no reason they should be offline to fix this i have to physically unplug the station and wait a minute and plug it back in this has been happening every few days so there have been multiple times where the cameras have been down and did not record anything because they could not connect to the base stationbecause of all of these issues i recently gave up on the cameras and opted to get a system that is hard wired in no more batteries and no more only recording when the camera detects motion i now have  video recording i am much happier with the new system and should have switched a year agoone final note on the arlo customer service over the years i have contacted the customer service for both technical and account related issues every time i have contacted customer service i have not been satisfied with the experience for example i was paying the  a month for more storage when i did away with the system it was very difficult to cancel the monthly subscription i spent  minutes chatting with someone through the websites chat feature then  minutes on the phone with two different people before finally they figured out i couldnt cancel the subscription right now because of a know issue with their website not working if it is a know issue shouldnt their customer support reps realized it earlier and not wasted my time putting me on hold trying to figure out why i couldnt cancel my subscription also they cant make changes to an account on their end the user must make all changes by logging into the websiteapp you would think a company could change account information for its customers but all they can do is walk you through doing it yourself onlinei recently gave up on changing batteries and quit using the cameras i opted for a better quality camera that is wired in and records  yes the wired system was a lot harder to install because we had to run wires throughout the attic but it has been well worth itdont last over time
3378,1,it was a piece of garbage it broke before i had a chance too use iti want my money back
8990,1,put the first film in and when it went to eject the protective cover on the film it got stuck on the way out sent it right backbroke very first use
1118,1,this camera is only good for picture taking the quality of the photos is meh at best but the video mode stinks you absolutely cannot get a video that isnt jerky and garbled on any setting from hd to  the only setting on video that works and removes the jerkiness is the lowest setting which is vga anything above that is jerky and plays like pausegopausegopausego i was so excited to get this and then so let down by the video quality as that is primarily what i was going to use it for which was youtube video so now i have to send it back better to shell out the  to purchase a canon or sony camera for what i needonly good for picture taking video is awful
9154,1,unfortunately this camera did not work for me the color is cute and it is very lightweight but the usb cord is in an awkward location and does not fit the camera properly after  hours still no charge im returning this onereturning this camera
8804,2,not good quality photos cant see the picturenot worth the money
3951,1, do not buy this product it only works for a couple of shots and then stops working when you troubleshoot all the issues put new film and new batteries it gets stuck in this mode where it just flashes the lights as seen i am extremely unhappy with this purchasedo not buy
8347,2,good for beginnersnice camera if you are just starting out
6900,1,i used this product for  days and the power button stopped working i wasted my money on this thing dont waste your time or money on thisworst camera ever
12943,5,"this is not your standard rice cooker i am so glad we got this rice cookerill start with the steaming the basket to steam is larger than i have ever seen in rice cookers normally they have a small thing that sits at the top and you can fit  large eggs to steam the cosori actually has a bucket you could do many more eggs and actually do a decent amount of veggiessettings for rice are simple and easy you can adjust the mushyness of your rice i personally like my rice little hard heck they have a sushi setting so you can make your own sushi riceoatmeal dont get me started on the oatmeal i love me some oatmeal this machine does it flawlessly just put a cup of oats in a cup of water and vrala they are done no need to babysit the oats on the stove top anymore there are three oatmeal settingscleanup is a breeze the nonstick pot is amazing the underside of the lid pops off just allaround great rice cookerwe have just begun with the cosori rice cooker they supply a cookbook and we intend to mark them off as we make themworth the price of rice"
16912,5,love this my fiance loves it toolove itttt
6103,1,the camera came in great condition but i wished that the shutter botton workedthis camera came great condition i just wish that the shutter botton just worked
11511,5,"this rice cooker is both adorable and functional it makes light and fluffy rice that isnt too damp or too dry its easy to use and easy to clean the best thing about it is that its the perfect size for one or two peoplethis rice cooker is the perfect gift for yourself or someone else it would be perfect as a graduation gift wedding gift or housewarming gift for a single person or couple it looks absolutely adorable the pink version is exactly what i wanted it stands out as something very cute in a kitchen full of useful but plain tools and appliancesmy only two complaints about this rice cooker are very small but its that cleaning out the inner rice pot can be a little more difficult for those with larger hands and that when you initially open the lid it spills water down the lid onto the base the rice pot is very small compared to a standard pot and might pose some challenges for those with big hands for most people it wont really be an issue but i feel its important to point out additionally having to towel off the water that spills off the lid onto the base is a little annoying when you open it but considering the perfect condition of the rice and the fact that it doesnt sputter out water while cooking i consider it a small price to payoverall i love this rice cooker and highly recommend it it has a ton of personality for such a basic tool and it does its job very wellprefect little rice cooker for  or  people"
2244,1,stopped working almost immediately first week and the customer service wont reply bewaremalfunctioned after one weekavoid
2553,2,pictures are black and whitepoor quality bearly visiblecamera
15883,5,suitable for  servings easy to clean it cooks so fast only  mins for the full pot im happy with the purchaseso far so good
2488,2,pics are grainy low quality does strange things to the lighting like the exposure would never look good no matter what settings are used colors ended up weirdly saturated in lowlightits a hassle to switch between settings while trying to take pics if youre not completely still forget about it the pic isnt gonna come out that greati took over  pics all different settings and things and this camera just aint itashamed to say i bought it mostly for the aesthetic hoping the pics would be good enough its an adorable looking camera unfortunately it feels really cheap would maybe be cool for like  bucks but def not worth  not worth the money
5523,2,images were worse than the prior model compared to a nikon   the images were awful the video was okay but then if you zoom in or out you can hear the mechanical sound of the zoom returned because of that did not feel good in my hand  the camera body is very similar to others again nearly identical in feel to the nikon  but the images on the nikon are much much better i used to have a prior lumix model  a point and shoot that was flat so you could put in your pocket not sure that one is still available but that was better than thisawful  not as good as the older models
4693,1,this has problems it starts to work but if you even just breathe on it it shorts out and doesnt show up on the computeri tried it on my mac book pro and on my samsung windows laptop did the same on bothshorts out if the laptop is moved even slightly useless

9088,1,just opened the package and all the film print like this  bad film they are sellingbad film
1140,1,picture and video quality is bssucks
5327,1,idk if its the camera or a bad batch of film but its my first time using it and all my pictures are coming out black and one came out blankbad film
6743,1,i ordered these as they were the recommended refill paper rolls for the joytrip kids printing camera however they are too big and do not fit in the camera do not order these as suggested theyre being returnedtheyre too big
8786,1,this thing doesnt take good photos indoors outdoors with a flash or with fullsun the film just isnt exposed enough or something im not a scientist i dont know why but this thing suckstakes poor quality pictures
3585,1,i have very bad experience with gopros battery going hot very quick and couldnt film more than  min because this issuebattery life issue
3759,1,i bought this for my daughter for christmas in anticipation of a big trip we have coming up she didnt tell me shes been unable to use it because it wont charge until now so i tired charging it and she is right it works while plugged in but unmediated goes black when you take it off the charge while charging it continually blinks red so unfortunately it is way past the return time and now im paying double for the camera because i have to buy a new one so bummed hopefully this next one workswont work
4392,2,we purchased this frame to display family photos and we were intrigued by the ability of family members to send directly to the frame after setting up our initial album which included some videos it became apparent that the videos would not play the manual nor the pix star site gave this information and we searched to find a solution to this problem after googling this we discovered that videos embedded within a photo album would not play but the thumbnail showing it was a video does show up on the photo this was very disappointing because all the information we had seen said the frame would play videos we then tried using the online radio feature and could not get any of the stations we tried to work i did contact customer support and they pointed out that videos can be played if they are sent separately or from a thumb drive but we would need to change the pixels and resize itwhat regarding the radio it was suggested that we try a different station as the stations listed may no longer be streaming overall the picture quality is great but there are more disappointments than pluses with this framefrustration and disappointment
7556,2,there is no flash so picture quality varies with the lighting takes good pictures of the tv screen toddler likes to take pics of thatthe kid loves it battery has a decent life for as much as a  year old fidgets with it it was fairly easy for him to figure out how to work he has taken  picscame with a good amount of accessories memory card is large and it has everything you need to put them on a computerdrawbacksno flash most pictures are not visable due to low lightbig issue the micro sd card must be inserted very carefully my first attempt at putting the card back in the camera was a disaster the card did not go in the slot it went into the camera casing and was lost inside rattling around i was able to remove the screws with some difficulty and retrieve the sd card it seemed to work properly after i reassembled the camera so it may have not been seated properly when it was originally installedover allit is what i wanted which was a fun small camera for the kid to play with his approval is pretty high but he does a very sad awww when his pictures dont turn out because of poor lighting for his next one i will be looking for one with a flashupdate the battery came loose inside the case and broke the capacitor for the screen camera makes sound but the screen no longer shows anythingmy grandson was heartbroken he was very careful with it and used it every time he visited i ended up buying him a real camera so he can take picturesi may have just got a bad one but it wasnt assembled correctly from the beginning the sd card slot was off resulting in the card falling inside the case and the battery wasnt inserted correctly causing it to come loose inside and cause damagemy recommendation find a different product with a flash my grandson was totally uninterested in the games just the camera functionsupdate very poorly constructed loose parts things inside were not put together right and it broke
3898,1,never got to use it memory card would not click in dont understand all the great reviews it is a piece of cheap junkdolt waste your money
15413,4,it is a little weird to figure out how to use at first my biggest complaint was that when i bought this it was marketed as a pressure cooker it is not there is no steam adjusting its basically a rice cookersteamer with longer times it takes forever to heat up for a sautenot bad for price
14140,5,bears easytouse brand its convenient to stew meat and cook ricefavorite color
15338,5,bought two for  of my kids as described awesome packing worth the moneygreat for gift
7547,2,camera stopped working  month in lost all my video and image we booked a trip to cozumel scuba diving we recorded a lot of amazing video and pictures unfortunately when we got back and tried to import the videos none of the video would load no matter what we do it just says error we spent hours trying to fix it we lost  hours of amazing footages which we will never get back then the second day when we tried to take more pictures and recording none of them worked we missed out on all of the images and recording of our experience we were so excited to see what we captured under the ocean and of course it is just barely out of the warranty this is very upsetting i wish it wouldve just not turned on instead of pretend to work and then lose all of our captureslost all my images and recordings during our vacation in cozumel
2158,2,i ended up using the backdrop took pics with the flash of my camera it was the better result the led lights here were too weak they looked anemic and washed out should have known better with the few led lights overhead belatedly adjusted setting and program on my camera then went back to my cell phone camera its got its pros and cons no need to waste your money just get a normal backdrop and get real spotlights dont know how other people could accept this quality but your flashes will do a better job also the openings are too narrow difficult to lean in by the way the pic on the left is using the tents led while the one on the right is no led with just my cameras flash in the end i went back to my natural skylights and my cell phone camera so no night time shoots for me spending  after tax did not make it better nor easier so this is still going backit was the better result the led lights herewere too weak
8809,1,pictures show very dark and of course the pictures are very small definitely not worth the moneythis product is a no
5117,2,i saw it on tiktok and i wanted to save money but the photo quality is not good my phone camera is a lot better you basically get what you pay for ill be returningtiktok made me buy it
5955,1,i was expecting a low quality camera for my daughters birthdays gift but not this piece of sthis is definitly a waste of money first the camera quality is such awful even a  old cell phone is bettertheres so many noise at low light even when using the flashthe camera crashed constantly when browsing the pictures taken i just got  pic in memorythe pic loading time is soooo slow almost  per pictureit doent come with a charger but just an usb cablethe printer didnt work at all impossible to print any picturesno possibility to set the microsd card as the default browsing picture folder it means each time you want to browse them you need to choose between the internal memory or the sd not user friend at allall the picture taken are not saved by default you need to confirm the saving manually using the ok buttonno firmware update since  which means that kodak intentionally decided to not take of their own productkodak never again  
8024,1,april  updatei regret buying thisit is not perfectly centered thus everything looks off when rotatingthe background holder to the extension kit doesnt stay put togetheroctober   reviewthe spinner is massive and heavymine came with all the parts and then some some of the parts for feet seem unnecessarythe spinner over engineered which is not a bad thing though it was not the easiest thing to put to togethermy complaint for the spinner is the followingit is hard to find the center of the table with my camerasit could use a different style camera for bigger cameras my cinema style camera does not really work with itthe extension kit is okay i bought this for the background bracket the extension tubes are pointless for memy complaints for extension kit areit was not easy to put together it took multiple attempts to get it stay togetherthe metal was not clean on the inside metal shaving came out and got all over floor it was a pain to clean upnot worth the pruiuce
5394,2,the quality of photos were unpredictable i was using the camera for work i take a lot of outdoor photos i could take multiple photos of the same subject and they would all come out different even using the same settings the display screen is hard to see when outdoors and the amount of subject you can get in the screen standing near is less the zoom delivered blurry photos alsounpredictable
11442,5,love the color and the utilitypretty in pastel pink
13725,4,"my wife and i needed a new rice cooker and this works great for white and brown rice im not sure about all the negative reviews with respect to brown rice as the instructions seem focused on brown ricei generally find that the cooker works as advertised we mostly use it for brown rice  and in general people need to be aware that the bran around brown rice generally makes brown rice a tougher product the final cooked rice isnt much different than what i get on a stove top like any product you may have to make slight adjustments to suit your tastes if i know i want a more tender rice product i will add what amounts to a tablespoon extra of water and a little olive oilthe complaint about the device spitting a lot are well founded but i have yet to own a rice cooker  now from  different brands that doesnt have this problem i usually put a small napkin over the vent to keep from making a big rice starch mess i cant knock the device as a vent is needed or the process doesnt workcleanup of the device seems to be fairly easy i find it works best if you let it cool down before cleaning the cooked on rice will generally release quite easily soaking the cooker will help prevent damaging of the bowlthe only complaint i have and the reason for knocking one star is that on completion of cooking the cooker goes into a warming mode this warming mode runs too hot and will eventually burn your rice im not sure why it is needed my previous two cookers would just flat out turn off and the rice would stay hot for a good hour anyway on this one i have to make a conscious effort to unplug the cooker if i plan on letting it sit this may be a deal breaker for some i bet that this extra cooking accounts for a lot of the damage to the pot that occurs as described in other reviewsworks great"
4862,1,the camera i received was defective it would not switch from indoor to any other options and the film that came with it was expired so none of the photos turned outdefective merchandise
7856,2,i was so excited to get this and use it for my journal but it crops everything i send it ugh i havent found a way to make the initial picture smaller but of course it will let me make it so big it only prints one letter at a time it might be ok if i was only going to print pictures rather than pins or memesor texts that i found interesting or valuable things that didnt have an absolute edge but as it stands its got to go back its useless to me like it is and im really disappointed unusable
10462,5,where to start on this well i absolutely love the pink color it small enough for just me and it cooks all the rice perfectly be for i couldnt cook rice for nothing but now that i have the rice cooker i can bc it does all the work if u thank u r going to get it get it but its not big enough for a whole family thorice cooker
7644,2,camera came as expected along with the case but the main reason i got this specific bundle was because it had  film photos included i couldve got this same camera for cheaper and got the filmgreat camera no film included
12757,5,i made great beef noodle soup and it is so easy an tasty the rice cooker is a good buy and i also bought cosori air fryer love themwonderful kitechen tool for people who love soup
7861,2,the picture quality isnt consistent some pictures come out really good and some look like  the app is buggy and has glitches i dont understand the  star ratingsdisappointing
5651,1,we bought this camera for my son who has a natural eye for and interest in photography unfortunately the camera has large pieces of dustlint trapped between the glass on the lens which creates noticeable blemishes on all of the pictures rendering the camera basically unusable aside from that the camera feels pretty cheaply made and i cant say i would recommend even without the dust issue i wish wed gone with a different optiondust inside the lens
5293,1,got just the lens no camera dont buyone star
8624,2,will drain batteries and is cheapcheap battery drainer
2325,1,ordered camera got it very quickly tried to use it and battery would not hold a charge camera would only work when connected to charger bad battery amazon would not replace battery or exchange camera for another camera instead would only offer me a refund and ship it backextremely unhappyonly giving this a one star because amazon would not accept a zero ratingnot happy with camera or service
8965,1,heavy bulky and not easy to usenot easy to use
5053,1,stopped working after a few weeks we didnt even get to use the film it came with i see a lot of other reviewers have had the same problem we probably used it all of  times  stopped working just as soon as i got it
14848,5,the elite gourmet  electric rice cooker is a versatile and reliable kitchen appliance with its automatic keep warm feature you can enjoy perfectly cooked rice soups stews grains and hot cereals whenever youre ready the cooker has a capacity of  cups cooked rice  cups uncooked making it suitable for small to mediumsized households its compact design and easytouse functions make it a convenient addition to any kitchenconvenient addition to any kitchen
2182,1,edit it has been almost  weeks and i still dont have a refund from amazon its amazing how third party items are refunded as soon as the item is shippedthis is the perfect size for large items i used it twice and the lighting was nice however the lights get very hot and there is not a dimming option or an onoff switch you have to unplug the item to turn off the lightsthe worst part was it quit working after i had used it twice its huge and i had already thrown the box away it was a lot of work to find new packaging to return it and unlike most other purchases amazon doesnt refund your money when the return is scanned my item has now been sitting in their warehouse for well over  days and i still dont have my money backtheyre oos so no way to get a replacement this was a very unsatisfactory purchaseused twice stopped working return huge hassle
1088,2,disappointed to discover that although advertised as compatible for webcam use the usb output was only  and quite low quality hdmi output is locked to the viewfinder output so it always contains the user interface icons i was unable to find a way to disable this overlay and also found the hdmi connection itself to be unreliable after being cycled a few timesi refrain from  star because for the price this little camera takes decent photos and videos if you are trying to use it for camera uses and not for full hd webcam usedecent camera performance no clean hdmi out
16661,5,i thought it was too good to be true to have a quick cook setting but it worked great ive only used it once but my sticky white rice came out great in under  minutes i also enjoy that its not super bulky like other rice cookers looks good and cooks good works great
3561,1,took this on a trip and decided to get in the water with the gopro  immediately shut down now it doesnt work what a waste of moneyits not waterproof
17501,5,not only does it cook great rice it keeps rice warm and moist hours laterthe best cooker available
1017,2,so if you buy to save money beware we had to spend another  on the memory card additionally camera froze up the first day stuck in on position with flash lit and we had to remove the battery to get it working again because it would not power off cheap product that ended up costing more than doublecheap camera freezes up and you have to take battery out to reset also no memory card
9466,5,"love this rice cooker i was surprised how easy it is to use just be sure to use the measuring cup included when it says  cup its not a full measuring cup but one of the included cup add a little oilmakes perfectly cooked not crunchy ricealso makes great oatmeal with old fashioned oats just stir in the middle of cookingwhy havent i gotten one of these sooner"
11132,5,i was always skeptical of rice cookers i am old school and make the best rice however when my favorite rice pot finally kicked the bucket after  years i decided to give it a try with a rice cooker and i am so glad i did it was amazing perfectly cooked rice it is not too big to set on the counter or put under the cabinet it is small and mighty i was worried it was too small but it makes up to six cups of rice i used the  cups for my husband and i and had left over when my adult children visit their favorite meal is pork chops and rice with peas i can use the  cup or six cup i made it with no problem and rice to spare i am convinced this is a miracle rice cooker you can also use it to steam vegetables or cook soup many options i love itreally happy about this
7725,1,i had gotten it for my son for christmas he used it but quickly started complaining about it when i looked at it the screen quality sucks so bad you couldnt even see anything on it worst buy ever returned it and my son was happy and doesnt miss it at allcrappy

13559,4,"i use this to make oatmeal every morning i have the  cup cooker and it comes out awesome it saves me a lot of time by being able to make breakfast for myself my wife and our two year old all at oncerinse the oatmeal thoroughly first in a strainer then use a  ratio of oatmealwater and toss in a little salt i use old fashioned oatmeal and for  people i do  of their provided cups of oatmeal with  of their cups of water cook with the lid off or you risk a super annoying mess when the cooker switches to warm stir the oatmeal and pop the lid on and let it continue to cooksteam for another  minutes doing this results in perfectly creamy oatmeal every time where all of the oats are puffed up and fluffysoftfor two picky eaters they get a drop of vanilla  maple syrup a little cinnamon and i sneak in some hemp seeds and nutritional yeast and they both love itfor myself im not picky and prefer a nice powerhouse breakfast so i do cinnamon turmeric tiny bit of black pepper nutritional yeast hemp seeds chia seeds flaxseed a teaspoon of chunky almond butter and some raisins every single morning and its been greatwhite rice also comes out fantastic in this  as it should no issues here brown rice i think needs a little more water than they suggest in the manual because the water dries up too quickly leaving the rice to get a little dry i need to experiment with this more since i eat brown rice way more than white but overall ive been super happy with itexcellent oatmeal and white rice  brown rice good after experimentation"
13115,5,"rice came out perfect listen if your rice is coming out crunchy or mushy thats  times out of  user error too much or too little water im filipino and i dont measure the rice or water scoop some in and use the finger tip method works every time  touch tip of finger to the top of the rice and the water should be filled to the first line on your finger look it up if this doesnt make sense i promise its perfect another thing is if your rice cookeris gushing water and rice residue everywhere youre probably just over filling one more thing is yes if you leave it overnight the bottom will crust but a little tip to keep the rice fresh throughout the day is add a wet paper towel on top of the rice but i recommend this rice cookermade rice perfectly"

9264,1,i bought this after seeing it all over tik tok but it is not worth it its cute but the camera quality is horrible not worth it

10502,5,this is the third dash item i have purchased and i love this rice cooker its easy to set up use and cleanim very pleased with this purchaseanother excellent dash product for my small kitchen
6568,1,the camera itself is fine it is the snap bridge software that comes with the camera that is just rubbish i have owned several of the nikon cameras and have been pleased with them they are older and require a cable or removing the sd card for photo transfer i specifically purchased this camera for the snap bridge software to be able to transfer photos one minute it would work the next it would not uninstalled reinstalled read forums that other customers were experiencing the same problems and they had just given up and started plugging the camera to the pc or using the sd card to transfer photos i already own a older nikon camera with a toshiba flash air sd that is very slow to transfer photos and the software works slowly on photo transfer the software interface on the nikon coolpix  software was just sad and needs a serious update i returned the camera for a refund as it was useless and did not deliver the most important feature of the camera its just easier to use my iphone to take photos and use photosync app to transfer photos to pc or transfer photos from pc to the iphone within seconds and works every time without any problems i wasted a lot of time trying to get the nikon software to work and was a complete wasteworst software ever written looks like something from the 
12293,5,best of the best fluffy rice never soak or drybad thing is it need  to cook any amount of ricebest rice cooker
7502,1, theres no remote control with my camera as stated on the box and the supposedly waterproof cases do not seal when closed oh by the way the camera needs a micro sd card which is not included in the offering and is not stated as not included another case of getting what you paid for what a joke of a productmissing parts and doesnt work as stated
1367,2,their website claims it can record for  minutes  this is nowhere near the truth whether in  or  it overheats within  minutes  and this is either in an air conditioned internal environment or  with plenty of air flow first the wifi remote viewing stops and then a few minutes after that it will stop  will refuse a return if the box has been opened and their answer to the overheating is just stop recording every  minutes disassemble the camera to allow it to cool for a few minutes then start againcan you imagine doing this if youre recording a motorcycle trip an airplane a long hike or even using it as a webcam for a zoom sessioni would have given it  star because of this but i do acknowledge that the picture quality is great and the software works really well though i admit the join point between back and front cameras is not at all usableoverheats at  minutes in  or 
17681,4,"this replaced a  year old rice cooker that i inherited from my parents i never really thought a rice cooker could make better rice over another but i was wrong my old rice cooker made rice just fine but rice that came out of this rice cooker had a fluffier feel and the rice clumped together better for easier chop stick use ive made rice in the morning and returned to eat an early dinner and the rice was still piping hot and fluffywe chose this model because three cups uncooked rice will yield way more rice than my wife and i can eat in a sitting we also liked the elongated look over the round ones because it fits perfectly between two larger appliances in our counter the inner pot is very easy to clean i just soak it in water for an hour quickly clean off the rice residue with a soft sponge in  swipes and give it rinselikessmall footprintinner pot is very easy to cleanmakes perfect stickyfluffy white ricedislikestakes an hour to cook the rice no matter the amount you are cookingmakes perfect rice"

5415,1,i bought this product for christmas gift and error three weeks late and when i did get it it was broken the camera was blurry and you cannot see any of your photos this is the worst thing ever and i will never be buying a camera from amazon again i dont recommend buying this camera please dont buy this camera worst company everhorrrible worst camera ever
3769,2,bought this for my young daughter who loves to take pictures which was a great gift initially especially since i was surprised that it came with not one but two batteries  awesome well not so fast  after about  weeks we noticed that the batteries needed to be charged repeatedly each day before they went out completely around  weeks into using this camera fairly infrequentlyoverall the camera looks pretty but having it tethered to the power outlet to use it renders it pretty much useless super frustrating especially for little one who did her best in waiting patiently to use the camera despite only being able to do so for just a few minutes if that before it shut down avoidlasted only  weeks before both defective batteries ran out
14788,5,my wife is enjoying her rice and it is tasty this rice cooker cooks the rice perfectly and in a normal amount of timerice is ready
5214,1,this camera was used i wanted to give it as a gift but its all scratchedi am very disappointedmake sure you open it an check it before giving as a gift
2797,2,i was aware this would be a cheap little camera but it definitely isnt the most user friendly to take one picture i have to hold down the button for at least  seconds and theres no flash which is definitely a huge downside theres only this small automatic light that makes no differencenot that good
2134,2,i desperately wanted to love this i mean after all this is everything an amazon seller could ever want wrong first the good partsits portable and collapes easily so it takes up very little space when not in use the material its made of is super easy to wipe clean the lights are nice and bright but depending on the angle of your shot you could end up with shadows a little practice is all this very amateur photographer needed to master the art of the noshadow angle now the ironically bad part as previously mentioned im an amazon seller amazon has very strict requirements for posting photos on their catalog pages and one of those requirements is that the background be pure white not kinda whitish not a little bit grey white with this photo studio i thought my prayers were answered i assumed that using this would net me pure white backgrounds sadly thats not the case ive created several detail pages that ended up being suppressed due to not having a you guessed it pure white background i justified the high cost of this because i figured i could ditch my online photo editing membership that runs about  bucks a month i thought this baby would pay for itself in time nope i still have to use the photo editor to whiten up my not quite white enough backgrounds now that ive beaten that to death i also have to mention the seams and folds are very obvious in pictures so youll either need to manually crop or be sure not to get the seams and folds into your shots i soooo wanted this to be the answer its notso sad too bad so very disappointed 
11050,5,way better than the last rice cooker i bought and the steaming rack is a great addition works well
269,2,my iphone  takes a better photonot good
9287,5,i use this every week to make quinoa or brown rice it is helping me eat healthier meals too so easy and cooks perfectly honestly i would be too lazy to make rice or quinoa otherwise thank my wife for getting for me last christmasworks great for quinoa too
2211,1,i opened the box and was quite impressed with the size i immediately set up to start taking photographs when i noticed something moving inside the box i looked closer and noticed multiple bug larva crawling all inside the box absolutely horrifying and beyond disgusting never got to take one photo i immediately packed it up back in the box and took it outside now i am vacuuming and scrubbing any surface that was near this box thanks amazon i really needed mystery larva how did you knowfilled with some kind of maggot larva
16274,5,all pieces includedworks as described
793,1,the picture quality is horrible it stalls it is not worth the money they were good about a refund but not worth gettingwould not recommend
4827,1,extremely disgusted with this product i was so excited to give it to my daughter as part of her graduation present but it stopped working after the second use the orange light will not move from the house setting the counter to tell you how many pictures are left isnt functioning the picture quality is subpar which i could probably deal with if the camera itself was functioning probably of course its past the return date pass on this item for sureawful
10071,5,i use this rice cooker to steam vegetables make soups and stews and cook rice it cooks white brown red and black rice perfectly the timer function is useful for me i put all my food in the cooker put it on timer and forget it it changes to warm once enough water has steamed out so the food does not burnhandy for soups and stews too
4719,1,horrible camera doesnt work and doesnt recognize memory carddefect camera
16593,5,this rice cooker sucks whatever you do do not cook anything other than white rice on this machine when cooking brown rice this machine leaks all over my counter and through the top steam hole find puddles under the machine i do not recommendleaks everywhere
13998,5,rice cooked to perfectionthe cakes even though it bakes a small batchit comes out great i love this toshibagreat multi functions
4675,1,this is a very useful device dualconnectivity via usbc and usba overall solid build quality however there was a noticeable gap between the top of the micro sd card reader and the overall case large enough for a micro sd memory card to slide up inside and rattle around there was no easy way to disassemble the unit to retrieve the card what a bother i will not buy this againit was great until the memory card got stuck inside the casing
6734,1,this company is scamming people the backpacks are very cheap material it is false advertising when you return the backpack the address they have is not a real address and they never refund vou the monev  stating the never received the returnfalse advertising
16823,5,only thing is that the lid is heavy so the entire pot jumps back when you press to open pot quick fix was i put reusable putty under each foot and it works great and does not lift off counter when opening anymoreplain and simple rice cooker
801,1,after reading the reviews for this camera i really had much higher expectations for this camera it is really lightweight which is great i have to say thats probably about its only redeeming feature the pictures are grainy and extremely low quality because i bought it for a child ill probably keep it as its a good practice camera but dont buy this if you expect to take good pictures at all i dont expect it to last long either given how cheap it is not sure where all the other reviews came from with rave reviews for this product buyer bewarecheap and low quality
14103,5,this rice cooker looks super cute the size is perfect for two to three people it is a great deal regarding its price and quality its convenient to cook rice porridge or soup we love itsuper cute and perfect
15841,5," anything that makes life a little easier helps this rice cooker fits that category once you measure your rice and water you shut the lid and turn it on the ceramic inner pot capacity looked small to me at first glance but first glances can be deceiving i poured six cups of water into the pot to see if it really is six cups  it isi like that its a onebutton operation like most rice cookers you dont have to worry about checking on the rice or turning down the heat it turns off automatically switches to warm mode when the rice is cooked it also cooks the rice fast my brief video shows brown basmati rice cooking fiercely on a fast boilbesides liking those features i like the nonstick ceramic inner pot for health reasons which is why i chose this rice cooker the ceramic pot was pretty easy to clean the cooker comes with a plastic serving spoon a plastic measuring cup  cup easy instructions a few recipes and the electric cord i hope this is helpful informationits a fast rice cooker with healthy nonstick ceramic inner pot"
7123,1,i thought this was more of a hard cover but its flexible plastic which doesnt have a photo album feel for me i returned it it would be good for businesses or something to share at a party or something but i wanted a permanent home for our instax photos and this didnt fit my needsended up returning
9720,5,my previous nine year old arome cooker failed this replacement has more features and produces the same excellent resultsgood replacement
14079,5,very good quality and design at a reasonable price i really like the flat top which allows me to put stuff on top of it while not in use its a good feature to have in a small kitchen w limited counter space most other rice cookers do not have a nice flat top has all the normal functions for a variety of types of ricegood design functionality quality at a reasonable price

1707,1,i got this camera as a lighter alternative to my   canon camera but again was disappointed this camera takes terrible pictures in landscape mode even with the landscape scene selected default position is auto no thanksnot recommendedterrible pictures in landscape mode
7280,1,i got the gopro  refurbished and it was a mistake the battery was too swollen to fit into the camera amazon offered me partial refund to buy a new battery so i did after recording something and trying to upload to the computer the camera turns itself off every few seconds so it cant even upload seems like it was returned before but i am not convinced it was actually refurbishednot convinced it was actually refurbished
5959,1,the product was brought for an  year old so we werent looking for anything spectacular however the overall poor quality is disappointing the camera is plastically to the touch  external colour is in fact flat not like the glossy pictures of the product you will see the lense  screen look like something from  years ago  it has a clunky cheap toy like feel the photo quality is dire wasnt expecting them to be great but most look like a drawn by a child in a darkened room even then half the photos dont print properly anyway  and the paper is very expensive too no way is this product worth purchase price you instantly get the feeling youve been ripped off  the product will be in the bin in a couple of months at best avoid 
221,2,contents in the box not accurate missing  sd card and canon carrying case not sure how to contact the seller about this 
2982,1,many of the pictures came out with white lines the initial cardboard piece thats supposed to come out first was stuck so the film wouldnt work we even tried  camerasbad film
2681,1,was really hoping to enjoy this camera but the same day my granddaughter opened it for her birthday the memory card popped out and will not secure back in we currently have a piece of tape over it but it still will not stay and then doesnt allow us to take a picture bc its not registering that the memory card is in the slot would love help in replacing it or getting a refundfaulty memory card
13993,5,i love my rice cooker it has all the important functions and is small and portable i have limited space on my counter and with being less than a square foot this cooker is mighty convenient the only thing i wish it had was a way to steam veggies while cooking the rice im looking around my local goodwill for circular trays that might fit but its going to be tough otherwise its a great machine for the pricesmall and powerful
1595,2,the battery life only lasts for  hour that is not long enough these cameras are no good i got  for family members and  for myself not realizing that they were so bad when you are away you want a camera to work for the time that you are gonebattery doesnt last

14222,5,another great home appliance that i didnt think much of at first as it was able to cook rice in a much better quality than the pressure cooker that i have it also managed to do it much faster than i expected which is a great plus especially when there is not much time to meal prepeasy to use

15639,5,were a family of three and this rice cooker is the perfect size for our rice needs moreover the physical size makes it easy to store and additional rice is easy to accommodate when we have guests previously weve been using a microwaveable rice cooker and the quality of rice that i get out of this rice cooker is a lot better quality  fluffier and less dry  than my current method its also easy to clean wo concern of bpa leaching from the plastic onto our foods when irradiated by microwaves and heat its just as described on the website and i would certainly recommend to othersperfect size and easy to use
1899,1,unfortunately i had the experience of some of the other people on here i bought this as a wedding gift for my sister they brought it on their honeymoon and took their first shot on it it immediately died and they tried replacing the batteries it just doesnt do anything now what i would like to know is does this company send a replacement or refundbroke immediately
3517,1,awful qualitywaste of money
3477,1,definitely cute pictures that have a  vibe but youll get maybe  good pictures out of the pack of  ready to print film pages as the title says unreliable what you see in the frame is not what is going to print cuts off half the pictures top or bottom printing completely out of crop photographs i chopped most peoples heads off of all my pictures on family vacation its a shame because the pictures are stickers if you peel the paper back off could have been a one off maybe mine has a glitch but bottom line i recommend instax brand instant print photosunreliable
9968,4,i bought this to replace my old imusa rice cooker which i loved but finally died after years of dedicated work i figured id splurge a little and get a slightly fancierlooking cooker this one makes decent rice but i am not blown away by it it is certainly more versatile than the imusa i had but it takes almost twice as long for the rice to cook and i actually think the quality of the cooked rice is a little worse than the imusas when i first bought iteven cooking a small amount of rice it almost always comes out either soggy or crusty sometimes both even when the water is measured perfectly with the included cup but i meanit cooks rice and thats all i really need it to doa decent rice cooker
7262,2,got this camera for my boyfriend for christmas camera is obviously used i dont recall seeing that anywhere there are scratches everywhere looks like it was dropped on cement hella times it came in a box for a cup like a drinking cup wtf no handbook or anything so if anything happens were going to have to google what to do not excited to give it to him anymoredisappointed

15467,4,i loved all but could make coconut yogurt so ill make grass fed next i havent tried a cake but love how it cooks soup rice and bone broth just wish it was more cupsthank god he blessed me
1063,1,my motorola razr took better pictures than this thing way back in  waste of money for even beginnershorrid price should be 
1797,1,we got these for our kids for christmas one of them didnt ever work at all and the other just takes terrible pictures i was aware they probably wouldnt take great pictures i grew up in the polaroid era but im talking they were so blurry you couldnt even tell what it was if you hold extremely perfectly still you might get an ok shot and they arent that cheap and replacement film isnt cheap so i do not think these are in any way a good product overpriced garbage really maybe i just got two dudsi dont recommend
3958,2,picture quality not the best stopped working in less than a month not worth it fuji film instax mini 
1701,1,it is extremely difficult to use settings are hard to see and sent with no instructions i am really sick of misleading advertisement i tried to call support but they could not helpapparently they dont have clear instructions either really miss the simple camera dayspiece of junk with no manufacturer on it
12728,5,i have owned countless rice cookers over the years while i loved my zojirushi for the price and the amount of rice we cook i would choose this  times out of  i have cooked  cup all the way up to  cups both uncooked volume and the rice came out flawlessly every time just get it you wont regret your choicethe rice you deserve
14072,5,i mean what is there to say it cooks rice perfectly i have cooked sushi rice and just plain old generic  bulk rice and it has done both types perfect i also used the egg function and it soft boiled them fine the timer does count down in  minute increments so when you first use it you may think it is not working you are looking at  minutes for white rice but it is a set and forget device so that is not a problem in my opinion if you eat rice fairly regularly i typically eat it  or so times a week it is definitely worth havingeasy to use
9478,5,easy to use up tp to  cus uncooked rice in under  min cleaning is a breeze price was right for a person on a strict budget i highly recommend to anyone who wants easy quick rice anytimeyou need to be careful with the center of the rice cooker
8871,1,the camera didnt have the crispness of other camerasdidnt have the crispness of the picture
7519,1,update  months later i was out using the camera i shot some footage set it down picked it back up and it wont turn on no idea whats going on tried charging and switching batteries no go i have also realized with time that the video quality issue is a really crappy lens which isnt really important if the camera cant even last a year this thing sucksi dont know if its the image sensor or the internal compression but the footage is not particularly sharp or vivid its more like iphone  hd i have been using it in  and my cheap point and shoot looks  better even though it only shoots  not thrilled that it isnt rated for any water resistance without the case i deal with a lot of rain and the case cuts off the audiospeaking of audio i didnt expect it to be good but it has some sort of board mounted inside by a single tab i know this because it resonates when you tap it no matter how you grip it from the outside so the slightest wrong movement makes horrible noises on the audiothe image stabilization is pretty crappy but its about on par with other cheap cameras with optical stabilization it is better than nothinglast complaint is that the mounting plate that comes with it is incompatible with the accessories kit that supposedly matches it not that big of a deal you just swap it out for one of the accessory onesnow if i had purchased this expecting a gopro i would have been severely disappointed it would be a  star product but i give it  because i expected less just not this much lessunimpressive
14721,5,the best rice cooker i have ever had worth the moneythe best
4788,1,this camera was delivered on october  and was immediately wrapped for christmas morning and placed in the back of the closet with an amazon  warranty if there was something wrong with the camera we should have been able to still take care of it this was santas gift to my  year old daughter that was opened christmas morning yesterday she was able to take three pictures before it stopped working all the lamps on the brightness adjustment started flashing and the camera would not take a picture according to the instructions there are two reasons for this  low batteries ok i had placed the batteries that came with the camera in it and they may have been old i changed the batteries without with the same results and the lights continuing to blink the instructions state the the other reason  is a more significant issue and i need to contact an authorized fuji film repair centerwell shoot dud camera from the get go no problem right amazon had a  day warranty again nope the return by date was october  and they state that they do not have any further information and i would have to contact the sellerwell shoot again ok i contacted the seller through amazon and they told me that since it shipped through amazon that i needed to contact amazonso now i have a product purchased through amazon that neither amazon nor the supplier will support the  day warranty looks like i may just have to take the loss and let my  year old know that santas gifts suck and mom and dad will have to find her something else that she may like with  being the way it is thats a lot easier said than done now days so my  year old daughter is the real looser in this bad product and even worse customer servicethree pictures and done
5929,1,took two pictures and then the camera turned off wouldnt take the charge for several hours and would never turn back on my kids vacation is ruinedcrap crap crap
2817,2,the picture quality was not at all what i was hoping for most pictures come out grainy and a bit blurry wish i would have kept the box to send it backdoes not have the best picture quality
4159,2,it says   i changed all the settings but still the quality of photo is poor than  cameradescription of the product is false and misleading  
4136,2,this is an ok cheap camera if you just need something to be sent to you quickly before a trip as i did please be aware that the battery life on this camera is horrible it comes with two batteries i made sure to charge each of them to capacity before i left for my trip and they both went dead after one hour not only that they take forever to charge and i am using an apple super charger the age old adage of you get what you pay for rings very true im surprised no other customer has had this same experience and left a review stating such maybe this company is removing negative reviewshas the absolute worst battery life
2829,2,love the size of the camera but when u take the picture if u move at all its fuzzyfuzzy pictures
10947,4,i have had better rice cookers this one is small then i expected that being said for the price it is a good rice cooker easily makes enough rice for my partner and myselfgood but small
2554,1,paper is getting stuck and lot of waste of papernot good
9052,2,the film seems old because all the photos came out looking very washedold film
603,1,save yourself the time and effort the flash is just like the flashlight button on your phone it turns on like a flash light amd does not even light up the photo complete waste of money if you actually want ant light in your photos or want a photo any other time than high noondoes not have an actual flash
15441,5,"i must admit i am old fashioned in a sense traditional pots and pans heat and sweat i was not really in the market for a rice cooker but i figured why not if anything i could give it away if i didnt like itfirst day i wanted something simple to make with minimum effort oatmeal it was measured dash of salt milk and butter done set it for  mins which seemed too short the timer went off and i looked it looked a tad soupy and i thought meh untill i let it sit for  mins it was perfect test after seeing a lady cook pasta on youtube i said why not rigatoni something i have never tried to cook before added the pasta and sauce  cup of chicken broth ground turkey and seasoning there were  timer settings for pasta  mins and  mins i went  because there was no way this all was going to cook in  mins wrong i planned on stiring every  mins and by  mins it was completely done i had to unplug because i misplaced the bookletthis thing is golden and i am certain i will try all sorts of things ive never thought about cooking before next up mango sticky rice do yourself as favor and get thisworks almost to well"
1360,1,if you format the card in windows you will be able to get the files off the card but windows will always give you an error message if you format the card in camera the card will be unreadable usb has been around a long time no excuse for such a bad implementation no manual available and the app doesnt have all the camera functions available you must experiment and find what you need youre supposed to be able to access the sd card via a usb cable but that setting is not the default and its not in the app you have to search through the camera menu to find it with no documentation i guess you can take the camera apart and remove the sd card to download the files but its hard to get to and inconvenient plus the errors you will get if you try if youre trying to do something on a professional level using their software say a nine stop hdr to dng conversion you have to process one pano at a time to get the highest quality the software does not retain the last setting and there is no batch processing for multiple files until they fix all the problems dont bother purchasing this camera i thought it could be useful for some quick panos in tight spaces but turned out to be a total waste of my timebad usb drivers dont buy
10021,5,love love love this great for steaming vegetables at the same time just enough for two people use directions on rice package for amount of water not the machine instructions vegetables for  perfect convenient and easy clean upquality
3503,1,one of the worst cameras i have ever had the misfortune to purchase the photo looks cartoonish the actual snapshot takes a couple seconds and you have no option to review it unless you go into settings the concept is good if it worked way to much money for this its horrible i bought it for my etsy shop and photo taking and videoing items augh i have no idea how the ratings are so high on this camerareturn was easy save original shipping boxawful camera
4158,2,its easy to use and battery life is good but the picture quality is pretty atrocious no way to focus dont even bother trying to photograph anything small or closeup it will just be a blurry messeasy to use but picture quality stinks
10491,4,this size is just what i wanted to make a serving of rice just for myselfits easy and worry free and while its not important its cute perfectly small
3507,2,the picture quality is extremely lacking buttons on the top is so difficult to use if youre more professional photographer then this is not nearly good enough for youbad quality not worth the money
322,2,bought this camera about a year and a half ago i used the camera occasionally last month the zoom stopped workingand the display shows a system error messagerestarted the camara a few timesno changesstill not workingso the warranty from a manufacturer is only  monththat means i have to pay for repairswasnt expecting having issues with this camera after  years 
13722,5,"i absolutely love this rice cooker easy to clean easy to use and easily packable it has a warm setting so when your rice is done cooking it doesnt get cold this is an important feature when looking for a good rice cooker in my opinion make sure to unplug it after use as the weight of the bowl is enough to make it stay on the warm setting without anything in itother than that this rice cooker will likely be traveling with me for many yearsthe last rice cooker youll ever need"
3123,1,the paper photos were damaged after being printed by the polaroid camera i checked and the expiration date was not the problem there were marks in the paperthe paper was damaged
2791,2,this is used about once a week and when you go to use it you can take one picture and then it says the batteries are low again i charge both batteries assuming i can use the other as a backup but when changed out the same thing happens and i get a couple of pictures only on a supposedly fully charged battery that was left to sit a week the quality of the case is pretty cheap plastic and it doesnt really seem that user friendly for a kids camera i wish i could return it but of course i am a couple of days past my return eligible date i wouldnt recommend this even for the  it coststhe batteries keep dying
5275,1,this companys return policy is difficult and very unfair despite sending back every box and every piece of covering the representative told me that i neglected to include a box or something in the return package and therefore theyd deduct  from the refundas for the nikon camera itself i will recommend it to all new users very easy to handle and takes crisp and clean photos in a variety of settingsgreat camera poor distribution company
3076,2,once the sand is in the bags the velcro doesnt lay flat to itself and there are sections where the sand will escapesand comes out
11416,5,works great easy to use fast clean up looks cute on my counter i got the pink oneworks great and its pretty
2432,2,i bought this inexpensive camera to vlog for my social media apps everything on the camera works great except the mic i tried purchasing several ext mics to plug in the camera but none of them worked and i missed the window to exchange or return i use the camera but have to do voiceovers when i record with iti would still recommend that check the mic first as soon as you receive it and make your decision from theregood for videophotos but not recording
7858,1,it prints out discolored photos one i printed looks like theres a yellow film over it and the other is the same but for whatever reason looks like blue film insteadedit taking off a star because the more i use it the more i hate it i cant even use a full pack because once it gets to about halfway through it starts printing wrong and causes white lines at the top where it doesnt print and the colours of the pictures are becoming more and more distortedi was extremely excited for this and am extremely upset about this as im a part time fast food worker and i splurged a bit to get this as a birthday present for myself so im regretting spending money on this i feel like my money could have been spent on something much more worth whileworks i guess updated
8762,1,camera is fine but they did not send me the film that i paid for with the camera also does not give me the option to contact the seller regarding sending me the missing portion of my orderthey do not send the film with the camera like i paid for
6042,2,bought this for my  old nephew birthday even inside the protective case it broke the screen detached and is kind of loose and as of last week we can charge for days and it doesnt turn onbroke in less than  months
8307,1,i bought this for my sons birthday within two hours of him opening it thr camera stopped working it would freeze up as soon as he took a picture then it would flash no card when the sd card was installed the camera would also randomly shut off we are waiting on a replacement camera to arrive i am hoping the first one was a dud im not very confident in this camera at this pointstarted malfunctioning withing hours
295,2,true to many lumix cameras this camera has all kinds of focus problems otherwise this would be quite a camerafocus problems
3925,2,if comes with  in a pack we wasted about  of them because it wasnt working it came out black so i believe that the film is old i would go with another sellerfilm is old
7432,2,i loved how cute it was and the filters were so cute but after u turn it on it did not turn off for me so we returned it what i think about thisby a kid
376,1,worthless piece of junkcracked before we used it
4950,2,shutter is slow no way to adjust takes closeups ok but when you zoom any length camera takes  seconds to focus and sometimes loses focus either you get a blurry pic or your pet has moved and the moments lost they replaced it both cameras were the same not what i expected of a minoltanot worth it
1518,1,i recently purchased this camera for my grandpa hoping to provide him with a userfriendly device for capturing precious moments however im extremely dissatisfied with the overall performance and functionality of this camera the operation is excessively complicated it is not intuitive and even after thoroughly reading the provided instructions were struggled to navigate through the various settings the controls are also not userfriendly making it difficult to capture the desired shots effortlessly the picture quality falls far short of the advertised claims despite the description boasting about the cameras impressive  resolution the actual output doesnt match these specifications the flip screen which should provide convenience for selfportraits or vlogging suffers from a lack of durability and reliability considering the high expectations set by the description and the investment made this camera has been a major letdown that has caused more frustration than joydisappointed with its subpar quality
14291,5,"ive used a few rice cookers here and there but this one blows them all out of the water ive only used it for regular rice quick rice and porridge so far if youre in a hurry you can get the rice cooked in about  minutes on the quick setting and its still better than your average rice cooker if you have some time the  minute rice cycle makes fluffy glorious delicious rice theres also a steamer attachment which is nice and useful and a spoon for the rice or ladle for porridgeif you want porridge congee or jok as they call it it also makes a delicious warm pot you can set it and forget itcleanup is the easiest thing the inner pot lifts out and is nonstick so extremely easy to rinse out the unit even tells time even when unplugged i just love this rice cookerbest rice cooker ive ever used"
7854,2,the pictures come out a little weird i bought this to take pictures for my boyfriend but when i printed them out the color of the picture would be different or like faintedpicture
5922,1,i order two of these and both died after about a day of use and would not hold a charge or turn on do not buy this camera for the one day it was working my kids loved it as it was their big request this year for christmas ughdidnt hold charge after one day
6529,1,didnt survive that many uses already stopped workingjunk already stopped working
5430,1,a few months after buying it im now moving and need to take it down unfortunately the handle unscrewed somehow and now i cant get it off of my desk now what am i supposed to dohorrible quality screws i may need to throw away this whole desk just cause of this one part failinghorrible quality
864,1,i bought this hoping the other reviews were wrong about incorrect amount of film listed nope only  provided even though it stated   boxes scam
1510,1,i returned it as it was damaged on arrival 
9199,1,have tried all the settings and nothing helps images are blurrypoor image quality
7501,1,ok so i really wanted to like this camera but i just cant ive bought cheap  action cameras before and this has the exact same image quality i figured for the price it would have at least a semidecent image sensor but i was wrong this camera in no way shape form or fashion is true  more like  scaled up to  size honestly if youre looking for a cheap action camera buy the  ebay one at least you know what youre gettingto put it in perspective for some reason i still have my old iphone  i got it out and recorded a few videos and it is light years ahead of this thingthe packaging and accessories are pretty decent and the touch screen does work you also get  batteries and a charger that will charge both simultaneouslyif by chance the manufacturer reads these consider thisditch the high dollar packaging remote control random accessories and almost useless touch screen use those savings to put in a better image sensor and youll have trouble keeping them in stock everyone i know who owns and uses action camerasgoproswhatevers doesnt care anything about the package in comes in a tiny screen that you cant manipulate anyway or the cheesy watch sized remote we need a power button a recordstop button and quality video thats it no goofy gimmicksdont even consider it
3180,1,first it should be acknowledged that the product did not come with velcro had the bags come with velcro it is possible that they may have held together better but i wouldnt count on it the bag still ripped immediately at the seams putting that aside if you even can the zippers were so cheap i honestly think they were made of pressed aluminum foil im not kidding they were these tiny little things that bent and broke in my hands before i could even zip the bag closed and then the seams ripped it was as if this bag disintegrated in my hand by magic touch anyway at  its barely even worth this post just try something else particularly if you are using sand which can be messyyou get what you pay for  immediately ripped and broke
1137,1,my motorola phone cost me the same price and has more memory and better photo qualityit is not 
4733,1,this was so cute for the day we got to use it and then it broke cant push any buttons or anything now when it prints it only prints linesbroke after a day
2062,2,i thought this camera would have some way of storing the photos digitally but i guess i was wrong just an instant print camera no digital backup what kind of camera doesnt come with digital backup drive these daysno digital backup
8089,1,the pictures come out dark even in mid day light take forever to developpoor quality photos
7364,1,same as the smaller model poor mount ability can only use for small drawings almost impossible to useneed a lot of patience seller refuses to pay return shipping on a product they stand by dont waste your money you will be discouragedpoor mount ability
7647,2,the film that was supposed to be included with the camera bundle was not in the packagei did not receive the film that was suppose to come with camera
16963,5,this is the cutest rice cooker ever this is a lot more affordable option compare to the other cuckoo models love it i will probably using it for yearslove the sticky rice option
1037,1,is this the trend in digital cameras these days they included a lanyard useless and an extra battery even but no memory card i would have gladly traded the extra battery for a basic memory card thats like buying a printer and not including any inkbeware no memory card included
8770,1,bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday once i gave it to her it has trouble ejecting the cover on the film i bought for it we tried taking a picture and it didnt work and got jammed thought maybe its just a defective pack of film so we tried another and still nothing ended up burning  packs of film before we gave up and contacted support now im outside of the return window on amazon i contacted poloroid and they said they have a  year warranty on all products and that affiliates like amazon and best buy would honor that warranty but ive been getting the run around from amazon because i cant talk to a human being and get this resolved so now im out  and stuck with a plastic paperweightarrived broken and no chance of getting a refund
3826,1,this was a disappointment from the get go i got it for my  year old so i wasnt expecting super quality but even she quickly became uninterested she would rather use an old iphone  for her photographic adventures because the quality in the images from this camera is so terrible it frequently shuts off or crashes it was a waste maybe the  year old will use itnot what we were looking for
9888,5,love it i made some puerto rican rice  with pigeon peas and it did its job i love itlove it
10458,5,i ordered this so i could cook just a small amount of rice at a time it works perfectly and i appreciate that a measuring cup and scooping spoon were included they also have ingredient ratios and some fun recipes in the manual i love how cute it looks sitting on the counter and how small it is when storing under the cabinet it has very simple features making it super easy to use i do wish this had an automatic shut off it will stay warm if it is not unplugged and dry the rice out if you dont add enough liquid otherwise i am very happy with the productso cute and works great
10070,5,not much to say other than it makes good rice instructions for the water to rice ratio can be a little confusing so i just use the one knuckle method add however much rice you want into the metal pot thats included and make sure the rice is flat in the bottom then put your index finger on the rice and pour in water slowly youll know you added the correct amount of water when it reaches your first knuckle on your fingergood product
7517,1,i order overnight the camera akaso  and it came without batteries charger and cord and now i am stuck i need it for today very dissapointedi cant use itcame with no batteries charger or cable
6762,1,do not buydoes not work for any of the cameras
9302,5,this smallmedium rice cooker is perfect the instructions that come with it are easy to understand and its very easy to use and clean definitely worth the price makes enough rice for a family of  with some left overworth the price
8179,1,even with the firmware update this camera keeps freezing on me and im forced to reset it i really did look forward to this product especially with the battery life i dont recommend to buy but if you do decide make sure you test record it first chances are its going to freeze up on you in under  mincamera is unusable keeps freezing
17338,5,"perfect rice every time on the normal setting  but its slow takes about  minutes for a couple of cups of rice great feature to set it to be ready at a specific time like youre having dinner at  pm and want rice to be hot and fresh right then no problem just put in the rice and water in the morning set it for  and press a button dont even have to compute the math like oh well if it takes  minutes then i should start it at  pm and its now  am so i need a delayed start of  cleverthe induction heat is fabulous nice and evenly cooked throughout no crispy bits on the bottom or uneven ricemade congee  porridge in it too and that was perfect shouldve bought this years agosuperb rice but slow"
14092,5,great little rice cooker i bought this as a replacement of my panasonic rice cooker served me well for the the past  years this seems to have all the same smart functionalities and equally well built rice comes out just right its smaller than my old one which is a good thing as it takes less space in the covers the only thing i wish it had was a retractable power cord instead of the standard cord it uses but not a deal breaker or anything im very happy with it over allone of the best rice cookers i have owned
4231,1,not a great camera not quality pictures i got this to take pictures of sunsets scenery and gardens the pictures are very lacking this might be enough for a kid but for an adult i would not recommendnot pleased
14149,5,this rice cooker is perfect for spacelimited kitchens the instructions are simple and it has a bit of variety in its use the overall build quality is decent and its parts are easy to clean the only thing it lacks is a small well for capturing the water that drips down from the lid when the cooker opens there isnt one on this one so i have to wipe the cooker dry each time i open the lidsimple
2559,1,i was really excited to gift this to my niece but after charging the camera would not turn on the screen would light up as i was charging it but as soon as i unplugged it it would not turn on going to be returning and trying a different branddidnt work right out of box
6860,1,this camera wasnt waterproof i should have known when it wasnt expensive i took it to the galapagos islands and it worked for a short time then died and leaked i wish i had spent more money on a decent underwater camera for such a special trip very disappointing especially since it was a polaroiddont buy it
8042,1,i was so excited to get my instax minnie printer and i charged it immediately when it arrived i also had film i had prepurchased however when i try to use the app to print my pictures they come out with only half of the image developed i dont know whats wrong 
7778,1,this product feels like the cheapest chinese plastic junk and it does not charge or work or turn on what a bummer for my daughter thanks for breaking someones heart for their birthday  boopiece of crap does not even charge turn on or work do not buy
10534,5,i appreciated the quality of this smaller rice cooker it is exactly what i needed and works very wellquality
9323,4,"yes its housing is stainless steel it does the job and is very easy to use and clean but for the price its leaving a little to be desired in the lookfeel department the lid is a cheap plastic and it feels a little tacky to usepros very simple to use fast heatingfast results nonstick coating is nontoxic im a bit paranoid about this and im not a biochemist im just going off what the ad says on this point easy to clean even with sticky ricecons not the best quality materials price is high considering the materials useddoes the job"
15522,4,perfect for any use and youll get great rice highquality nonstick surface easy to clean and great value for the priceeasy to use and clean
5858,1,there is no viewfinder so you have to look at the screen before taking pictures and i get better quality pictures from my iphone  plusno viewfinder and same quality pictures as iphone
8088,1,truly awful pictures and the film is remarkably expansive keep searching for a better optiontruly awful
14497,5,i wasnt expecting this so small thoughsize small
309,1,i have only used this camera twice for maybe a couple of hours now the camera will not turn on at all all of the items are what came with the new lumix all panasonic supplied cords charger etc many other the last year or two have had the same issue in attempting to fix my search brought up a lot of videos and reviews stating the same thing the camera just stops and it will not charge not matter what you do even bought a new battery panasonic should return money will never buy a panasonic product againcamera will not turn on same issue as others only used twice bought new
2133,1,i really wanted to like this light boxi got it for my small business to take product pictures however the lights in the box itself were severely lacking they were dim and most importantly there were only two lights one on the left and one in the front this meant the each picture was left with a really odd shadow that was hard to fix even with editing larger objects dont pose as much of a problem but i noticed smaller products such as jewelry were incredibly hard to take pictures ofbut the worst part was the fire hazard whenever i was disassembling the box to put it up i grabbed one side of the box i had it laying on its back to collapse it and burned my fingers i realize that it was because i was feeling the heat of the lights through several layers of fabric plastic and even the flap of the lid that had draped over the lights while i was disassembling nothing was covering the lights while the box was in use though this was after having used it for only  minutes i ended up returning the box because i believe it was defective at first i thought the dim lights resulted from a cheap setup but with the heat coming from the lights im not so surei do not recommendfire hazard
14741,5,"the instructions are a little difficult to sort out but with a little effort and referencing and rereferencing backandforth you should be able to understandthe most common feature which you will use is the rice making capability which features in all in one settingmade some of the best rice ive ever had i am not disappointed at all and feel that for the price a punch is way above its weight class i did lots of research before settling on this one as i felt it balanced out feature versus pricecuckoo is a legendary brand in asia and this does not seem to have any new features that havent already been into practice in the past so i feel confident that this will bring many years of consistent cookingbest rice ive ever eaten"
8759,2,kinda disappointed with the camera even in the light and with flash on it takes dark photosdoesnt take good photos
16960,5,we love our rice cooker it works great and looks beautiful in our kitchenlove it
11238,5,this is a well working inexpensive rice cooker i love itgreat
3186,1,put sand it and it comes pouring out through the velcro maybe rocks would be a better optionthese do not hold sand well at all maybe rocks
3178,1,currently have  cameras on property all less than a year old only  current work on full cell signal and full battery charges bought two of the new flex cameras to try and one failed within  days tried to reach support via online chat and took   hours with    minutes between product specialists responses back would not recommend to anyone spypoint has the absolute worst customer services i have ever experienced and products do not lastworst customer service ever experienced  cameras fail very quickly
8061,1,play video i bought this camera for my trip out of the country and when i unboxed it and loaded the camera with film it kept ejecting photos after the initial test sheet it also kept ejecting multiple photos each time i tried taking a single photo this isnt my first polaroid camera so i know i wasnt putting the cartridges in wrong but i tried with more in case there was something wrong with the cartridge  not the camera unfortunately i ended up wasting three cartridge with no luck solving the problem being as im out of the country for the next couple months i could not get a return label or refund on the defective productdefective item
6577,2,the camera itself does the job but i wish id looked at their app at all before buying given that uploading images quickly and wirelessly to my tablet was my primary intentionsnapbridge nikons wireless image uploading app is insufferable ive downloaded it on multiple identical tablets only to have wildly varying results in whether or not it can connect to its designated camera at any given point it seems to have gotten worse over time as they try to update the app or i would have returned it a few weeks ago while it was still eligible to be returned i have had to spend so much time troubleshooting that damn app that i may as well have bought another camera entirely im pretty disappointed with this purchase overall since im not able to do the only thing the app is designed forcamera fine nikon app unusable together this purchase was a bummer
4173,1,got a defective item will not even chargedidnt even work
17089,4,ive only had this for two days but i thought i would post about my experience so far in case it is helpful to anyone else i had originally processed a return of this item and just cancelled the return i was originally going to return it for two reasons  i did not notice the qas about lead in the enamel and i was very concerned about this we are careful about the cookware we use and it didnt occur to me to check for leadcadmium in the glazing and  i was not able to reach a rolling boil even after it had been set to manual  degrees for two hours which was shocking it was close a bubble or two but not rolling however i cancelled my return and am trying it out again for two reasons  im very happy to report that my le creuset dutch oven fits and works exactly the same in the base and le creuset tests extensively for lead and has been found to be free of lead so even though its a waste to have the instant dutch oven and not use it i wont be using that for cooking maybe i will as a serving container and  i read a review of this product by someone else who said that you have to set the temperature and the timer to something like  minutes rather than  hours in order for the device to reach that temperature quickly  otherwise it will take hours to reach that temp i tried that today  setting it to  at  degrees for  minutes and lo and behold it reached a beautiful rolling boil i never intended to use this as a slow cooker but wanted to use this to make soups or braise stews and then keep them warm so it seems possible now and im going to keep trying to see if it works i hope this is helpful to others who may have concerns about lead or is having trouble reaching a rolling boilthere is a learning curve but so far so good
17675,5,i need individual portion of oatmeal in morning this cooker can make a single cup the white and brown rice results are excellent the coating cleans easily with dish soap and water no scrubbing required the setting for sprouted brown rice is delicious this cooker is easy to use alsoall round excellent appliance
6204,1,i needed a rain cover for my olympus penf camera on my trip to scotland first thing i noticed is there is no way to carry the camera around your neck with the cover on and closed when the clear plastic section gets wet you cant see through it and with just a little dip in the temperature  the whole cover got so stiff that it is impossible to use i didnt even bother bringing it home with me dont waste your money on thisa disappointment all around
7347,1,super difficult to use i spent several hours on several occasions trying to use it a lot of money wasted do not waste your moneybad
1424,1,even if the output really is  the quality itself is so poor that it feels like false advertisementvery poor quality images
1233,1,the pictures and video wasnt clear at allthe quality wasnt good
2805,1,we purchased two of these cameras for our kids on vacation one works exactly as expected and our daughter is enjoying it the other freezes up every few minutes even the power button wont turn it off the screen is often filled up with camera icons and we have to remove the battery to reset it in a similar vein it sometimes wont turn on unless we first remove and reinsert the battery the four year old doesnt tolerate this inconvenience well as you can imagine since were on vacation its a major hassle to return and reorder a new one cant recommend this camera due to the inconsistency in product 
9753,5,"so far this does what its supposed to do ive made rice in it three or four times so far twice i set the timer for it to be ready when i wake up yes rice for breakfast and it worked great but there is a slight learning curve let me explain what i found to work best making rice in this thing it might very well work this way for all rice cookers but this is the only one ive ever owned so i can only speak about this one rule  dont follow the included instruction when it comes to making rice follow the instruction on the rice packaging first then adjust the first batch i make i followed the included instructions and the rice came out so sticky it was like paste the second batch i followed the rice packaging instructions which was similar but less water and it came out a lot better but still a little more sticky than i would have liked so i decreased the water a little more and now it comes out perfect rule  more sticky means too much waterive only made white rice in this so far not sure of the brand but it is an asian branded white rice not jasmine or some other kind of riceupdate living with the  version for two and a half years i loved it so much i went and bought the bigger  version a few days ago because i found out i could steam fish and chicken in these but the  version was too small to fit three pieces of tilapia plus i didnt want to steam fish and cook rice at the same time and get fishy rice i just made my first meal using both of these the smaller i made rice and the bigger i steamed three pieces of fish and it came out great i also made oatmeal for the first time in the smaller one yesterday i was thinking about buying an instapot last week but after reading up on it and watching a few videos i realized i can do the same thing with the aroma and ive very happy with the brand so now i have two my next thing is im going to hard boil some eggs and see how those turn outso far this does what its supposed to do"
8333,1,it gave up after a couple of days we couldnt charge it 
256,2,i had owned the  and liked it very much i upgraded to the  and the video and image quality are still very good the quality of construction is poor i never let it get splashed or any condition a normal camera would not be subjected too i do exclusively use it outdoors and mainly for wildlife after minimal usage the camera was making noises as it focused on video in particular and eventually stopped working i sent it in for repair and actually did expect in this day and age that it would just be replaced it was repaired and worked but still grinding while focusing the on off switch broke off its plastic and i have given up again i can recommend it for video but very poor construction and poor repair after the factnot splashproof or dustproof
12057,5,"this is a great rice cooker it works awesome my parents had one i ended up buying my own and later bought a third for another family member all the same model the oldest one is over  years old and still works just as well as day one i have only used this specific model which is cheaper but i saw the company sells many other more expensive models i imagine they produce incredible ricei cook rice several times a week which always comes out well either brown rice or white rice i also use this model cooker daily for the steamer function because it brings a thin layer of water to boiling within several minutes and cooks vegetables fast make sure to use the steamer basketi have tried using this model to cook other types of food such as meat it works fine for this but much of the fat will come out of the meat and will stick to the pot and the steamer basket and require more vigorous soaping and scrubbing aftergreat rice cooker  steam cooker"
2370,2,some of product was opened when i open the boxthis is open when it arrived
6071,1,after reading all the great reviews i ordered this camera to take pictures for my sons birthday hoping to give the camera and photos for some great memories charged and ready to go after about  pictures it died and definitely killed the gift and great memory ideas sending backdefinite quality issue
6552,1,piece of garbage absolute junk now that being said it takes great pictures it has awesome features i love that i can use my phone to work the camera the software is a bit glitchy it may take two times to get it to syncwhy do i hate it i put the batteries it came with into it i messed around with it for a good bit i even took a few pictures i then put it away after turning it off i took it back out a couple months later the batteries were really dead what fine i put energizer lithium batteries in it you could run a tesla off those things it turned on i said fine i took the batteries out and put them in a bag with the camera last week i wanted to use it i reinstalled the batteries it said full batteries i tried to take a movie and couldnt figure it out even after a few tries i also couldnt make sure it was on the  sd card i deleted all of the pictures and it got more room it has got to be on the internal memory since it says i can do  min of movie or  pictures anyway i gave up and shut it off i didnt need it for an hour i found out not to put it in what looks like movie mode on the top wheel keep it in auto and just hit record so got it set up turned it on aimed and zoomed ready set record dead batteries ahhh i checked them     sure one is low no clue how that happened it should still turn on because the total voltage is  regular batteries like the ones that came with it maybe  if you are lucky normally    total i have never used it for an actual purpose other than trying out featuresi am half tempted to throw it away
8723,2,this thing is cute but its not leather not even close its completely plastic looking and feeling if it had been real leather as it says it would have been great or if the description listed the actual material it would have been fine too and i would not have gotten it as it is we have no use for itnot leather as description says
2400,2,bought this for my  year old niece and she loves it my biggest question is why is a camera catered for children including a delete all option in the gallery truly poor decision making and really easy for a child to do on accident should be fixedget rid of delete all option
7595,1,i just got this today and it has refused to turn on i got  led lights but  stand instead of  stands and the lights wont come oni am extremely dissapointeddid not turn on
14123,2,i tried my rice cooker tonight here is my review i started my rice and then as soon as the steam began my counter was covered with watery starch from it spitting out of the cooker if i was asked would i buy this cooker i would say no im just not happy with this productit spits out all over
17344,5,my last rice cooker was also a zojirush and it lasted me almost  years thats an absolutely insane life span however my old cooker would no longer let me keep warm rice more than a day it would automatically burn after a day so i decided it was time for a new one im just a single person so this  cup device is more than enough for me i really like the new induction cooking if you decide to get a new zojirush rice cooker i highly recommend you get one of the induction cookers it makes things a lot better i have no doubt that this device will last me a very long time i like cooking either calrose or jasmine white rice in it one of my favorite features is that there is a normal cooking mode but there is also an option for a quick cooking mode if youre in a hurry and you dont have a long time to wait for the rice to cook this is really handy in some situations i have also tried brown rice in it and it came out well too if you need or want a rice cooker that will make some amazing rice and then let you keep it warm for several days then this is the cooker for you i just picked up a  pound pack of rice just in case of any emergencies that will last me a really really long time i dont think ill be buying rice anytime soon  pick yourself up a zojirush induction rice cooker these are definitely the highest quality and most sought after rice cookers if you want that authentic asian cooked rice taste i hope you enjoy it it now i have rice almost always available in case i get hungry a great quick meal is to scramble some eggs and mix it with rice and a little salt and pepper and you have a delicious and healthy extremely quick meali love zojirush rice cookers
4200,1,i bought this to replace the old  which has been with me for  years to my surprise the new one is way worse no mode control the plastic and quality is bad very disappointed i returned it the case is the worst dont get itit retrograded
9685,5,exactly what you pay for works well and makes rice consistently the only problem is that the instructions given are kind of off and you might have some water boiling overcoming through the top if you follow themget what you pay for rice maker
72,2,my  year old loved the camera at first and it was really easy for him to use unfortunately it just stopped turning on after  days we ordered a replacement assuming it was a dud but the new one just freezes sometimes its cheap so im not expecting miracles but at this point wish we had just done a disposable cameraunreliable and breaks easily
8779,2,i was hoping it was like a vintage camera and it wasnt so was very disappointing and the pictures were too small and didnt come out goodpictures didnt come out good and two small
3051,2,says it was for  and it was really smallit came with a low battery
795,1,this camara card will not read once in the camarano working

4168,2,this was underwhelming at best the light didnt get very bright even after a full charge and cranking up the settings returneddull  not bright enough for photos
3500,1,i was sooooo happy and excited to purchase this camera as i did so as a birthday gift to myselfi received it today and as soon as i opened it i noticed the camera lens is cracked and also the camera screen as seen in the photos i immediately request a refund and its in the process of being returned im so upset and disappointed to tears i was really looking forward to enjoying this product i will come back here to let you all know how this matter is being handled and when i received my refundcracked screen and lens
17269,5,i use this to cook both white and brown rice it has a button for each i make  cups dry at a time and use the amount of water specified in the instructions load the grains push the apropriate button and walk away the machine automatically calculates cooking times based on the amount of rice added pretty cool clean up has not been a problem as i dont overload the cookersmall footprint cooks  cups dry rice
10082,5,this rice cooker is one of the best purchases ive ever made i use it multiple times a day for my oats in the morning and either brown rice or quinoa in the afternoon you just set it and forget it and its usually ready in about  minutes the steamer part is a nice touch although i havent used it yet maybe ill try it today haha its easy to clean it works well and has withstood heavy usage so far would buy again for sureone of the best purchases ive ever made
1433,1,very cheap very plastic and light bad bad picture quality i bought it for my little boy for a first camera and even for him it wasnt worth itbasically you get less than what you pay foralso it takes three batteries on top of having to be charged and doesnt come with a sim cardvery very cheap and not worth the price
13789,4,once you get use to setting up the unit to cook it does a great job the rice comes up perfectoperation
1841,2,the camera works but there have been several times where the red light blinks rapidly and i am unable to take a picture after turning it off and on multiple times itll finally functionbut its annoying when im trying to get a shot at a certain moment i had an older version of the instax mini and it worked way better than this also the quality was betterworks but can be finnicky
6152,2,i thought the image quality would be bettersubpar image quality
1942,1,im buy this camera to my first babyi used to take photo for him and me and my husband from the moment his birth in the hospital to remember this memory in the futureawesome camera
6839,2,it is very difficult to use after you take the picture you can not replay your movies on it to see what it is the picture quality has been better on my toddlers cameraterrible camera
3696,2,i couldnt even tell they were turned on the light isnt bright and doesnt help wash a scene at all the plastic covers that are supposed to change the light didnt make any difference i think mine had to be defective or the unit is just low qualityreturned these
3568,1, the camera is perfect but it came with a broken or cracked cover on one sideit is supposed that if it is new it should not come like thiscame with a cracked lid 
2269,2,i dont like the camera it was very small and the quality not good i refund itvery basic camera
8464,2,it worked for about  months then after that it would not let me take any photos it gives me an e where the photo counter normally is ive tried a reset by holding power and shutter button ive tried removing and recharging battery ive tried a new roll of film which ejects the first cover correctly when i do that nothing is helping i basically have a dud and no way to get it replaced since its past the return date i have heard others have this problem and have to get it returned or repairedupdate so i contacted fuji films support department and they told me to ship the camera in with a description of the issue and a copy of the purchase order amazon order screen they took about  weeks shipped me a new one and gave me a replacement cartridge of film if you encounter the e issue and are within warranty one year of purchase you may be able to do the same thing still frustrating that this error seems to be fairly common thoughbeware the e error issue
9482,5,its so easy to use and the rice comes out perfect every single time my  year old can even make her own rice with itsuper convenient
17404,5,"my family raised me on rice its a daily necessity in their home upgraded my folks to this bad boy my folks are hesitant about spending lots of money where its not needed their  rice cooker theyve been using for years  click done i get it but when i made this first batch of koshihikari it came out perfect top to bottom on  cups i then got brave and tried making gaba brown for thr first time in my life gave some to my aunt her husband is japanese he said whered you learn how to make this its perfect lol wound up buying myself a i know  bills is a lot of money but if rice is your everyday its like investing in nice pillows and bed why skimp out if its going to be apart of your everyday lifegot this on a recommendation from professional chef friends some of them have had their zojis for  yearsif you read the instructions carefully tells you to clean the top after each use the part that people are experiencing rusting and showing pix of ive put  batches of rice thru i so far working like a champwarranty says its covered for  years with receipt  manufacturer defect as long as you have the receipt had a friend who had issues with her machine and were taken care of no problem cant speak for the people who cant get service and having issues with their warranty but i guess we will see if mine breaks for now this stays at  star for melittle rice beast"

4884,1,they sent me a defective camera the setting would not switch to any other setting except for home that was enough for me received today shipping back for a refund today i do not reccomend the product or funtech dont waste your time or money on a replacement because a lot of reviewers got screwed if i get my refund ill consider adding a starupdate i got my refund however it states in the email that the reason for my refund is because the shipping address is undeliverable get real seriously funtech sends out defective items that is the reason for the refund zero starsthey sent a defective camera
3821,1,i purchased this camera for my granddaughter to go to camp and take pictures of her experience first time away from home and lots of things to experience and do however the camera was minimally charged took a few pictures and then died i have tried charging it even purchased a new charging cable to see if that was the issue and nothing would not recommendwont charge so i dont know how it works
35,5,this charging pad is great glad i tried despite the reviews idk if maybe they didnt know how to use it but it it easily the best one ive used and for the price you really cant beat itit works
7685,2,wanna be the cool mom then buy this toy now everyone gets so impressed by this little thing im honestly jealous they didnt have any of these when i was growing up i get to relive a piece of my childhood with this toy since snap and go cameras are a thing of the past there is so much film that included and charging with a stranded usb is so convenient  i was communicating with the vendor on ig and they misleading me into purchasing this item im not made of moneyjust the coolest toy ever but vendor misleading
3959,1,weve had issues ever since we purchased this for my daughter currently the polaroid film became stuck as it was ejecting other issues include very sensitive over exposed photos most of my daughters photos dont come out also the number of polaroids indicated on the camera isnt always what is actually left in the cartridgei wish i didnt waste my money on this giftwaste of money

5904,2,i purchased two of these cameras for our fraternal twin grandchildren so they could document their summer visit the printing was sub par with horizontal lines running through the prints the colorwhite balance also seemed offgreat idea not so great printing
2826,1,not kid friendly at all and resolution is awful even for a kids camera certainly couldnt ever print them better off giving your child an old phone you no longer use and having himher use it as a cameraterrible for kids
3651,1,the photo quality isnt as good as an older model i had but its still fun and easy to useedit gave it some time and tried again the worst photos will have to buy a different model disappointingnot the best photos
5145,1,not what i was expecting very hard to get to learn the pictures are the worst ive ever seen just cant seem to find a balancenope never buy

6895,1,its not worth the price or the purchase it should of been set up at least come with the card to go in itdont spend your money
14800,4,great rice cooker so high tech still dont really know how to use but it cooks my rice perfectlyrice
13426,4,"i decided to buy this because i really suck at making brown rice white rice any variety im a champ but i decided i wanted to get more fiber and eat healthier and thought eating more brown rice sounded like a good idea but cooking it on the stove ive had mixed luck when youre cooking something for almost an hour on the stove there are a lot of variables that can mess up your cook this for x minutes recipei bought this because i wanted something small and relatively inexpensive and importantly foolproof i did some research on how rice cookers work basically they boil at water at   f and then wait for the water to evaporate enough to get past that temperature once its just barely past boiling which it wont get until enough of the water is absorbedevaporated then the rice in theory should be donethe first batch of white rice i made i did the exact measurements in the manual for  cup of dry rice i used jasmine it was honestly perfect better than any stove rice ive managed to make which surprised me because i thought white rice on the stove was pretty easyfoolprooftoday i decided to try brown rice since its not just a trial run im actually making food for my family i decided to do  cups of brown rice and the water the booklet called for  l i think the instructions said because the book didnt do a great job of explaining whether you put the water in up to the level on the bowl first i went and looked at the zojirushi website where it said to put the water in then the rinsed rice so i did just that everything looked good and i turned the machine on after about  minutes so much water and steam started coming out of the machine i had to put a paper towel on top so that my counter wouldnt get all covered in water when that got soaked after a couple of minutes i did another when that got soaked i had to pull out a shamwow style of towel and a sponge to catch any overflow picture shown after i pulled the towel off so you can see the steamwater coming out after about  minutes of that the water boiling subsided to just enough that the towel and sponge were no longer neededhoping the rice is worth the trouble in the future if you eat more than a few servings of rice in your family you might want to get a slightly larger rice cooker since its just me my husband and my son we really dont need the full two dry cups to whatever cooked amount that  cups so i think well be fine just doing the one dry cup hopefully this helps someonenot really good for more than one cup of brown rice"
8491,1,ive had this for a little over a year and only used it like  when i pulled it out to snap some photos during this holiday season i went to take a picture and no film came out and then i got the e reading on the back i tried charging the battery and it was no help today after charging the battery and trying to turn it on i am not getting a noise like something is jammed when i when to take the film out having  films left meaning  gone to waste it was jammed and is now making a noise when i try to turn it on this sucks im very disappointed to have paid this much for a defective product being that it is christmas the offices arent open until tomorrow so i am left with no holiday polaroids this year and how convenient it decided to bust on me days after the warranty expirederror message
3024,1,gifted this to my cousin for her birthday embarrassing she told me it didnt work we tried so many times not recommendnot recommend
9152,1,quality was pretty bad for the priceunderwhelming
5137,2,nothing was working as they described i cant recommended this one to anyonethe quality of the video is not that one they say on description
170,1,had to return this item twice now because of defects and camera not working properly i would advise to buy elsewherehad to return twice
7862,1,i bought this to print happy memories and stuff so i could keep the most special fotos but they dont feel very special when only half the picture come out i have the app that im supposed to use and it looks perfectly fine on there but when it actually prints it cut half the picture off and leave the top blank its really frustrating since ive tried to do it again and tried different things to make it works but it just dont each paper costs and now i have five useless papers with half a good memory on plus it gives a weird yellow or purple color over the picture too so the picture i want doesnt look the sameit only prints half the picture
3994,1,camera did not turn on bought new batteries and still didnt work bought another one from walmart and it worked finecamera would not turn on
2153,2,so  amazonbasics really needs to offer a replacement background on this product the black rod that clips the background into place leaves marks that cannot be removed for example if you have the background rolled up with the rod inside and you pick up that roll the rod slides out and leave massive black marks that are there forever ive tried spot cleaning dish soap mr clean magic eraser and finally soft scrub with bleach the marks are there forever and have to be photoshopped out not a fan of having to use a custom solution here the whole point is to look professional and minimize postedits the backdrop provided fits perfectly and clips into place but why have it if it gets ruined in a heartbeat i would gladly buy a replacement and even a black background option for    if it the perfect size and clips into place like the one that comes with it fix it amazon basicsok  but really need a replacement background
521,1,didnt work complete garbage returned the item i was very disappointed it was a christmas gift for my mothercomplete garbage returned the item

2059,2,i bought this camera hoping i could take it on the road travelling with me this summer once i tried it out however i found that the battery only lasts around thirty minutes definately not long enough for a travel camerashort battery life

7357,1,i am so disappointed in thisi cannot seem to get the size or detail that i was hoping fori have tried distancing the device from the paper to make my drawing bigger but it doesnt worki was really looking forward to this arriving but it sits on a shelf looking at me whilst i have returned to fighting with graphs and tracinguseless
1908,1,this camera was a christmas gift for my  yr old takes useless terrible pictures not worth the money at all over exposes every pictureover exposes every picture no matter what you try
6240,2,the clear plastic view square on this is terrible after  uses in weather it became cloudy and no amount of cleaning it will cure it stayed cloudy afterwards the bottom wants to reopen all the time allowing your hands to get wet the drawstring does not secure tightly to the lens causing it to ride up on the lens body due to the stiffness of the materialthe material its made of is a bit stiff 
5272,1,i wouldnt buy another nikon product again this has so many issues with the auto focus and manual focus i tried everything to fix the issue and it is now and has been for the past  years a  paper weight if i could get this issue fixed or a brand new camera with the assurance that it will work for over a month than i may consider using nikon products total disappointment and waste of moneycant focus to save its life
5779,2,as you can see in the pictures the macros with flash is defective after researching extensively online it took an actual phone call to canon to learn that this particular model has an engineering problem that prevents any macros photos to be taken with a flash without the shadow of the pop out lens being in the way of the shot im not an engineer but even i can see that the lens is too far out to not show a shadow in addition the macros flower control is missing in this model making even pictures without a flash controlled by the auto mode and not being able to focus by not providing the macros function present in previous models since about  of my photography is macros this camera is basically useless returning for refunddefective macros system see pics
9563,5,i got this for college and its so small i could storage above the closet in my dorm room also it doesnt take up space when i do use it and my roommate didnt mind it because it was so small definitely let your rice soak for a bit before using it so the rice cooks all the waydorm room approved

4470,2,i immediately returned this item for  it is simply way overpriced you get a microfiber cloth some cleaning implements and some cleaning liquid if this were  i would be singing its praises but at  it is simply not worth itpoor value poor quality

966,1,the reviews seemed promising i bought this for my business to take better quality content for marketing the camera is no better than a cheap webcam i didnt have high expectations due to the price but i still was disappointed i am returning this product not sure how the reviews are so highnot worth it
10515,5,works well for small amountseasy to useeasy clean up and reduces waste important to rinse rice first per the instructions does bubble over a little so we use with a flat plastic dish under it while cooking use all the time to avoid having leftover rice really like this small cookerconvenient
5093,1,never  pixels sensorit is a false description im a professional photographer and the image has terrible quality the image is all pixelated they got a small image and converted to be big so its seemed be  not  with only  the sensor is less than a  pixelthe camera is cute but im mad because it is a false description i bought  cameras and i gave  to a friends kids and one for my  years old daughter they loved but when i downloaded the images to my computer was a big disappointment not for print at all this is for play onlynever  its false the image is like  or less
2953,2,this happened like twice already on one of the  so id expect this to happen again its just a little annoying because of the price ive paid for this more than a dollar a pic pretty much on top of the fact that the quality itself isnt up to par compared to the film my camera came with this film is just bleak the photos arent that filled with colori expected moresome of the film came damaged ie i would take a picture and a blank would come out
2018,1,it doesnt matter if you refrigerate film develop it in complete darkness i have two of these cameras one at work and one at home both awful i miss the olden days one batteries and allawful film quality
4095,1,please dont buy this product until you read many many reviews in detail on amazon and elsewhere online also read and understand the common questions from users and still are going to accept being repeatedly disappointed by the product i am not going to go into full detail as so many others have already i just want to warn people to purchase with much much cautionthe bottom line is after a ridiculous amount of researching i purchased this product i felt i had realistic expectations and hoped mistakenly that the many good reviews outweighed the bad ones however within days i started realizing the system limitations theyre well documented and i should have assumed id have many of the same issues but in short things id call essentially guaranteed frustrations include  the lag time  the heatbased motion sensing shortcomings  the persistent false alarms  the softwares general buggynessheres how i suspect many users first months with arlo will unfold within days of installation you start seeing some of the minor problems false alarms lag modes not working consistently etc and begin to question your decision to purchase this product you spend way too much time trying to dial in the system just perfectly there are a lot of customization options for what thats worth but then you realize some functions just wont work as well as you had originally hoped within a few weeks you settle into a comfort zone where you convince yourself that arlo is not that bad and it still has some value as a simple monitoring system but then you experience your first angerinducing problem system completely nonresponsive when youre away perhaps cant reset remotely or maybe the batteries go from  to dead in an hour i could go on then you spend some time with customer service and more debugging all the while experiencing those same lesssevere system limitations that make the system not all that useful meanwhile you get email and txt alerts regularly and come to start ignoring them finally you decide to return the system there is a warranty and some of my systems issues are covered and customer service informs you they will simply replace the faulty equipment inevitably a camera problem in their opinion not the whole system so the cycle continues finally you decide the best you can do is warn others and hopefully reduce the overall level of frustration in the community of potential users do yourself a favor and find another option arlo is a disappointmenthaving doubts about purchasing trust your gut i wish i had this is not a good system
8674,1,this camera only worked for about  minutes on vacation then wouldnt even turn on again even after the batteries were changedterrible quality
8505,1,bought this as a gift a month ago gave it to my mother during a trip to wdw last week after nine photos the camera stopped working hadnt been dropped or roughly handled the display shows an e code and wont allow any photos to be taken recharged the battery and replaced the film cartridge and still wouldnt work finally tracked down the fujifilm customer support number  and talked to a tech there she said to remove the battery for  hours and the camera would reset to its defaults she also said that she didnt know if reset would fix the problem tried the techs guidance and at first it looked like it worked again since the e didnt show immediately tried to take a picture and nothing happened except the e reappeared unfortunately im one day past my amazon return window for this thing so i guess i send it in to fujifilm to see if they can repairstopped working after  photos  e code
5577,1,the camera was working fine and took nice polaroid photos until the yellow status light started blinking after  month of use tried replacing the film and batteries with no luck the manual says blinking yellow lights means it malfunctioned but which part is totally for you to figure out this camera would have been great if it didnt break so easilystopped working after a month
5066,2,i take better pictures with my phonecamera really isnt very good
4378,2,i bought this frame because i had one simple requirement play a slideshow from a shared folder on my local network this folder has roughly  photos in it and growing i tried everything i could think of to get this to work and it failed miserably after  days of banging my head against the wall i was forced to return it below is everything i tried and how much success i had with each  dlna media server worked okay as long as i limited the number of photos to something small like  anything more than that and the ui would completely lock up for minutes at a time just to time out and do  samba share this showed a lot of promise however when you mount the share it downloads all the photos to local storage instead of just into cache so the internal storage filled up immediately leaving  of my photo collection not included in the  rss feed wrote a script to dynamically generate an rss feed of all my photos and hosted it and the photos on a local web server this also showed promise except again the stupid thing just started downloading all the photos to its local storage why not just load the photo in cache and when the next photo in the slideshow loads delete the photo from cache  onedrive integration my entire photo collection is backed up to onedrive so i attempted to use the pixstar website to sync it with the photo frame this worked alright for small folders but clicking on a large folder thousands of photos the web page just spun and spun forever i got impatient after a few minutes and scrapped this idea tooso there ya go if you are technical and have a large photo collection youll likely have better luck going with a dyi solution like a raspberry pi or tabletdoes not handle large photo libraries at all
12859,5,im a year in and i havent had any issues with it sturdy good craftsmanship i also have a hot pot from cosori i think they just make good stuffits been a year i still love it
8321,1,the screen went black after  minutes of using itthe worst
17449,5,"i waited  months before writing this review as i wanted to be sure i used it multiple times i use this rice cooker mainly for brown rice and sometimes for white it makes perfect rice every time for me the biggest benefit is that i can make the rice ahead of time and i dont worry if it is done before the rest of the meal is ready in the past i was always trying to time the rice to be done with my cheaper rice cooker that never worked and i found myself either waiting for the rice to be done while the other food got cold or having the rice done too quickly and having to microwave it so it was warm when put on the table with this rice cooker i never have that issue  simply fluff the rice when its done close the lid and it stays warm and tastes the same weather i take it right out or wait an houralso no more issues with the right amount of water and type of rice this takes all the guess work out of making perfect rice every time and it never bubbles over like my cheaper rice maker did its also super easy to clean finally it does take a long time to make brown rice in it  but i dont mind as i would rather have great tasting perfectly cooked rice all the timeperfect rice every time"
7322,1,i just got my gopro  not knowing the sd card is not in it now i have to order a sd card to use the camera when i dont know anything about sd cards   extra and  to  days before i can use the cameranot knowing
16258,5,so easy to usewould not be without it
14170,5,bears easytouse brand its convenient to stew meat and cook rice 
9965,2,"i had a basic rice cooker before this one it was simpler to use and easy to cleani was also somewhat disappointed at how much smaller this unit is as compared to my old rice cooker  but i have to accept responsibility for that on my own  i didnt look very deep into that aspect of it prior to purchase i merely assumed that they were all about the same size as i had never seen one this small it will probably be adequate for my needs howeverperformance wise the unit did cook rice just fine although it did take quite a bit longer to do so than my old rice cooker didthe other disappointing thing about this unit for me is that the lid is not washable this lid is a hinged affair that is part of the outer housing so all you can do is wipe it down with a washcloth  sponge i was used to the older type of rice cooler where the lid is a simple lid and the whole inner pot  lid go in the dishwasherfunctional but a little disappointing"
12107,5,its expensive but its fantastic not much more to say the real question is whether you value rice to this price pointgreat rice cooker
9120,1,i was sent old film the photos wouldnt completely develop the date on the film was imprinted more than  months agoi received old film that would not correctly develop
2251,1,very cheap looking and cheap qualitywaste of money
817,1,i was very disappointed that it didnt work as it was a gift for someonethe camera did not work it needs to be returned
445,2,this camera would be okay if it wasnt for the fact that my battery is never sufficiently charged be it a battery issue or a charger issue it is not good when im outdoors trying to photography wildlife and the battery drops so quickly i will say the photo quality isnt terrible but be aware this camera is very loudcharger doesnt fully charge battery
7205,1,does not work well with sony  with vertical gripnot for sony 
2349,1,it broke after a month of usevery disappointing 
2705,2,kept freezing then wouldnt register the sim card to keep the pictures on  returned itemkept freezing
7080,1,firstly it wont use any zink paper except for kodak paper all zink paper kodak or otherwise is manufactured by zink holdings the camera is capable of printing the other brands but kodak locks it out so you can only print kodak branded zink paper this is a problem if you just bought  sheets of canon paper at walmart because you didnt want to wait a week for kodak paper to be mailed to yousecondly its a bad camera when you press the shutter its sometimes several seconds before it actually snaps a picture so more often than not i get a picture of my foot instead the thing i wanted to get good luck capturing any action shotsthe editing features on the touch screen are difficult to use at best theres no dragging or mutitouch so your left clicking buttons for scrolling and croppingin the end i wound up using my phone to take and edit pictures before printing them on the kodak step touch but that has its problems also if you crop your picture to  to fit the format the printer crops a little bit inside your picture so anything close to the edge is lost best to keep that in mindits really a shame i associate the kodak brand with quality and its just not thereok printer bad camera
12194,5,i use it all the time and love it rice comes out perfect every timegreat rice cooker
6469,1,update im downgrading this light frm  stars to  star due to the fact that it broke down after  hour of use i simple cant recommend this light in good faiththis is a really nice soft led light i use it mostly as a fill light and it can be used as a key light under certain conditionshowever theres one big problem with this light it wont turn on while charging by usb cable this becomes a major problem because it means you can only use the light while its charged then you have to wait several hours for the batter to charge again other rechargeable lights operate while charging but not this onein my case i discovered this anomaly a couple of months after i purchased it so i was unable to return iton the plus side the light is very light in weight and its very easy to carry for video shoots it can be mounted even on a small bendable tripod and it did perform the way i was expecting as a fill light the problem again is you cant use it while charging the maker of the light should really say that in the description of the product because if a filmmaker buys this light thinking hell be able to use it with a power bank or plugging it to the wall it just wont happenthus i have to give this light  stars it works well as a portable light but not being able to use it while it charges is a major problem that renders the light useless most of the timeit wont turn on while charging by usb cable and broke down after one hour
4598,1,it broke within two daysit broke
2360,1,this camera worked for  weeks then it broke i couldnt return it because it was too late first off the quality of the pictures are not great it seems to work better the closer you are to the subject and not for capturing landscapes i like the vintage quality it gives but sometimes the images are just too dark or overwhelmingly too light wouldnt buy againlow quality
9112,1,i would have given this  stars if possible  both packages had many faulty pictures they took pictures and sent our blank photos  these are not cheap  very upset with this producthorrible
12710,5,i love kitchen appliances that can be used for multiple purposes this appliance gets an a super easy to use and is so much more than a mere rice cooker it even provides options to select the texture of the rice oatmeal and other grains that it cooks to perfectionmakes rice oatmeal and more
3830,1,trying to be frugal i purchased this camera for my daughters  birthday you get what you pay for not only does it not work unless it stays plugged in the lens didnt expand i wasnt purchasing another battery either my daughter noticed several reviews complaining of the same issue with the battery dont bother i returned promptly i put the money on another reliable cameragarbage
8221,2,very good picture quality but having problems with the unit at times i cant switch off the record the only way i can switch it off is using the reset pin 
16974,4,simple to use cooks quicklyeasy to use  works great
3631,2,when it works its great  i love that i have quick print photos for memorable events but there are times when it doesnt work at all it runs the batteries out very quickly doesnt take the photo at all and a light just flashes or if it takes the picture the photograph comes out white so its wasted film i really wanted to love this but its been such a disappointmentdoesnt work half the time
8076,1,terrible picture quality  after full exposure all photos are dark and dull and muddy looking  not even worth keeping the pictures because they are all unclearterrible picture qualitywaste of money
8589,1,the light triggered very easily and started coming on spontaneously then about a month later it stopped working wont buy an avmp againstopped working about  months of using it
12891,2,"i bought this rice cooker and surprise that it takes very long to cook white rice and brown ricefor  cuplong grain white rice it takes  to  minsjasmine whit rice takes brown rice for  cups takes  minsit takes a very long time to cook rice not fasttake really long time to cook rice"
17167,5,i always cooked my rice on the stove and thought it was pretty good   until i got this rice cooker now my rice is fabulous i also cooked some quinoa in it and it was terrific it takes some trial and error in terms of how much water things need in this pot but that is fine i am writing this after having it for  years and it still works great i highly recommend i hardly ever write reviews though i should but feel so strongly about this pot that i thought i would help others outgreat rice cooker
12059,5,"i will never cook rice another way i have never been able to cook rice properly ive used countless different recipes on the stove and use different cheap  rice cookers and it always comes out uneven and crunchythis rice cooker cooks perfectly every single time it also has an automatic warming function which is great since i have a  month old baby and most of the time i glcant get to it right when it finishes cooking its just as good after sitting in the warmer for an hour as when it first comes out the cord even retracts unto itself for easy storage and it comes with a rice spatula and holder for the side of the cookerill never buy another kind of rice cooker and ill never make rice without it from now onperfect rice every single time"
8926,1,camera worked for about  days lens would not extend called the seller who said he didnt do warranty he gave me an  number which i called was advised they didnt do repair work either was given yet another  number no one ever answered camera began working again for about  weeks lens issue began again very frustrated because i have spent a lot of money on this camera and have not been able to get help with factory warrantyservicecamera doesnt work
14834,4,this is a must have if you cook rice all you have to do is follow the measurement guide in the instructions and let it cook it takes about  minutes to cook about  cups of rice and it comes out perfect literally restaurant quality i do wish the inner piece was easier to clean i put it in the dishwasher once and it ruined it just a bit but it still works greatgame changer
7714,2,i thought this would be a perfect xmas gift for my son but the pour quality in pictures and video made him lose interest real quick maybe a lower grade goproish camera would be betterits durable and thats pretty much it
10009,5,"the rice is excellent and cleanup isnt too difficult you cannot see through the lid and it is not detachable that makes it a little harder if you want to see the progress of your rice and a little tougher to clean if it boils over or spillsthe inner pot on this model also seems quite robust and easy to clean i expect it to last a long time as long as only plastic and wooden utensils are used to scoop out the riceoverall im impressed at the quality of white and brown rice for the price it doesnt have all the bells and whistles of the  models but im not sure most people would need thoseexcellent rice price and nice to clean"
15394,5,we use this once a day at least i love it so muchhow did i live without a rice cooker
14183,5,it is useful and rice is finevery good and nicely
17612,5,easy to use and clean love iteasy to use and clean
2188,2,this was supposed to be a replacement to our old amazon basics light box that we purchased a few years ago the first one arrived without a backdrop and it seemed as if it was used before so i sent it back the replacement came in today and it looks terrible looks of poor quality nothing like the original one we purchased a few years back the box felt flimsy and the materials felt cheap seems as whoever assembled these didnt really care what the end product was as you can see in my pictures uneven cuts and damaged all around sending this one backpoorly made uneven backdrop
900,2,this was a christmas gift for teenage granddaughter totally unhappy with it difficult to use and the video and picture quality is not good at allvery disappointed
4758,1,the light was working great until it wasnthad it as a key light on my dslr and mobile shotsbut then it just cut out and stopped workingeven when plugged into the chargerthe battery never really had the best lengthbut the worst part is the email they list on their customer support page here on amazon is a dead end and isnt validcut out after a couple months zero support or warranty
14443,5,i previously had an aroma rice cooker it would only keep rice warm for  hours and always dried it out ive used this one for over two weeks now and this one will keep it warm for over a day and the texture is still great so happy with this purchase i hope it lasts me for a long timelove love love
8662,1,within the first couple of hours the new batteries were dead and the camera kept shutting off thought it was strange so we put in two more new batteries i noticed within  minutes that the battery life was already down to half not sure what can cause this but we sent it back and got a refundnot a quality product
12247,5,its literally the best its super easy to use and has a pretty standard  cook time for rice always consistent and perfect couldnt recommend this morewhy didnt i buy this sooner
8584,1,i couldnt get the camera to work light would come on but i could not get any video nor sound i returned this and bought a logitech which worked from the beginning i work in the it field and no nothing i tried worked logitech was also three times more but it worksdidnt work

14724,4,"i eat a lot of rice steelcut oatmeal and grits aka polenta i had cooked these successfully up until now in my beloved  zavor multicooker but using such a big appliance is overkill to cook just a cup of dry rice or grains for a few servings in a single household i chose this cuckoo micom microcomputerized rice cooker for its reputation and brand loyalty great reviews on cnn size and multiple cooking functions plus it really looks cute on my counterthis  unit is perfect for me and doesnt take up too much space on my counter it works well and i like the way it cooks rice but the instruction manual with bad english translations isnt always helpful and exactly how userfriendly is the menu setting named glutinous for the usa market i had to search the internet for the best ways to cook my favorite rices grains and porridges in this device but there is an active cuckoo community out there with answers and things are pretty simplelike other reviewers have noted there is nothing on the bottom of this very light unit to keep it from easily sliding across your countertop like a figureskater you may have to hold the unit still with your extra hand while you press menu buttons there ought to be skidproof rubber feet on the base of this unit to prevent that as is the case with many other small kitchen appliancesi never got this cookers clock setting feature to work correctly because the minmymode button never changed over from my mode to let me set the clock minutes even after holding down the button for several seconds following the instructions fortunately the minutes on the clock upon unboxing were only  minutes off from my local clocktimeif you are older like me make sure to wear your reading glasses and turn on the overhead kitchen lights to operate this unit the small digital screen has no backlighting and there is no light indicating that the rice cooker is even on but youll know in a couple of minutes when it starts to make a few cooking noises inside and lets off some steam and rice aromathis is a very nice entrylevel micom rice cooker that looks great on the counter doesnt take up a lot of space has a lot of versatile cooking functions and produces its advertised results i recommend it for those reasons however i am already upgrading to a pricier zojirushi pressure induction heating rice cooker of course i we could all save money by cooking rice and grains the old fashioned way by sweating over the stove but i love the convenience of a handsoff rice cooker plus it gives off less heat in my hot summer kitchenvery nice nice entrylevel micon rice cooker but "
2160,2,the size of this light box is perfect for my needs however there is a noticeable crease in the white backdrop that is very apparent in photos the lighting can only be controlled by plugging it in or unplugging it which causes a small slowdown in shoots when lighting needs to be adjusted there are two  lighting units installed one off to the top left and the other at the top middle there is no lighting to the top right this causes a need for more lighting since it does show uneven lighting in quick pictures i am guessing this is why they did not show any photos of the lighting units and placements had i been able to test this out a lot sooner i would have returned it for a different model but i missed the return window and all i can do is send it to the back of storage while i search for something more professional and less brandednoticeable crease and lighting challenges
14269,5,i love it good quality rice cookerprefect
17588,5,"i grew up as basically a meat and potato guy my mother made rice a few times per month i married a thai lady and for the past  years have jasmine rice most days made in a standard  liter rice cooker picked it up new for  when it conked out many years later i decided to get my wife a good rice cooker and bought this onein comparison the zojirushi is much better made with a bunch of bells and whistles our old rice cooker had only  switches on the sideone to cook rice and the other to keep it warm aluminum pot inside had  liter markings the zojirushi has an electronic menu with settings for various types of rice a screen showing how much time is left before done plays a little tune when startfinished etc inside pot is much heavier with different  liter markings for different kinds of ricein terms of quality of the cooked rice the zojurishi markedly improves the smell taste and texture of the cooked rice compared to our old cooker it has also made me much more aware of the different features and characteristics of different kinds of riceis the zojirushi worth the price difference most definitely yesmakes a big difference"
8995,1,im posting here because i cant get ahold of the company we have family members that have the same camera and it works great so normal i would recommend this product but the camera we bought doesnt change settings there is a dial around the lens you can rotate according to the lighting around you but we have had multiple films come out completely black because although we twist the dial to a different setting the setting itself never changes the light indicating which setting it is on never moves the camera was gifted to my by my husband and we have since past the deadline for returns wed be happy to return the item if we can get a replacementsettings dont change
11169,5,i do not recommend this productnot so great
14266,5,ive been using my rice cooker once of twice a week for a month and its great we had to work on cook time and water amounts for basmati rice   set on multigrain but all the issues have been user errors and getting used to it its nonstick surface cleans easily even when my teenagers forget it overnight overall very pleasedexcellent product
8442,1,broke after one print printer always says there is a jam or out of paper when there isnt troubleshooting did not fix problemdoesnt work
5019,2,i am only do  stars because of all the addons  star is because the camera doesnt workbroke
15506,4,i got this moosum rice cooker since it is more convenient to use compared to boiling rice on the stove and checking frequently to make sure it does not burn what attracted me to this brand is that it has ceramic nonstick coating which is healthier compared with other types of nonstick coatings a plastic spoon and measuring cup are also included there are some guidelines for use and initially i followed the recommendation of one cup of rice and one cup of water the rice was not cooked with some brownish spots at the bottom so i added another cup of water and cooked again this time the rice cooked perfectly i was surprised that my fourfouryearold daughter who does not eat rice at all liked the rice and ate an entire bowl of rice one issue is that there was a strong chemical smell at the first use which decreased after several uses overall i am pleased with the purchase and i would recommend this rice cooker to a friendit makes great rice had some odor the first few uses
10514,5,"ive always wanted a rice cooker and ive found my perfect one its great for solo or two so simple even i was able to use it makes rice great every time  but not just rice you could have soup or oatmealmost importantly is that the company stands behind their product and have a great response time to queries lets just say they have some of the best customer service that ive ever experienced and i deal with cs a lotthe little cooker that could and the great company behind them"
7079,1,poor quality picturesbad gift
7503,2,just recieved it and made a few videos not a bad camera this is my second akaso camera first with eisonly bad thing is it seems to eat up batterys really quick like in  min other than that im pleased with it well ok after a few days with this camera i have changed my mind  the sound the sound on this camera is really bad when im walking doing a videro i can hardly hear what im saying plus most the time all i hear is a loud click click and other various sounds and when i go to edit it even if i do delet the volume the track skips and screws up thr music  the touch screen needs some work cause have the time i can find the format and half the time it wont show upi do like the wide screen option but im going to use this camera as a back up on my trip to alaska next month cause the the camera i got last yr has superior video and sound ill keep the other as aback upnot a bad little camera but
588,1,the picture quality is a throwback to my first camera flip phone of the early  i got this for my daughters birthday with the intent of it being a decent inexpensive starter camera after a few months i wondered why she wasnt using it i cant wrap my mind around how anyone could leave more than  star and not be as disappointed as i am with ittake the money you were about to spend on this and give it to someone in need bet it on black or red buy alcohol or set it on fire to stay warm for  second and it will be a better investment i wish she had told me sooner so that i couldve returned itdont waste your money on this
5277,2,this camera was not the best constantly had to charge it and i barley used it error codes kept popping up need a different camera
1150,1,the camera is good for price but the charger isnt appropriately sized to hold the battery correctbattery charger doesnt hold the battery
9350,4,"ive been trying to meal prep  times a month we have  fridges and one chest freezer loads of freezer spacegetting up in years and some health issues equals me just not being up to cooking every eveningenter meal prepsthe moosum cooker helps so much i am able to load the rice along with oil and saute the rice for  minutes and then add water or broth set it and pay attention to other tasksi did need to work out the ratios of liquid to rice we like it just cooked because after freezing then reheating it can get mushy if it was fully cooked before freezingi like that i can also cook oatmeal quinoa and brown ricethe steamer basket is handy for veggies or even slices of velveted chicken or pork look up how to velvet meat comes out so tender and very easy to doi have not had a problem with sticking as i put oil in and precook my rice in butter or oil before adding liquid this also brings out a nutty flavorthe instructions are a bit broken but start out with smaller amounts till you get it like you likethe size we received is rather large but for meal prepping it is a good sizeit also has a nice look if you have to store it on a counterfor this size it was  at the time i ordered it i feel its a good value "
14004,4,the inner pot of my existing panasonic  cups got some scratches instead of replacing the inner pot which is quite expensive than buying a new one so i bought this toshiba  cups of which the inner pot is pretty small but its okay as i have reduced my intake of rice it has several settings of types of grains however all of the preset cooking times are very long  cups i did mixed grain takes  hr  min brown rice is even more longer  hr  white rice takes  minutes while my panasonic takes  minutes for sure my electricity bill has gone up i dont know if i can manually shorten cooking time or the rice wouldnt be cooked enoughgood looking rice cooker but takes too long to cook
17196,5,the instructions were not very clear to start but after some trial and error we found the best solution there are quite a few different rices available and they all cook up differently once we found the right combination for basmati rice we have it  or  times a week it steamed up some vegetables nicely it does take longer than stove top and sometimes the rice is not quite as fluffy that could be due to the type of riceit works beautifully
5252,2,i am back home after a week road trip where i used my new nikon i am very sorry to report that i am disappointed in its performance i am going to be returning the camerathe color saturation is very poor i took photos of the redwoods and the color from my cell phone camera was better than the nikon also i met a man on my hike who had the same model and he had the same complaint about the poor color quality fortunately i am able to enhance and correct the color of these photos with my computernikon   cmos digital slr camera with lensesquality of color saturation
8822,1,i only received the camera not the extra film pack as the listing says bundle dealdid not receive the extra film
6017,1,i cant get the pictures out of it my pc says its lockedpictures wont download to pc
4704,2,this didnt work with my phone even though according to the website it woulddidnt work for me
8857,2,it looks great the specs are great the photos are ok but less than my older fuji or panasonici must get a better one with less difficult control system many times i bump into the movie mode by accident it is just where you hold the camerabasically it could be improved by removing some controls and menu optionsthe regular zoom is good the digital is not most time it will not even work
4761,2,i cant lie the light is bright but very very very small the light only covers the palm of my hand and after using it it went out in less than  hours dont buywaste of money
973,1,quality of the picture was poor as well as the zoom featuredont waste your money
7478,2,edit i have been sent a  replacement camera by the seller to see if i like it better i am temporarily upgrading my rating from i to  stars until i have a chance to test the replacement and will will update my review if the replacement proves to be better than my original purchaseoriginal reviewi have had a gopro that ive used for diving for several years but i bought this  as a backup video camera for underwater use it looked okay when i got it but i was not impressed with the waterproof housing the latch on top did not have a lock and flipped open with barely a touch of my finger also the back screen is a touch screen but you have to set it before you put it in the waterproof housing as it has a hard back and you cant change anything once its in there but no big deal i set it in dive mode and adjusted all the other settings stuck it in the underwater housing and took it for a dive the camera and waterproof housing worked fine i just had to use a rubber band to make sure the cheap latch didnt flip open and flood the camera while underwater this is where the negative review comes in the video quality is horrible this is advertised as a  camera with a dive mode which is supposed to add some red back into the video even set at  picture quality my videos are all green with really blown out whites i didnt see any way to white balance in the camera settings and obviously i couldnt change any settings underwater anyway i shot various things turtles coral reefs fish etc and tried videoing from different angles to see if it made a difference in the coloration it did not all the videos are very poor quality so i put this piece of crap away and used my gopro for the rest of the trip we just got back from the philippines and of course the return window closed  days ago so i cant even get my money back buyer beware save your  and put it toward a gopro or a better quality camera this one wouldnt be a bargain if it was free very disappointedwaste of money not as advertised you get what you pay for
14252,5,as a family that eats rice all the time on the days we want to be quick i got it for my mom and we both love itlife saver
2042,2,what frustrates me the most about polaroids is that they just cant seem to get it right every time they come out with a new device there is some kind of fatal flaw that really devalues it this one for example takes about a minute to power on before you can use itfatal flaw
9456,5,quiet and easy to use and clean 
14249,5,stop looking for a rice makerbuy this one easy to clean and use make sure you use the cup thats included for measuring and just pour broth up to the number of cups line i bought several before this onedont make the same mistake worth every pennyawesome rice cooker
5823,2,this camera is light and has powerful lens but it is very frustrating to control if you are used to a nonautomatic camera took this on a trip but ended up using my phone for photos because this camera wouldnt give me the functionality i wantedvery frustrating camera
2231,1,i was so disappointed with the product the films that we brought along with the product were defectiveit was such a wastedisappointed
3947,1,horrible broke after a few uses but not able to returnbroke after a few uses
14397,5,"this rice cooker truly exceeded my expectations my standards are pretty normal as long as it cooks my rice im happy however i didnt realize my rice could taste any better until i started using this rice cooker not only is my rice evenly cooked but my rice is so fluffy the brand of my rice is three ladies jasmine rice i left it in the rice cooker on warm for  hours and my rice was still moist and fluffy the next day its nice to have warm rice at any timeif youre looking for a rice cooker that is easy to use compact and doesnt take up much counter space see picture for size comparison with my hands and makes delicious fluffy rice go with this onefluffy rice and easy to use"
825,1,no valuedid not get a memory card with the camera 
12241,5,i use this product to make rice the rice is better than the other cheaper rice cookers i think its worth the priceits my baby now
13400,5,eassy clean love itlove it 
7029,1,play video what can i say bought this a while back was excited to get to use it but stopped dead in my tracks when i realized the  of cleaning solution was nothing but an empty spray bottle not amused and far from pleasedreceived empty spray bottle
11510,4,the polarized plug didnt work with the outlets i wanted to use when i found one that did it worked pretty well  the plug issue is annoying but the thing works wellworks alright
14845,5,as a person who eats rice on a regular basis this is a must have im very used to using rice cooker as but my rice cooker just broke so i had to get one this rice cooker is definitely one of the best finds in terms of price point and functionality its definitely worth it and must have if you doesnt know how to cook rice this thing is the answermust have
12071,5,worth the money for sure i use it nearly everyday ive had it for a year plus and its still going strong only downside is it takes an hour to cook so its slower but the quality is worth itworks well and makes consistently good rice
8816,1,regret getting it for my son for christmasthe picture quality is so badits so dark and theres totally no imagehorrible picture quality and the camera is so tiny
7164,2,although this device can be adjusted i never could find a way to make it comfortable to wear while my camera was attached perhaps the most annoying thing about it was the way it restrained your ability to reach different functions on the camera i have an olympus om de  mark iv its small lightweight with lots of functions if i loosened the fittings on the hand strap the camera didnt feel securely attached if i tightened it reaching various buttons or functions was either awkward or impossible maybe this item would work better for a point  shoot cameranot a good fit
1062,1,the actual picture quality is probably less than  megapixels when turned up to its advertised  megapixels do not buy bad product lieslie about picture quality
549,1,returned camera would not even power onreturned camera would not even power on
1142,1,it appears to change brightnessexposure randomly which has spoiled a number of videos a big waste of time forcing me to reshoot videos makes the camera unpredictable and therefore more or less useless to me the problem didnt really appear until after the return window was closed now i am stuck in my opinion beware of this productvery disappointed with camera
6540,1,picture turned out blurry no matter what you didnot very goodnotngood
3894,1,i didnt like this camera for the only reason you cant view any photos you took it wontallow you to see it from the display window it jams up and you have the shut the cameraoff and then back on and it might allow you one time to view your photos after that itdoesnt work anymore for the amount of money i spent it is a horrible camera and i wantto be refunded i have a warranty i took out and i want my money backit doesnt work
7132,1,it showed up completely broken would not recommendlow quality
4415,2,its clicking right along when it stops and displays a message about video exceeds resolution or something like that instead of skipping it and going on it just stops it chokes i could work with that but i have no idea which video is causing the problem i think ill turn it over to my  year old motherinlaw to figure out its a gift for herplays well until it chokes
1664,2,this was a replacement for another video cam  fhd that looked exactly like this one while it does have settings for   and  none of those settings cleared up the horrible choppiness and pixelation of the image  whether closer up or at a distancemoving the cam while shooting just creates a blurred mess and on the  setting every  seconds or so the video would freeze for a few seconds before continuingthere doesnt appear to be any focus on this  video or photo  even though instructions say to press the photo button halfway to focus then fully down to shoot did that no focus at all  everything blurry stationary target holding the cam stationaryintention was for topdown explainerrepair videos where it would be mounted at a fixed distanceheight with fixed lighting but did not pass muster for that  even though i ran through a number of combinations of settings  resolution white balance iso sharpness etc none of it seemed to matterreturning this tonight same day i received it fortunately after my last experience i only unpacked the cam usb cord and a battery to test if it cant shoot a clear image from a mounted stationary distance the rest of the accessories are useless i will give it a halfthumbsup for having a touchscreen which made changing settings much easier than the other model that didnt have thisnot great image grainypixelated no focus
2605,1,i ordered this one bec it came with the most film unfortunately the order i received only came with  sheets not  that the description saysdidnt send what is described
13184,5,best rice cooker ive ever hadbest thing i ever purchased
10510,4,i cook for two and its a great size but only holds one cup of rice alittle bigger would be betterlove it
3832,1,got this for my mom for christmas as she was tired of having pictures tied to her phone amd really wanted a beginners camera to capture moments however after chrisas she took it home began set upand it would never charge or power up needless to say it is months later amd im waiting for a return label because this is trashgarbage
1901,1,sadly this was a christmas gift for my daughter who i flew out to ny for christmas seeing i am a traveling nurse it did not work even after purchasing new batteries broke my heart that it didnt workit comes broken
3283,2,i took pictures with my iphone and then with the camera to compare the quality and the quality sucks im really disappointed on the screen it looks good but the pictures come out bad i also dont like that the zoom is buttons and it downs zoom smoothly returning so i can put my money towards a camera with good qualitythe quality sucks
6094,1,my camera doesnt work and im sending it backcheck ur stuff
9507,4,not such good quality but very easy to use good for the priceeasy to use kind of janky
7378,1,i bought this xl version thinking it would be much larger than other camera lucidas but no the viewing hole on this small lucida is itty bitty and i wear glasses which you can not do at all so there went  down the tubescheaply made tiny viewing hole cant wear glasses
10513,4,its more like a cup and a  rice cooker  cups for me made it over flow but it nice and smallits cool
7160,1,i was super excited to get this photos turned out super dark and i even tried editing it in the app and in other apps not worth the money i understand that the quality wont be exactly like it appears on your iphone but it was very disappointingnot worth the money
1789,2,i love polaroids but i have been having an ongoing problem since i bought this camera every time i take a picture of the first picture is white never failsi have had two other time polaroid previous to this one never had a problemhaving problems
6865,1,my son was suppose to use this snorkelingluckily i bought him a different camera to take also  because this camera even with the coveris not water resistant his sailing adventure and photos would have been lost if not for the other camera very disappointedthis camera is garbage not water proof resistant garbage 
7359,2,hard to see object to trace as image is too faint seehard to use
728,1,one battery was completely dead and wouldnt charge the other charged and that was a tease as it died and never charged again needless to say we got  pictures from itterrible battery life
8712,1,well the product seemed perfectly easy enough to use which it is but it does not work anymore all of a sudden every time i use it when i attempt to access the videos the pen wont show up on the computer now im kind of a techie guy so its not like i dont know what im doing i take out the media card insert it directly into the computer poof access opens right up from the card itself the video is always corrupted no matter how long i take the video it will read less than  mb and will not load due to corrupted file manufacturer defects happen especially coming from china i understand thatused it four times in about a week now the pen doesnt work
6416,1,not the best for riding a bike for swimming its ok not the best gopro overall do not buycamera not clear
4520,2,i purchased this camera to do  street view work the cameras frame rate does not align with the street view frame rate so its a hack job to use this camera for street view of any quantity it does work but if youre doing a walking video that google recommends  for the closest you can get is  frames per second this is a lot of overhead and it takes a lot of extra bandwidth and a lot of extra processing time on googles end repeated requests to support were looped backandforth with someone reading from the help pages for me requests to escalate were ignored its a great camera for action camera stuff but its only mediocre for street view the ricoh theta x is fully compatible with street view and offers the lower frame rates it is more expensive but given the amount of time that ive spent trying to work with these excessively large  videos i wouldve exceeded the difference in the first two weeksfrustrating for street view fast but poor support
2466,1,not worth the purchase your phone has better quality will be returningiphone has better quality videos and photos
14137,5,i am very happy about the small and compact size perfect if you want small portions singles or a couple very lightweight easy to store or cute enough to leave on the counter as wellcompact size and good price
2836,1,i bought two of these cameras for my daughters  and  the one lost all her photos of our vacation and neither one of them charge anymore after using them for barely  months they got these for christmas and by april they quit workingjunk cameras
12858,5,only downside is that i cannot find it on the vesync appamazing product really simplified my meal prep experience
17516,5,im puerto rican this means that our diet consists of  rice we love our arroz con habichuelas rice and beans with everything from fried chicken pork chops corned beef you name it and we will accompany it with rice and beans i have been making rice for the past  however today was the first time that i taste how rice is supposed to taste this machine makes rice so good and tasty the rice was fluffy soft not soggy not wet not hard just perfect im in lovethe best jasmine rice you could eat
10395,5,we eat rice a lot and this is so helpful much easier to cook rice with thiseasy way to cook rice
17243,5,instant makes great products this slow cooker is pretty awesome my crockpot regularly burns my food but this enamel covered cast iron was nice one caveat thoughthe keep warm feature only works for  hours so you should factor that in to your cooking time because they mean it other cookers will keep your food warm for up to  hrs you could easily add on a little time to the cooking stage because this pot cooks evenly thats the benefit of cast iron its also dishwasher safe very pleased with this purchasegood purchase
2656,2,the product is cute comes with games and obviously options up to  pictures our kiddo loved it until it stopped charging  months after purchasecute concept but cheaply made
2661,1,i bought this camera may  it worked great up until yesterday when it didnt turn on no big deal probably just had a batteries so we charge it get the red charge indicator light we let it sit on the charger for about  to  hours try to turn it back on again and nothing happened the camera does not get abused as we teach our kids to take care of personal belongings i will give you this while the camera was working it was a blast to play with my child easily able to point and shoot reviewing the photos was just hilarious from a childs point of viewcamera stopped turning on
10794,5,easy to use nice little rice steamerquick rice cooker

6316,2,bought this for christmas was fab up until it needed to be charged put it on change for over  hours and only charges up to  bars then you take a photo go to print it and the battery dies can now only be turned on when its plugged in charging really disappointed and  very disappointed children especially for the price 
14112,5,cooks perfect rice and cakesgreat machine
7220,1,restricts access to camera controls returned and ordered a leather wrist strap from another site insteadtoo restrictive
1751,2,i bought this last year as a birthday gift for myself i put the film in correctly but the camera only takes pictures half of the time the light flashes we have to really squeeze the camera to get it to take pictures and again that only works a fraction of the time my older model worked better than this ive kept the camera stored away because i get so frustrated with it very disappointed as i was really excited about this cameraonly works half of the time
5337,1,i opened the package and there were already about  pieces of film used and some other things opened i tried taking some photos of my own and they either came out blank or black also the camera settings were not working when i tried switching ititem already used and doesnt work
9222,1,bought two of them as gifts and both of them broke after a weekscreen broke after a week
11228,1,i put a cup of rice in the cooker brand new and the start button didnt work im super sad because its such a cute rice cooker i wish i was about to at least get an exchange oh well i just spend money that i didnt have to get a decent rice cooker but i suppose ill have to look elsewheredead on arrival
7806,1,this item looks good in the product pictures posted although when i received it i was surprised to see its not worth the almost  i spent on it the cover is not hard its plastic it could easily bend  break the photo sleeves are also super flimsy one misstep and it will tear it doesnt look like something that could be flipped through on a semi regular basis without being damageddollar tree quality
17133,5,i bought the instant zest rice cooker because i wanted a smaller unit also american test kitchen gave it very good kudos it did very well as a rice cooker which was expected but the clincher was that it produced great quinoa with just the touch of a button i always hated cooking it on the stove top and therefore did it only rarely but now i just put quinoa and water into the cooker close it and hit quinoa button and off it goes with great results nice and fluffy only have one other grain to trysteel cut oatsthis little machine cooks quinoa perfectly

8252,1,i ordered this camera for a present for my  year old upon turning on the camera a picture of a grown man with a black eye appears on the screen terrifying my  and  year old i am disgusted this product would be sent in a package to childrenhow does this pass any sort of quality control this was disturbing and just a horrible experience for my familyif i could rate no stars or negative stars i would but amazon makes you pickhorrifying
10042,5,"the lid is basin for all of the starchy liquid that comes steam port on the rice cooker the lid is hinged so it runs down the side when it is openedyuckpoor design"
1696,2,but it doesnt work unless its connected to the chargerits cute
6048,1,the waterproof casewasnt after about  minutes of my son using and playing in the water it leaked and the camera diedwaterproof case leakedcamera died
14143,5,wow my family likes this small rice cooker so much it looks great the cooked rice is soft and delicious the time and temperature are well controlled you can even use it to make a sweet and delicious cake very gooda nice and versatile little rice cooker
5296,2,i figured it would be a great entrylevel dslr based on all the rave reviews at first i was really impressed with the build quality look and feel and ease of use however when it came down to actually taking pictures this camera failed miserably im taking close up indoor product photographs for website use with plenty of lighting unfortunately every picture turns out blurry looking like theyve been shot with a circa   camera they may as well have been taken with a potato my iphone  takes better pictures than this camera ive tried every setting possible iso   closeup autofocus the whole  yards it came with a kit vr lens im wondering what else i can possibly do or maybe i just got a lemon looks like ill be going back to a cheap point n shoot they seem to work much betteri really wanted to like this camera
14097,5,remember you can also add fresh aromatics like garlic star anise or dry chilis to perfume your rice during cooking processeasy from the jump 
6059,1,much better options out there this camera is very small poor quality and cheap overpriced and very disappointedregretful purchase
3662,1,pics not coming out blank disappointed with this purchaseproduct not working as ot should
16948,5,this is the best rice cooker i had ever ownbest rice cooker
3923,2,i got this for my  year old to explore taking pictures i wasnt expecting super high quality pictures but the best picture i could take was approximate shapes of figures my son manages to block something that causes it to be completely black pictures as well im guessing it must be the light detectorvery blurry pictures
3726,1,fast shipping but bad product the charger dont workbad charger
712,1,play video returning this itemi wanted a small affordable camera to take on trips because sometimes hauling the dslr can be a pain i think this camera would have been decent but i immediately noticed a defect the sd card will not stay in the slot its positioned on the bottom of the camera instead of like most models who place this slot either within the same confines as the hdmi or battery ports theres also no cover to the sd card slot to keep it in place so i would need to tape it down also this camera only charges while connected to the computer so although it comes with  batteries you cant use one and charge the other simultaneouslydefective
182,1,we have gone through the included manual followed instructions online as well as youtube instructions even a professional photographer was unable to connect it with our wifi in our house we do have wifi and have no problem with other devices it was a total waste of over  wed return it but due to having covid we ran over the deadline and now seem stuck with this sham of a camerathis camera is impossible to operate
11125,5,this rice cooker makes the perfect amount of rice for either a single person like myself or even a couple people if you have guests the pot is extremely nonstick i only have to rinse it i out even when i make cheese rice or any other rice for that matter i love this thingbeyond perfect for a single person or couple
17567,5,"this is the best rice cooker ive ever owned quality is apparent and it has all the options i prefer and more unlike my old cooker this will not scorch the bottom of the rice even when left on extended keep warmwe use mostly jasmine rice and it nails it soft fluffy grains throughout with no crunchy or burnt bits i also appreciante how easy to read the water marks are on the inside of the cooking potno burnt bottoms"
8271,1,this item im sure is still usable i havent tried it bc its a gift for my niece the cat piece is missing which is the part that the strap they give you is supposed to attach to so that piece is useless as well without it it looks like fine quality i just think it needs to come with everything its showing this is not the item i purchasedbirthday gif for my niece
8320,1,i am very very disappointed with this product it stopped writing to the memory card with fewer than  uses save your moneywaste of money
7423,2,ive had  instax minis and love them the photo quality is great the  is supposed to have an improved auto exposure sensor so there are no options to select any photo ive taken indoors with this camera has been so dark as to be unusable i thought perhaps mine was defective but the other reviews confirm this is normal i received this from my son for christmas because i am a hobbyist photographer and i am very disappointed with the photo quality i will continue to use it so as not to hurt his feelings and am exploring using key lights but that defeats the purpose of the spontaneity and ease of use of the instaxpictures are so dark
8685,1,this was a gift for my niece for her  birthday she opened it charged it and the camera does not workhow do i return this product for another one or refundcamera does not work
850,1,in the instructions it says theres a close selfie mode  another mode however when i turn the camera on it only does one thing and the photos come out whitewashed like the light isnt correct im very unhappy with itdoesnt work properly
7995,1,i bought this camera as i thought the pictures would be clear but i was very disappointed as i paid  for camera that gives you blurred pictures 
3104,1,all  photos from the first roll of film will not develop this is after  hoursdefective box
9191,2,arrived on time but the performance was inconsistent and only fairinadequate flash
8684,1,this camera is terrible a complete joke and apparently its not even really made by polaroid when i went to them for help they said they license their name to many third party manufacturers and cant help a once great brand is now a complete joke worse i brought it for my daughter for her first summer at sleepaway camp and it captured two pictures out of hundreds very sad situation terrible producta piece of garbage would have been more useful
1708,1,my daughter didnt like it she said it was bad qualitydoesnt have auto focus
13520,5,"i loved the idea of not cooking rice on the stove so i checked around and found this rice cooker it was well rated although some people had trouble with it boiling over several people mentioned that this was only because they didnt rinse the rice first i have found that to absolutely be true if you wash the rice there is no boiling overthe little rice cup is smaller than a standard cup and ive used that cup to make one cup one and a half cups and two cups of dry rice everything ive made has turned out perfect i havent tried brown rice yet thoughive used water chicken broth and sometimes half of each i measure the rice rinse it well add it to the pot add liquid to the correct mark then set it and forget it it wonderful  would recommend with riceworks perfectly"
7636,2,not sure what happened but it worked for the first week then we took it to new york and it did not want to work at all it would not take the photo and when we got back it started to work againstopped working when we needed it
13762,5,i have been making rice with this product for over  months and it works great i havent used it for anything else except riceso far so good
11162,5,this pot works greatjust he right size for  people and steams veggies while it makes the rice  totally awesome easy to clean and store because of its sizeworks great
10809,5,discrepancy size inside the box

11999,5,the rice cookers smart function operates off a scale under the pot  cups of water and  cups of white rice make sure its on white rice function and hit start thats it my rice has never been so enjoyableeasy to use

7598,1,these lights are so flimsy they fling around they get knocked over super easy the stretch is not far enough so its a constant hagglethe most annoying part is that they have to be powered through usb while using no thanksflimsy
9537,4,"love this i should have gotten a bigger one lolif you cant make rice to save your lifenow you can definitely recommendi sick at making rice"

6306,1,did not work off the bat shutter did not open upon further investigation this is a common problem with this camera will be getting a cannon insteadarrived faulty
2060,2,the pictures suck dark and blurry i have instant pictures from  years ago that look better totally uselessblurry

10644,4,cooks rice very well is quick and convinient i wish that it would display a tone to let you know that your rice is done cooking but overall works how you would want it toworks as intended
2056,1,i bought this product for my daughter for christmas and i have always been super happy with my amazon purchases but with this one i am not my daughter has tried everything to take quality pictures with this camera but nothing seems to be working they are all super dark no matter the settings we have you tubed instructions read the directions and everything else we can think of any suggestionsmajor disappointment
5406,1,this camera could not focus on an object  out of  shots were completely out of focus the  th shot was slightly fuzzy i immediately placed it back in the box and sent it back total disappointment in kodakmy kodak brownie camera in  had better picture quality
2673,2,my daughter loved the camera at first we had it for just under a year and now after taking a few picture it freezes the only way to unfreeze it is to let the camera battery run out reached out to amazon and they told me to contact the seller but the sellers info isnt listed anywhere such a shame camera was cute and i had gifted it to friends kids but there cameras also seem to experience the same issue after some time not worth itwas great now freezes
2703,1,had this camera for about a month fully charged it before first use my son loved it for about a week the charge didnt last and now will not charge im about  days out of the return window so i feel like i got scammed this is a poor product that i would expect from a seedy overseas seller but not from amazondoesnt last
8043,1,check film pack i went through  boxes of film pack and the error keeps coming up did i buy the correct film yes i did apparently through research this error has been apparent  year back did i get a faulty one anyone encountered this before what is the quick fix what a dud 
7197,2,its a good strap only downside is that it constantly needs to be tightened on all ends if you dont pay attention it will come completely undone also forget about putting a tripod plate on the mount this comes with it wont tighten as much as necessary and will shift around a bitits ok but could be a lot better
4102,1,update  cameras will now pickup motion when nothing is even moving but wont pickup a person walking by but about  the time will pick up a car and a bird no problem but it seems to have trouble with humans i guess if your house is getting broke into by a honda or a blue jay your good i get a notification about  times a night i watch the clips and nothing at all is there no cars no birds no people nothing i adjust sensitivity and still doesnt the same thing have to turn the camera off whats the point of having these things how can they even release this system horrible ive never been so upset with a purchase in a very long timeupdateafter reading more about the motion detection i should have done more research before i purchased these cameras infared motion detection hmmm well the body is what  degrees im in oklahoma and guess what happens in the summer time here well  and  for about  months well if i move around outside how will this camera know im a person and not just the outside temp i even watched a video about it saying the temp outside may interfere with motion detection why would they do this so these cameras are good for winter or indoor use where the temp should be around  cameras are being returnedthis system is not good for actual home surveillance the motion detection seems to want to work when it wants to you have to be very close like  from the camera for it to detect you by the time it does detect and record it catches that person leaving or the back of there head will ferrals faceback app in the other guys would really come in handy  second clips are not long enough and as far as i can tell no way to change that the video is very clear but make sure the camera is not under like a porch or whatever it makes people to dark to tell who it is the live video is great quality but drains battery very quickly i really wish now i would have bought a wired system for this price i was just tryin got make things easier for onceabsolutey worthless
9952,4,great item will need a box over the aroma one as this item isnt authorized in the work space thankfully its hidden away for the annual potluckamericas number  rice cooker all over the box
17159,4,the instant zest rice cooker is basic but adequate in its performance i have used a couple of frankly cheap rice cooker and its true you get what you pay for those cheap cookers no more than  spued hissed and foamed with rice sticking to the pots bottom i just wasnt going to spring for  fuzzy logic rice cooker the instant zest has none of the issues of the cheap rice cookers and can be purchased in the  to  range if you have an instant pot it will cook rice to but its much to large and difficult to clean whereas the zest can be cleaned up with a damp sponge and takes up little space on your counter its features are basic  but it cooks good rice steams shrimp for fried rice and heats frozen tamales in no timesimple and easy to use rice cooker
1168,1,i did not like this camera i returned itterrible quality
7130,1,not worth your money cover cracked and broke the first time i opened itcheap piece of crap cover broke at first use
17019,5,this is a great way to cook rice and according to youtube a whole of other things also very versatile and easy to usegame changer
701,1,bought this for as gift for my  year old daughter even the reviews that its easy to use he came without a charger and the sd card will not work so i tried another sd card that did not work eithermissing parts and sd card does not work
1423,2,didnt come with anything and was overall horriblenot good
969,1,purchased this camera a little over a month the camera never workedit was a defective camera and returned it the seller charges  restock fee i would not buy againcamera is not good
7261,1,please avoid getting the silver edition go pro for it has some major issues firstly i bought this camera brand new and it already had a username and password its nearly impossible to change the username and password i even called support and they couldnt even help me finally after a lot of trial and error i attempted a factory reset and it bricked on me i tried million different things no sign of life currently in the process of returning this item i did some research and found the hero  silver is very well known for bricking easily i suggest getting a different modeli suggest getting a different model
7630,2,bought these lights to add some atmosphere to my home office turns out they barely light one corner of the room each even in total darkness and once you add a gel they get even dimmer very let down by the brightness not a one star only because the stands are pretty decent for the price overall the neewer ones were far superior at a similar or lower price point 
11391,5,it cooks my rice just how i wanted and it has easy buttons so i dont have to think i just put the rice in and do my own thing while it cooks 
11181,5,works perfectlyworks
14858,5,this is a nifty little cooking device its great for a quick meal and very easy to clean im glad i purchased it i live in a house of boys that play sports so something to help me cook dinner with ease is a mustnifty little device
8730,1,very heavy very conspicuous the camera position is very wide it is easy to find the camera not at all like the advertising shows that invisible not recommendedthe battery is invalid after one use
1370,1,not so great   fps quality is very poor especially at sunset try   fps as you can see in the photos the person is very blurry and the daytime photo shows the sky as white even though it was a clear blue sky im shocked leica would attach their brand on such a low performance camera just ok
3097,2,the pictures are not that great and it takes a long time for them to develop not a good value for my moneynot a good value for the price
1626,1,absolutely the most cheaply made pos ever returned it immediatelycheap and useless
1999,1,update to my review ive been a professional photographer for  years and have been using film since  i purchased this polaroid as a way for my husband who has zero knowledge about film or cameras to document me with our son all of our pictures whether it was optimal lighting conditions outdoor indoor etc came out blurry bleached black and always had some sort of chemical spots at first i thought it was a film issue and purchased additional film all photos came out the same very poor quality so now i believe its the camera itself i used my parents polaroid growing up so i know what to expect with polaroid instant cameras this seems like a poorly done knock off back to fuji i gobleached or black
13778,4,"the only reason it does not get five stars is it does not support oats recipethis model does not have oats setting i thought i could use porridge setting but it does not work porridge water comes out from the vent on the cover badlythe only way to make oats porridge is to add rice with  oatsrice  ratio porridge water does not comes out from the venttoshiba has models with oats setting but they do not have  cup sizecompact and does the work"
4717,1,i bought this for my daughter and it does not turn on  it does not work she was too little to use and until now i open it for her to use it and it does not work at all  whythis is junk do not buy it it does not work
4846,1,bought to use at a wedding photos so small you cant see too late to return would not buy again waste of moneypictures too tiny to see
474,1,cant even turn on because it didnt come with a chargerno accessories or charger
1878,2,this product worked for about  months and now it continues to just blink  wont take any pictures im truly disappointedgood but not worth hassle
3124,1,it doesnt matter whether the pictures are take inside or out the quality is horrible i bought this for an event which means i did t try to open right away now im pissed because i got on amazon to initiate the return and have missed the deadline so now im stuck with  worth of useless film and a terrible camerapoor photo quality
3544,1,got the gopro  was so happy to shoot my youtube videos charged it the day before got it set up to shoot my video when i powered it on it was at  when it was at  after i charged it the night before ok lets just keep going get it set on the stand in my air conditioned living room and pushed record its on its working ok great like  minutes later the front screen turned off so i panicked and went and checked it but it was still recording so i carried on realized theres a red dot that blinks to tell you its recording get threw the first part of my video and dont see the blinking red light go look at the camera and it says stopped recording due to overheating really in my nice cool living room on a stand not moving not to mention the battery now say  i had only been recording for  minutes i had such high hopes since this is for people doing extreme sports in all weather and im well not extreme at all sending backi had so much hope
17337,5,"i wont lie between this and the toshiba i had only known toshiba as a wellrespected known brand i grew up in the philippines and lived in thailand for almost a decade and toshiba is well known in these parts ive a toshiba convection microwave oven that i cant even buy here in the usaso i was hesitant to get zojirushi  a brand ive never heard of growing up in asia but it eventually came down to where each was manufactured  and with toshiba now made in china while zojirishi was still produced in japan  i decided to take a chance with a brand that is new to me yet apparently has been around even before i was bornand wow  zojirushi delivers inherently japanese its clever packaging was the first thing that greeted me this felt like it was going to be different after allhere in the us i found that rice seemed fickle i had initially thought it was the weather as i have had more problems cooking rice down south in florida than i had up north in virginia in florida rice wouldnt keep more than a day before smelling like socks at least up north rice lasted a day or two before turning it came to a point i thought the us was just importing really terrible rice it was only with my recent experience  with this zojirushi induction cooker  that i realized that it was the rice cooker all along that made a huge differencei cook jasmine rice and the zojirushi cooker cooks very quickly quick cook setting in less than  minutes ideally though it is best to use the jasmine specific setting  but always good to know that you can have  cups of rice cooked in about a quarter of an hourcomparatively rice cooked with the zojirushi cooker comes out more plump  it keeps its volume and even unfluffed it retains its volume the rice cooked in our two shame aroma cookers would always be soggy or crusty oh and dont forget the smell of socksfor someone who has grown up with rice  the zojirushi cooker is legit well worth the price and i am just sorry it took me  years in the us to realize this it was the rice cooker all alongthe only issue i found with the cooker is that with rice that is even better than what ive had back in asia  more rice is consequently consumed i have gained  pounds since not a fault at all with the cooker of course  but who else am i supposed to blame for eating more myself  pasian seal of approval"
3350,1,not good quality and need a really big selection card to get any video out of it terrible mic and very easy to break made out of plastic and is a piece of garbage do not buy thisterrible
14467,5,this is the best rice cooker ever cooks evenly very happybest i have ever used
5488,1,this was purchased as a birthday present based off of the reviews the reviews stated that it was the prefect camera for clogging and podcasts the software itself can not be downloaded to use as a webcam by the time this was discovered the return window closed and im out  dollars save yourself the time and moneynot for podcasting
14253,5,idk what fluffy rice is but this rice cooker is the best one ive owned in my whole southeast asian existence it takes a bit longer than the usual rice cooker because its doing its fluffy rice technology thing so i would suggest making rice way ahead of time or utilizing its timer issue where you set what time you need it made by you simply put in the ingredients and the timer will kick in and do its thing on its own to have finished fluffy rice by the time you set it if you got the money and you eat rice everyday this investment is well worth itfluffy rice
5826,2,the straps are too narrow to fit the very wide strap mounts the strap mounts looked crooked and misaligned very disappointed in this camera and the fact ill have to carry my camera in my hands at all times during this tripstraps dont fit the strap mounts
572,2,had to be returned as lens cover does not fit adequately 
10038,5,been using this for almost  years now and there have been no issues and works greatgreat product
3316,1,it never ended up working my siblings and i bought it for our sister it arrived and she plugged in the battery got the sd card all ready once the battery was ready she put it in put in the ad card turned it on tried to take a pictureand then it said it couldnt read the ad card she put the sd card in a similar camera and had no problem so it was no problem with the sd card we returned it and got a different one but same story nothing made it workdidnt work
5035,1,didnt work at all returned it didnt work the third one we got worked for a few days and then broke again this company and there product is trash lmaogarbage
8300,1,if i could give zero stars i would the box seemed like it was opened no sd card cord or instructions screen was scratched i immediately sent it backmissing parts
11564,4,didnt come with the veggie steamer basket 
15690,5,this rice cooker functions just like my current rice cooker except it is smaller it did not make small batches well as soon as this cooker arrived i had to test it out i just want to make a serving of rice for one without a lot of extra this cooker operates very similar to my current one except i got one great tasting serving of rice without the waste perfect for me i am delighted this is a good buy for someone who only wants small batches of steamed riceperfect size for singles or a couple
13138,5,this little thing makes great rice and the price doesnt break the bank it also comes with a vegetable steamer thingie and  rice paddles which is nicegreat affordable rice cooker
1715,1,camera is trash androids take better pics and videosthis camera isnt worth more than 
5181,1,the only thing that worked was the games couldnt tell you about the picture quality because the camera doesnt workdoesnt take pictures or video record have to return it
6841,1,the camera dies quickly charging it and changing the batteries doesnt helpno battery life
12209,5,i got this when it was on sale for just under  and some gift cards i had brought it down to about  at that price i love this thing i go out of my way to get khoshihikari homare rice and it makes just about the best rice ive ever had with the push of a button sorry to my japanese grandma 
8805,1,takes horrible pictures dont buy it pay more and buy a different camerahorrible
2273,2,in this day  age i never even thought to look to see if the stupid thing was rechargeable its not you have to either waste a ton on money on disposable batteries or buy rechargeable ones separately  them you have the added bonus of constantly opening the battery compartment to unload  reload the batteries its a hassleno rechargeable batteries
524,1,cant get the sd card to workthis camera is really no good
5134,1,the camera is horrible  the picture quality is so poor and the camera would shut off nonstop please dont waste your money  just use your phonedont believe in tiktok bs
11373,5,i moved into my apartment and just wanted a tiny rice cooker that i dont have to make too much in or that would take up too much room i love this one because its little and my rice comes out perfectso happy i bought this
4432,1,got this frame for my mom for christmas said it was user friendly but that has been anything but true uploaded nearly  pictures for my mom and after a few days found they couldnt be viewed in the web album contacted customer support and was told the files must have been brokencorrupted no idea what happened to cause this and they believe it to be a one time issue was told to download pictures delete them and reload them when i downloaded the pictures they downloaded as a zip file i deleted them as i was told to do and then when i went to reload them i found the zip file was empty therefore i lost nearly  pictures i would not recommend this product to anyone especially with the poor customer support i receivednot user friendly and customer support not good
14274,4,my previous rice cooker is nearly thirtytwo years old and it still works in the last thirty years there have been so much more innovations in rice cooking so i wanted to get a rice cooker made in this century i chose this one and do not regret it for a moment i can set it all up and delay the start time so it is ready when i am it is so easy to use and clean it is wonderful my former rice cooker always had cooked on rice on the bottom and the bowl had to be soaked every time not this rice cooker the nonstick surface makes clean up an breeze no more soaking for me it is perfect and i love the handle it makes it easy to get in and out of the pantryjust what i was looking for
6258,2,eh ive used it twice it holds out water well but its cumbersome the cheap disposable clear ones made out of the baggie material work just as well and are much easier to work with the only way i would recommend this is if youre doing work where your camera is fixed on a tripod or something like thatkeeps out water but cumbersome
17339,5,love the product perfect cook for brown ricelove it
10110,5,its the perfect size for a single person like me i make rice every other day or so and i love how easy it is easy to clean easy to cook i make  cups of rice and in  minutes its perfect a monkey could use this if you cant follow instructions you should go out and eat i only use this to make rice i havent tried to steam anythingfor a single personits a buy i make my rice every time with this
10005,5,we had a couple of rice cookers and this one is the bestvery good rice cooker
8282,1,i got it for my daughter after we charged it for the first time it didnt turn on againis not working
10383,5,very easy to use and perfect rice every timeperfect rice
9253,1,dont even bother my daughter got this for christmas as she was able to print one photo out of it and now all it keeps saying is no paper when there is paper in there and loaded properly waste of moneydont waste your money
5723,2,i bought this as an alternative because getting the hp  pack would have taken about a month from what it says plus reading the reviews people have said it was practically replaceable for the hpsprocket but im starting to realize the reason the blue printer card are only read by their respective product is because they align with that product so using an hp blue card for polaroid wont be the same i dont know what the quality of the photos printed on a polaroid photo printer may look like but its low if youre trying to use it on the hpsprocket its better you stick with hp for hpnot quite right
14787,5,the sticky rice comes out perfect every time and is much fluffier than our last rice cooker money well spentgreat rice
2697,1,product looks fun and works for about  day the viewing screen died and you cannot use the camera without the viewing screen the camera was purchased on sale about  weeks before christmas and so we did not find out about the problem until after christmas the company section did not respond to a request for help with this problem so amazon took over and gave me a refund for the sale price i really just wanted a replacement camera at the sale price seckton final contacted me after the refund and said that they could no longer help me replace the item  so now i have to rebuy the camera my grandson loved the gift but now i do not know if i want to buy a new one at full price beware of purchasing from this company and just know that it may not work out for youthe camera does not work  the video screen goes blank
9589,4,cooks the right amount of rice needednice and amall
1873,1,i had brought this camera for my daughter for christmas so could not test it before as it was a present and now when she opened it and we went to start it the films got stuck and never came out we changed the batteries and watched youtube just to see if we are doing something wrong and it was the camera it wont just eject the films out and gets stuck half way through and now its late even to return it to the seller totally disappointed especially my daughter as she was looking forward to having itmost horrible product so far
4204,1,arrived on time then started not working light just blinked orange and didnt take photosarrived on time then started not working light just blinked orange and didnt take photos
5846,1,camera stopped working very angry customer will never buy from this company again dont waste your money cell phones have much better cameras anyway sorry i brought this poorly made note camera was never dropped or scratched just stopped working and i lost photosstopped working
14918,2,received delivery looked like a good size but the inner bowl is not very stable when placed in the cooker i suppose they are all like that but this one was very unstable like i could move it back and forth about  inch ive had aroma cookers before they only moved around  inch returnedinner bowl shakes in cooker
13968,5,did an excellent job on white and brown rice able to control portion size easilyexcellent rice cooker
4551,2,i had the first generation and was super looking forward to this second one being  better it is better but not years of evolution better a lot of simple issues combined make its experience mediocre  losing connection to my phone never able to connect from my apple watch ultra very slow app im on an iphone  pro all in all given the price brand reputation i had higher hopes 
10634,5,my rice is great when cooking with this rice cooker rice are not sticky with this cooker and it is easy to cleancooks rice great
10649,5,great rice cooker for my partner and i it makes dinner so much easier never had any issues with the rice being overcooked it always comes out perfect easy to clean as well weve also been able to cook some frozen pasta meals that are meant for a skillet in herebest thing we ever got for the kitchen
6955,1,this was a second time purchase as my previous camera which i loved very much stopped working i put in new batteries and film the second i opened this new camera and turned it on and nothing happened not even a click  it doesnt work at all extremely disappointed with this purchaseedit after a bit of deliberation i decided maybe the first broken camera was a fluke i ordered again and the same exact thing happened do not buy this camera my previous experience with a working model was so great but its just not worth the hassle of receiving a broken item and having to return it its a risk and its definitely not worth the moneyreceived a broken camera twice
2050,1,there are no words for how terrible this camera is and i am incredibly disappointed every picture is fuzzy color is faded and washed out its just awful i thought maybe it was bad film so i got new film but it made zero difference yes its super easy to use and the directions are clear however its a terrible camera do not waste your money on thisterrible  do not buy
11419,5,so pretty works the best rice oak cooker one of the bestsmall rice cooker that works the best
5222,1,it sucksmy son was only able to use only once would not work the next day
9349,5,"we ordered this electric rice cooker to replace our broken one and we do like the one touch auto warmer and ceramic scratch resistant features we have been using to cook rice and and other dishes for the past few weeks and we do like that it cooks really fast and well and evenly and super easy to clean up after each use we do like that it comes with food steamer spoon and measuring cupanother thing we do like that it has stainless steel casing and appears to be sturdy and durable so far it works great and seems to be good value for bucks i will definitely recommend itdurable easy to use and clean and good value for money"
2023,1,i got this camera to take on vacation i charged it up the night before so it would be ready to use i pulled it out the following day to take some pictures and it was dead i thought maybe i didnt charge it long enough but i was certain the side light was green when i unplugged it so i charged it up again and made double sure it was done charging and unplugged it for the second time about an hour had passed and i was wanting to take a picture and ill be dang if it wasnt dead again so i recharged it for a third time and it lasted about  minutes im considering a return but it does take good pictures and i do like them however if youre far away from a charging source you wont get many pictures taken before it diesgreat camera terrible battery life
14307,5,i used one of the cheap ones for years never imagined the need for a decent steamer then i woke up you like rice buy this if you dont like rice and start using this you will actually like rice its that goodstep up
16588,5,we have two in our household one black and one white his and hers  we compete so eat a lot of rice perfectrice cooker
957,2,its a good camera for random things but if you plan on making this a content camera its  i dont recommend for high quality use but for mid regular stuff then yes purchase but personally its a no for me camera review
15624,5,i read all the instructions prior to use i interpreted this diagram to say  cup of white rice to  cup of water which sounded incorrect to me but i did it anyway that first batch of rice was toasted and undercooked so next time i followed the instructions on the bag of rice and had a much better result i give this  stars because it does work very well comes with nice accessories and is very easy to clean the inner bowl that the rice cooks in is actually nonstick that means no sticky rice starch sticking to the pot and needing scrubbing its a nice unit that works well with nice accessories once you figure out the rice to water measurementsignore the diagram on the front
3338,1,good pictures when it works when taking a picture the shutter button presses down without taking a picture causing you to think you have taken a picture and when you get home you only have about half of the pictures you thought you have i threw my away after using it on vacation and ended up with very few  sstar
1268,1,the camera comes with no memory card  which with a little reading i suppose wouldnt be an issue except the camera is only compatible with one specific type of sd card right now we can only use it to take one picture before memory says its fullthe sd card is not included
7402,2,i wouldnt spend my money on it if i were you the first photo i took was nice but after that one photo they came out horrible  the first one was with light from my phone and the one on the bottom was with flash from the camera either way they both look really bad the design is nice has a nice look to it but it does not take good picturesdouble think it
7290,2,camera looked very well kept almost brand new however the battery life is horrible i believe it needs a new battery or there is an issue with it since it drops to one bar immediately after it is used for only  minutes i wish i wouldve been advised that there was an issue with the batterygopro hero 
6904,1,i am so thoroughly disgusted with this type of camera i bought this camera as a gift for my daughter nearly a year ago march of this year after only  months of very few uses it just stopped working altogether replaced with brand new batteries and still nothing this is the second instant camera that my daughter has had the first one stopped working as well before it should have  the reason for buying this one pictures were never of the quality they should have been i will never buy another of these and especially for a gift who wants a gift that lasts no longer than this one did very disappointedcan you give a  star review
4591,1,the camera stopped working after  months of use each time i try to take a photo the flash charging light quickly flashing indicating an error but you cant troubleshoot it its too late to return it waste of my moneystopped working after  months
9678,5,youll get the hang of it after a few times i use a cup of rice to a cup and a  of water super easy done in less than  minutesperfect
448,1,its the  time that i bought as new and arrives usedif you buy this product check everything in detail because you can buy it as new and isnt good luckattention bought as new and arrives used
9276,5,weve had rice cookers for years and this tops them all it leaves the best yummy light brown parts on the bottom especially if you leave it warming for a while didnt think my fave part could get better but it does thank youeasy to use makes delicious rice
6382,1,absolut garbage i have had a few action cameras from the cheaper side and dont expect gopro quality from them but this particular camera has the worst video by far it reminds me of the quality of video you would get from a flip phone made in the late  dont waste your time getting this one just to send it right back spend a few more bucks for something with far superior qualitythe worst
8470,1,i bought this camera during my vacations sent it to one of my hotels and when i arrived it was waiting for me  i wanted this camera for  years now but in my country its very expensive so i waited for my vacations in the us to get it and as you can imagine i was super excited and happy so i open the camera read the instructions place the battery place the film pack press the power button the lens comes out it comes back really quickly closes and the visor gives me the e error thats it i spent my vacations searching ways to fix it in google i called amazon support i cant return it because the returning time is out i called fujifilm they dont even answer the phone on weekends i didnt have the time to ship it to them and wait for the camera anyway i went to best buy looking for a kind soul that could take a look at the camera but noone knows how to fix it so i bought a new one in best buy they sold them on iban outfitters too and the new one works perfectly but i have a broken camera that no one knows how to fix and i wasted precious time from my vacations so i really strongly advise you not to buy this camera buy it on best buy or urban outfitters you can prove your camera before exiting the store and any problem you have you can take it to them and they will exchange itit never never never never worked not even for one picture
1829,1,bought this camera a protective glitter case and several packs of film for my daughters birthday she loves the camera that said we have not been able to take a single decent picture with the camera weve even had blanks come out film is just too expensive to justify all these troubles my daughter begged me not to return this camera she said she was willing to accept the terrible quality photos i however am unwilling to spend all that money on film that will just turn out poorly i have decided to try a replacement camera for my daughters sake on the chance that this camera is defective itll break her heart if the replacement camera has to be returned as  yr old daughter loves this camera i however am very disappointed with it

8986,1,writing a review because we actually have had two of these now none were good the first one jammed up while ejecting the film cover it was then impossible to remove the film cartridge the replacement camera worked but any picture taken outside was overexposed we bought this camera to take on our vacation the reason we wanted it was to put the pics in our junk journal of the trip this type of pic just seemed more nostalgic and personal than printing digital pics so we got this none of our outdoor pics came out even though it was overcast  we have a professional nikon  camera and have taken photography classes  this camera is junk do not buynot good for outdoor pics

2610,1,it said it came with  films i only have one pack which is  where is the other  didnt receive the film it was supposed to come with 
7572,2,needed lights for a christmas photo shoot and i have mostly negative emotions about this product the positives list is short lights are bright with multiple brightness settings i liked that there are color filters you can slide over the lens but they dim the lights too much to be of real use if you need to adjust the color you would get better results editing the photos in your computer on the negative side the tripods stability is just atrocious a light tug on the cord its down a light touch on the light its down a cool breeze outside its down i havent seen such terrible engineering of a simple concept   legs should let a tripod stand another negative is the shortness of the power cord measuring at a little over  feet which can sound like it should be long enough once you factor in that the tripod stands at about  feet fully extended you basically need to set it right by the outlet or use extension cords as a money saver they also went the apple way of not including power bricks with the product of which you need  the best application for this product is probably on your desk either streaming or video call but for photographers spend the extra money for something betterbright lights unstable tripod
244,2,im a camera novice but a tech junkie my issues with this camera could easily be attributed to me not knowing what the heck im doing all that said i was dissatisfied with the quality of the images i was able to capture regardless of the amount of light present i understand that this may be an issue related to the sensor size andor my lack of skill re recording images but id expect a long zoombridge camera at this level to be fairly intuitive in the point and shoot modesi ended up returning it and purchasing an  instead my experiences with that camera have been much better the  has a few additional features that were cool like  burst but the  takes better pictures in regular and low light the touch screen on the  is a nice touch in theory but in practice it was really unnecessary ive had no problem getting accustomed to the  menu and making quick and easy adjustments using its dpad the only other feature that initially drew me to the  dust and splash proofing seems to be something that is truly only beneficial to more serious photographers or those who might find themselves in incredibly tough terrains for extended periods with little ability to protect the camera i used the  on a two week safari in tanzania and encountered rain dust etc with no effect on the operation of the camera or the quality of the picturesmeh pictures  touch screen and ruggedizing arent enough to sway you away from the  if you can afford it

14284,5,"ive had this rice cooker for a bit over a month now and make use of it every day it has cooked my calrose and jasmine rice perfectly every time and ive been able to have rice ready to eat at all hours of the day by making use of the timer and keep warm feature none of the rice ever burns which is an issue ive had with rice cookers in the past so cleaning and maintaining the nonstick insert doesnt require much effort the inner lid and the steam vent can also both be removed to clean and dry making it easy to prevent the accumulation of bacteria and moldedit  year later and it still looks and works like newthis rice cooker makes consistently great rice and is designed for easy cleaning and maintenance in just a month it has saved me a lot of time and money and is more than worth the  i paid for itworth the money"
13945,5,i got this because i wanted to start changing my diet by eating a nice filling  uncooked of rice every morning i now make either rice bowls to go brunches or rice balls every morning before work it has been such a pleasant change of pace in my life of course the functions wont compare to zojirushi a popular japanese brand in japan but the price def beats it i strongly recommend this rice cookergreat for kitchen or room use

17335,5,"i have had the  cup zojirushi machine for a couple years and i love it i decided that i needed a bigger one and i decided to splurge a little bit to get the induction heating the reason i originally bought the  cup machine is because it had heaters on the bottomsidestop not all zojirushi machines have that this one does i decide to go for the  rather than the  because it also has the bottomsidestop heating along with the induction heating of course so the rice turns out perfectlyi would suggest that you think about which size you want because when they say   cups versus  cups they mean japanese cups which are about  the normal size of american cups plus i cook a lot of jasmine and basmati rice which you can only do about half of the amounts listed in the description when they are talking about a  cup machine or a  cup machine they are referring to short and medium grain rices only jasmine and basmati rices need much more room to expand to become light and fluffy so you might want to go with the bigger machine if thats what you plan on making most of the time i was also considering splurging even more and getting the machine that had induction and pressure cooking but that machine is really best for making sticky rice if you like light fluffy rice then this is the machine to get in case you were on the fencethis machine is excellent no matter which size you choose and other reviewers have mentioned that there is a humming sound thats how induction works and it is very minor and doesnt bother me at all almost sounds like a computer fanexcellent machine and highly recommendedanother great machine from zojirushi read my note about the appropriate size"

4984,1,my daughter was so excited to get a poloroid camera for her birthday it was broken in a week now the light just flashes and it wont take a picture weve exposed all the film trying to figure it outcomes with a bunch of plastic junk which she was excited to open but if the camera itself doesnt work pointlessdont waste your moneybroke in a week total junk
8332,2,the camera is cute and has a ton of features my daughter loved it but like a week after the return window closed the front facing camera glitched out the screen is fine the selfie camera still works but the front facing one suddenly has a bunch of tracking lines going across every picture very disappointed i wasnt expecting a dslr quality but it wouldve been nice for the thing to last more than  monthslined pictures
5921,1,the product was ok i ordered a blue kodak camera and got black the case is ok was expecting a little more out of the case but it will do just like to have what i ordered since this was a gift for my daughtergetting what i ordered

6635,2,quality sucked felt like a  digital camera from  was not worth the money at allquality of video and photos sucked
3008,1,i bought this refurbished camera because my daughter wanted one and at the time all i could find in the lavender was the refurbished we got it and thought everything was great until we started taking pictures and there are  little white lines on every single picture we thought it was the pack of film so used all of it goofing off the attached pics and put in a new pack and got the same results so we knew it was the camera and not the film needless to say i returned this one and was able to find her a brand new one that isnt refurbished only wish we wouldnt have wasted  full packs of film to figure out that refurbished is not the way to godont buy refurbished
17690,5,"now that i have owned this for  years its probably time for a review the rice cooker still works great even after all this time the amount of water you need will vary from brand to brand but  of the time less water than the line will result in better rice than at the linealso as time goes on it does a worse job at keeping the rice warm without yellowing i would not keep rice in here for longer than  hours nowadays i just cook my rice and scoop it out into a container for storing overall pretty good rice cooker for    years is about  a year and still goingbought this in "
14874,4,this particular rice cooker does not have a nonstick coating therefore only four stars but my daughter absolutely loves it perfect rice every timecant live without it
11260,5,"this little rice cooker has really helped me make it through the last few weeks ive been struggling with some things and found myself not eating because i just couldnt handle cooking if it involved more than four steps that was two steps more than i could manage i didnt have enough spoons iykyki ordered this rice cooker in pink and i really like it it is marked with water measurements on the inside of the removable cooking pot plus it came with a scoopcup that is marked with corresponding rice measurements so i didnt need to get out measuring cups the buttons on top are so simple  on menu rice start then you just walk away  minutes later i am on the couch wrapped in blankets binge watching judge judy eating rice if you have a nonmetal spoon you can eat right of the removable cooker bowl  after you have let it cool downdont expect this to do big fancy meals it does up to two cups of white rice brown rice quinoa or oats so this isnt family sized but if like me you just need to make sure you eat something this is perfect it would also be good in a dorm room or to travel with or in an office i really really like this it is now my favorite appliance it helps me to hold on to a spoon or two each dayjust what i needed"
6923,2,i bought this as a replacement for my broken fujifilm intax wide camera i bought in  or so i never had a problem with my old one pictures were always great i dropped in from quite a height at disney world so i needed a new onethis camera seemed the same just upgraded and sleeker however i have had nothing but problems half the time it doesnt even take the picture sometimes it takes two photos on one exposure so its a layered imagethe top photo is actually two photos printed on the same exposure the film doesnt get pushed out after a picture is snapped sometimes so the next time you go to take a picture it just layers it on top of the photo that didnt get pushed out previouslythe bottom photos shows the weird things that can happen with this camera i always hold it with a steady hand and yet things like this happen or the exposure and light turns out weirdvery disappointed and now have no good polaroids from a once in a lifetime trip i brought this on i do not recommendmalfunctions all the time

15005,5,"i have a zojirushi rice cooker but i wanted a rice cooker with a saute function which the zojirushi doesnt have i had bought another brand with the saute function but it was a sautesimmer function which meant the unit would saute until liquid was added and it would automatically switch to the simmer function for some recipes this doesnt work i tried cooking  cups of steel cut oats in this cooker and it boiled to the top leaving dried oatmeal on the top of the cooker as well as clogging up the steam release i returned this cooker and decided to try this comfee rice cookeri have had this rice cooker only a couple of days but so far i am happy with the results so far i have made steel cut oats that i make in quantity for my husband and i to warm for breakfast i put steel cut oats water cinnamon brown sugar and a little vanilla in the pot the cereal came out perfect using the brown rice setting i will explain later in this review why i chose the brown rice setting tonight i made brown rice pilaf i used the saute setting melted butter added and sauteed the onions added brown basmati rice and garlic added beef stock and seasonings and chose the brown rice setting the rice was perfectly cooked and fluffy even though the unit was on keep warm for  minutes the rice was not crusted or burned on the bottom with my zojirushi rice cooker i have to remove the pot from the cooker as soon as the rice is done or the rice at the bottom of the cooker is crustyalthough this rice cooker comes with only a basic pamphlet of user instructions you can download a more comprehensive manual that includes few recipes the following is a description of the cooker controls what can be done with each and how they can be usedcooker controls stopkeep warmpress the stopkeep warm button to stop the cooking process and to keep cooked food warm onoffstartpress the onoffstart button to turn the cooker on or off and to start the cooking process delay timerpress the delay timer button to delay the start of the cooking process for up to  hours use the  and buttons to adjust the length of time decrease time or temperature increase time or temperature temppress the temp button to raise or lower the temperature and then press  or  to adjust temperature can be used only with saute and diy cooking functions timepress the time button to adjust the cooking time and then press  or  to adjust cooking time can be used with the slow cook oatmeal chili pasta soup stew steam saute and diy cooking functionsas for the cooking programs im not sure that all of them would be useful as temperatures are not stated for any of them the  rice setting are pretty basic quick rice cooks white rice in a shorter amount of time white rice cooks white and short grain rice and brown rice cooks brown rice and long grained rice the oatmeal function cooks traditional rolled oats and can use the delay timer to have oatmeal ready for breakfast for steel cut oats i used the brown rice setting that has the longer cook time required for steel cut oats soup soup and stew functions provide a simmer at a low temperature but the temperatures are not stated the slow cook function does not allow hi and low slow cooking the temperature is set at  degrees that is equivalent to the hi temperature on slow cookers if you want to slow cook on a low temperature you could set the temperature to  degrees on the diy function for the saute function you have control over both time and temperature this is one of my favorite features as it works to saute onions and garlic for rice pilaf and risotto as well as for browning meats used in soups and stews for the steam function you have control over the time which is really all you need for steaming to change the cooking function or the time and temperature press stop and then select the function and time and temperaturei have pressure cookers and other multicookers that have multiple preprogrammed functions and honestly i dont use them most of the time for some foods i think a slow simmer produces a better result than cooking with a pressure cooker my primary purpose in buying this rice cooker was to have the saute function for making rice pilaf and risotto happily i have now found that this rice cooker does a better job of cooking rice than the expensive zojirushi rice cooker i have after hours of research and reading reviews i have finally found a rice cooker that works for me for me use of this rice cooker is not complicated at all its pretty straight forward once you know how to operate it the downloaded manual does help but some of the operation is learned by trial and errorupdate for those of you who like steel cut oats which my husband and i prefer over rolled oats this is my recipe for steel cut oats cooked in this rice cooker this make   quarts that lasts my husband and i  days   cups steel cut oats  cups water  tsp pure vanilla extract  tsp cinnamon  tbsp brown sugar i use coconut palm sugar  cup or more raisinsplace everything in the rice cooker pot stir turn cooker on select brown rice function press startto warm the oats for breakfast put desired portion in a bowl add a little milk and microwave for about  minute on high what could be easier i have used this rice cooker multiple times since i bought it and so far i am very happy with itupdate as mentioned previously i have never been a fan of rolled oats to me cooked rolled oats always tasted pasty my husband likes them so i made a batch for his breakfasts i added all ingredients to the pot and used the oatmeal setting ingredients i used were   cups water  cups rolled oats  tsp vanilla extract  tsp cinnamon  tbsp brown sugar i used coconut palm sugar  cup raisins or more as desiredit looked pretty good and tonight i decided to try it i spooned some into a bowl broke it up into smaller pieces and added some milk then i warmed it in the microwave for one minute wow it was really good i guess it make a difference on how it is cooked i will definitely be making rolled oats for breakfasts againi hope this review was helpful for you i will update this review if my opinion changeshas the functions i wanted but some auto functions may not work as well for others"

3749,1,my granddaughter asked for this so i got it for her only shes twelve and ready for something real this is not a real camera in the sense that you use it to take pictures of any sort of quality therefore the price is at least twice what it should be we took one or two looks at it out of the box and sent it back i contributed the money id spent on it to a fund to buy the child an actual camera which will only cost about twice what we paid for this overrated piece of junk dont fall for itedit added  and now the seller has been badgering me for the last  hours offering to pay me to change my review i find that highly unethical i will not change my review because it is truthful in addition to what i wrote i will echo something other reviewers have said which is that the camera would not work for my granddaughter unless she kept it plugged into the wall i checked what she was doing to confirm that and found it to be the case the seller offered me a tutorial on installing a battery into the toy camera i told her that in addition to the fact that i dont need to be shown how to put a battery into a camera i own two nikon dslrs the point was moot since id returned the camera weeks ago now im going to go and check to see if i really did get my refundtoy and nothing more

6475,2,first the positive  the item arrived much faster than the expected delivery date the led light is very compact thin and light since it has the internal battery instead of using a separate camera battery now the negative the internal battery does not last long i charged it fully  solid lights on the battery power level at the beginning of the day and when i needed to use it during the evening the battery indicator was flashing one light and it wouldnt turn on i recharged it again the next day and the same thing happened again another negative point is that while there are  dials one is for the white light and the other is for the warm light other light panels ive owned that had the dials would make one for the brightness of the light and the other would be to adjust between temperatures lastly its not asbright compared to other light panelsinternal battery does not keep a charge
1585,2,when ordering it said to get a card and gave the ssd card info it takes a mini card not a full size cardvery small
4741,1,it didnt workvery disappointed it was for christmas and it didnt work
10921,5,loved the steamer although it doesnt hold much fast cooking rice perfect every timeeasy cooked rice
8547,1, the item its a gift for christmas its comes with a lot of us crash and no battery whats going ona lot of us crash a new battery
1968,1,the audio is the video setting doesnt work properlyvideo audio doesnt work properly
8963,1,i was very disappointed with the quality of my pictures the zoom is not good over all perfor mance i rate a  unhappyit does not take good pictures i wanted for a cruise and very disapointed
10890,4,after a couple of times me using this i finally got my rice cooked the way i wanted it although i wish i would have bought a bigger one and i did like the way it cooked my rice i probably wont be using it again due to the fact that i can cook more on my stove just as good as this rice cooker cooked it i was disappointed in the product although im not sure if i was disappointed in my choice or the product itself thoroughly read up on it before purchasing itwish i would have ordered the bigger one
1115,2,the camera is better for pictures than it is for vlogging  my camera came with a bad mic and the playbacks have an echo and lag really bad you definitely get what you pay fornot recommended for vlogging
769,2,bought this for a friend in august of  and its given him issues ever since he got it data regularly corrupts so he loses pictures all the time and the quality of his photos will go from great to terrible for no reason or fault on his end if i could get a refund i woulddont buy this one
1670,2,play video so im not going to lie the camera was nice loved the color of course but i did end up sending the camera back the quality was very poor its a good buy for a child i wanted to record my youtube videos on it but i couldnt the sound wasnt very good eitherall honesty
1680,1,i was trying to record myself shopping when i looked back at the video i looked like i was stealingcheap poop
7076,1,came broken and did not turn onhunky
8977,2,i like this camera but ive taken very few pics because the battery dies very quickly ive charged the battery went to menu and adjusted settings to my preference and only taken a half dozen pics and its died poor battery life
12276,5,why didnt we buy this before this makes the best rice compared to any other method weve tried the instructions are a bit wired for a native english speaker as they are clearly translated from japanese but it isnt hard to figure out we had perfect results the very first timeperfect rice every single rime
6297,1,just a piece of garbage not worth the moneylow quality product battery doesnt last more that some minutes have troublefocusing images sound quality is horrible just anothe cheap china productpiece of garbage
185,1,charged the battery till light turned green only to find out the camera shutter was glitching back and forth and no display along with no button functionality so basically nothing worked at all and it was delivered to me this way replacement has been ordered only thing i can have a good rating would the customer support seems as if they sent me a returned camera or a bad one in general not sure what happened here at this price though i was sweating bullets and really hate to have to go through sending one back and getting a replacementsent a dead camera
950,1,my camera arrived faulty  after charging it the entire night it still wont turn on once disconnected from the charger and even when connected to the charger various buttons dont work including the flash disappointedfaulty product
3144,1,dont buy all  expiry date exceeded 
14887,4,we ordered this rice cooker to replace out previous one that broke  when it arrived it was a lot smaller than we expected this is good for maybe  adult servings worth of rice  we sent it backits small
1251,2,a nice camera but it does not come with the memory card that is totally my fault because i did not read thru the entire description of the camerai was the one who short changed myself because i did not read thru the entire desciptionithe lack of a memory card was at the bottom of the description i would suggest for amazon to place the lack of a memory card at the very beginning of the description so that short readers as myself will be aware of this and not complain when the camera is deliveredtotally my faultread all about it
9522,5,i got this as gift for my daughter n soninlaw and they love it  its perfect rice comes out fluffy n cooked to perfection they loved it great gift
11961,5," i seriously cannot say enough good things about this rice cooker i set it up and for  cups of rice i was expecting it to be done in an hour as indicated but the fuzzy tech literally cooked it to perfection in  min and as you can see when i opened it was amazing rice i had no idea making rice was this easy on this thingthe manual is pretty big and good reading material but thats if you wanna be a master and know everything it can do but just for white rice this thing is incredible and fast and easy to get ready my wife was incredibly impressed saying she cooked rice for years and this rice cooked it so much better and saved her time to work on chicken or veggies instead of worrying about rice we are hispanic and eat lots of rice a simple  one would not do we ended up going for this baby i could not cook rice for my life on a pan on the stove but this thing made me a pro with no effortcleanup was too easy due to the nonstick pan only  things to clean and dry and put away the retractable cord and the handle makes this a game changer for a family get togetheri honestly would have tried so many  dollar ones if it was not for the great reviews of this cooker do yourself a favor and spend the money and forget the other ones this is definitely the oneabsolutely incredible"
13257,5,i liked how big it is for my family we eat a lot of rice and this rice cooker meets the needs for my family its easy to use clean up easily and cooks fastworks great
17392,5,"i had been on the fence for years on whether or not to buy a rice cooker i wanted one with plenty of options on it which of course adds to the cost although this rice cooker is kind of expensive to me it came with the options i wanted and then some it cooks rice perfectly ive used jasmine sushi and sweet rice in it so far and they all came out great to my surprise i can even cook old fashioned and steel cut oats in it they have a page on thier website which has directions for other grains cooking the oats is just as easy as doing rice and they turn out awesome too no more scorched steel cut oats trying to do them in a paneverything cleans up nicely as well even though you cant throw the parts in the dishwasher they clean up easy enoughoverall im really pleased with this purchase i was worried about spending so much on a rice cooker but i hope it will last long enough to pay for itself it looks like it is solidly built and i dont mind paying for quality and attention to detailshould have gotten one years ago"
14857,5,got this for my husband who is quite challenged when it comes to cooking rice this is easy to use and the rice comes out great everytime love that it doesnt have a smelly toxic non stick coating like some of the other ones out theregreat little product
1604,1,i bought this camera and it broke after one day of using it i am not sure why because i was careful and cannot think of any logical reason for it to break it constantly freezes up and will not show me my pictures so i never know if theyve been saved or not i wish i would have just spent a little more money on a nicer digital camera because this camera is now worthlessterrible quality do not buy
1959,2,and it comes with two batteries and memory card  two starts right therethe first impression  its a camera from the toy stand at the gas station the second impression just confirms itit would be a good first camera for  year old kid and the price tag should be anywhere between  and maybe  the price its currently sold at amazon it is very cheaply made very primitive menus and limited features i highly doubt this camera has  sensor and something tells me that  optical zoom is nonexistent about  digital zoom  maybe  optical  nopeautofocus is a joke especially with zoom it takes several seconds or more for camera to focus i can go on with it but the camera goes back to amazon so i will rest my caseit powers up
9452,2,dinner was done and over with dishes were put away and kitchen was cleaned and the rice was still not cooked all the way we had to run it through three  minute cycles adding more and more water each time before it finally cooked through either we arent understanding the directions correctly or this machine does not work it says water to rice ration which we followed but it clearly needed about  times the amount of water to make our two cups of rice cook could be user error but something else seems to be wrong as welltook three times as long to cook two cups of rice
14972,5,this rice cooker is an excellent investment for anyone who loves rice its easy to use and produces perfectly cooked rice every time super versatile and its able to cook a variety of different types of rice as well as an automatic shut off to keep it warm makes dinner super easyawesome rice cooker game changer
865,1,i feel like this is a cheap knock off of the one that i received myself for christmas ive taken or attempted to take multiple pictures on this device and for some reason the film doesnt come out even though it says pictures were taken and removes the amount of film available do not buybuyer beware
17001,5,the instruction pamphlet wasnt includedinstructions
6847,2,camera specs are terrible i made a huge error in purchasing this camerawater resistent
5978,1,i thought getting a gopro would be good as ive tried cheaper brands before it it was a terrible decision the battery drained  in a couple minutes it overheated you have to download everything twice it struggled to stay connected to my phone it cuts your video into lots of small clips and the touch screen is barely responsive id be upset if it was  but over  get outta here guess ill save up to get a mirror less camera my phone is way betterbad battery bad touch screen bad interface
3835,1,unfortunately i read the reviews after the purchase was made i gave the product the benefit of the doubt the battery life is awful within take a few few photos and viewing the terrible quality the battery warning was already flashing dont waste your moneythis camera is junk
13006,5,"play video this rice cooker is great the interface is easy to understand albeit digital i like how compact it is if you live rice but are concerned about space this is the perfect rice makersleek"
5992,1,i love go pros and the quik app i bought a hero  directly from gopro but it had audio recording issues i have at this point in time received my  warranty replacement and it has the same issue as the previous two when recording the audio makes popping and static sounds it is not user error customer support suggests warming up the camera before recording for  minutes and it seem to work but really so i can return this  one maybe and hassle with go pro for weeks like i did to get the third one but for what one more hero  with audio problems very frustrated on youtube search hero  audio problems and you will see lots of posts buyer bewareserious audio recording problems random popping static noises
10506,5,"i was quite skeptical that this would work for how small it is and the fact that i got mine used but like new because of that i figured there was something wrong with it till i tried it out for myselfpros its a perfect fit if its just for one to two peopleit cooks the rice perfectlyits super easy to usedoes not take up much storage spaceeasy to cleancons it only makes roughly a cup and a half of riceonly enough rice for one to two peoplethis is definitely good for college students whom live in the dorms or even someone with very little space like someone who lives in a tiny homeworks perfectly"
9104,1,multiple packs contained deformed film waste of moneyuseless
8831,1,heres a picture quality comparison to the left is the best quality picture i had gotten from the polaroid go mini to the right is my first picture taken on the fujifi instax mini  the polaroid go for me was constantly terrible quality took  minutes to exposedevelop to barely end up even exposing to begin with and the film for it is more expensive than the fujifilm the fujifilm is  for  pics the polaroid go is  for  pics i had gotten the polaroid go due to having a super old fujifilm camera middle school age old and im now  and wanted to upgrade was so excited just for the film to not work i just exchanged and got the fujifilm instax mini  and the quality is  better youre better off with the fujifilm instax for a cheaper or same price but much better qualitywhy not to buy it
1992,1,i am so upset i bought this product i have been the proud owner for  years of the instax fujifilm polaroid camera and have never had any issues i was exploring other brands to try something new this camera is the worst do not waste your moneyabsolute garbage
10198,4,i wish products were built to last longer than a couple years this rice cooker did everything i expected a rice cooker to do and at under  im not sure how much i can complain but stillworked well for a little over  years
7883,2,this printer prints all of your photos pink its not the film as i had two different zink packs my friend bought the same printer and her photos printed in pink as well it gives you the option to adjust color but its nearly impossible to get it to look like the picture from your phone i tried multiple different pictures with multiple different color schemes  all pink will also leave random lines in pictures that looked like when a regular printer runs out of ink please go with another printer so you can avoid the disappointment my friend and i went through after spending so much money on this first pic is original pic second is what it printed same color highlighter used to block out faces for reference will be asking for a refund on photo paper since you cant return thatwill print all your photos pink
13923,5,this is a beautifully designed product however the manual is not well translated into english i find this cooker works great for low carb rice it is bit pricey for a normal cooker however if however you are looking to enjoy rice without all the carbs this is the real deal 
5273,2,its a beautiful camera but since i bought it the point and shoot button has been problematic i sent it back to get fixed once and now the same issue has surfaced again i feel like my money was wastedits a beautiful camera but since i bought it
3009,1,i bought this camera for my mom as a mothers day gift i expected to be brand new and in the regular packaging but that wasnt the case they poorly wrapped it and it looked used as the camera was dirty and had a huge scratch mark on the side of it not only that i found cheaper better ones elsewhere do not waste your timedo not buy
12713,5,it makes a fluffy rice that isnt burnt on the bottom we rinse the rice in the pot as it is easier to do than our previous rice cooker we do hand wash all the parts but it is quite easy to dothis is an excellent rice cooker
6016,1,been through  of them in less than a month of use worthlessreturned  that quit working
9871,4,bought as a gift very nice itemnice item
7268,2,the camera stopped working after a few months send it to gopro and they fixed it but the camera was never the same again the video looked awfull even in daylight thought it was the sd card so i bought  different brands and sizes all looked the same almost non usable footage try to send it back to gopro but instead i sold it to a less quality demanding friendi would not recommend this to a friend not reliable at all
5971,1,dead on arrival wont even turn on tried charging for hours replacing battery official gopro battery pack with charger replacing ram card doesnt workfound a youtube video with  views that shows u how to fix the gopro camera if it wont turn on tried the methods and they dont workif there is such a video with  views it indicates this gopro  camera is just not reliablewont even turn on
14937,4,"update to my previous review i still like the lower toxic option so i ordered another to give as a gift to a family member it came very used and dirty so embarrassing  disappointed that the company didnt clean and quality check this product will be returning in case there is something else wrong with it that caused someone else to return it since that minor detail was ignoredi love that there is no toxic nonstick on the cookware i have been able to clean the stainless steel just as easily as i had been with a nonstick optiongreat lower toxic option update added"
2091,2,instructions are in microscopic print printed in light grey ink on white paper no one in my family could read them iwould have returned it but we wanted it for a party that day print quality is good  lots of fun decorative borders  accessories to amuse kidsunreadable instructions
4915,1,it immediately filled up with water we followed the directions and locked it shut it didnt matter we missed the return date by  weeks bummedits not waterproof
909,1,i read from alot that the add on mic did not work it works but it needs to be charged and has no cable to charge it and says no place it needs it the charger for the camera came in broken i have other chargers but come on how simple i can see how some have issues with no working charging brick and no cable for the micfor the money nice but missing parts also charger brick is broken
3802,2,i take pictures of damaged cars for estimates can not get clear pics of vin labels very blurryit wont focus in on fine print very blurry
1337,2,when i recieved the camera it was not sealed in the box the box was open and the camera and strap were loose in the larger box no instructions included i dont even know if it is all there very dissatisfiedcamera
7371,1,very difficult not for medifficult
10636,4,cook well i would buy it againnever again
14487,5,great rice cookerwonderful product
5231,1,i got this for my niece for her  birthday she dropped it on soft playground foam top from just a few feet she is small and she was just holding it the day we gave it to her and it broke and will not turn back on she was very sad but while it worked it was fun for herbroke almost immediately
3641,2,only received  of the boxes of filmwebsite shows more film than you recieve
16783,5,absolutely love this rice maker it makes  cup of sushi rice in about  min my only complaint is it needs a rice spatula holder i just end up sticking in the back of the water port opening im going to  print a holder and affix it to the sidequick
2855,1,not kid friendly terrible picture quality cheap madesave your money terrible product
8302,1,i gave my  yr old grandson this camera on may   but by july  it was unusable due to a inferior quality build the charging contact on the side of the camera broke loose inside so it can no longer charge i would like to get a replacement from the company but there is no contact email or address i would never buy from this company againwould not buy this again
13005,5,"this is the best rice cooker i have ever had it comes with an informative little packet with a bunch of incredible recipes that showcase just how many things the cooker can dothe front is digital and has a touch pad where you can select the type of grain the length of grain or what function you want steam for veggies rice or use as a sautee pan for like omeletsthe outside is sleek and looks nice just sitting on the counter our prior rice cooker would always get gummy and gross on the top portion where the steam vent is and this one has a detachable part so you can actually clean it i dont know what the technical name for that part is but if you have had a rice cooker you know what im talking aboutwe did the initial cleaning and washing before the first use and thrn immediately put in some regular white instant rice to try it out it worked so well the rice wasnt too sticky or clumpy and had the perfect textureit is kind of big but it has a lot of different uses so you can combine a few different appliances for just this one most definitely worth the pricehigh tech yet easy to use"
1494,1,horrible do not buy this piece of junk
129,2,this camera is super cute i bought it for my nineyearold and she loves it picture quality is good enough for her the only problem is she constantly has it plugged in because this camera will not hold a chargebattery wont hold a charge
8753,1,bought this for my daughter for christmas it stopped working about a month ago and no way to return or exchange it it doesnt take pics when she pushes the button works about  of the time very frustratedbad quality
3137,1,wrong camera film it did not fitit was the wrong film for the camera
14081,5," pros excellent quality of cooked rice super fluffy and moist compared to lowend ones keep warm function does not dry out the rice easy to use timer function is very convenient with  different timers to choose from compact with exceptional build quality cons no streaming basket included not sure if its possible to even steam food without a basket that fits well it takes a long time to cook the rice specially if you are used to lowend cookers that are done in  mins white rice takes  mins for brownparboiled its almost  hr not the easiest stream vent to clean the instruction manual could be betterexceptional rice cooker no steaming basket takes  mins for white rice"
8489,1,so disappointing took the camera out of the package and to my surprise the charger was only for european outlets if youre in america do not buy this product unless you intend to purchase an adaptereuropean outlets only
3817,1,i cannot attest to the quality of the photos because it didnt work long enough for us to see them on a larger screen less than  hours after my daughter began to use it the camera would only turn on if directly plugged into a wall no matter how long we charged the battery forpoor quality did not work longer than  hours
17257,5,i love this rice cooker it is big enough to make rice for a large croup or you can make just enough for three people works great and is so easy to use and the cleanup is a breezeworks like a dream
10067,5,love love love this little rice cooker the rice comes out perfectly every time its just me and my roommate but we wanted to cook more from home instead of eating out and we both wanted to try a rice cooker since it can kind of be a headache to cook rice normally this is super easy to use now we make chicken baked in the oven and rice all the time and feel a lot healthier for it i want to try cooking the chicken in the rice cooker since the instructions say its possible but we havent tried it yetone of the best purchases ive made
12181,5,i think what i love most about this machine is that you can just throw your stuff in and then forget about it normally with rice you have to worry about over cooking it burning it etc with this it will keep the rice warm and fresh for you even if you forget about it for a few hours so if you like a lot of rice this is definitely a nobrainer the only complaint i would have is that i cant seem to figure out how to stop it from playing a longer than desired song every time it finishes but thats probably user errormakes perfect rice every time
17312,5,this is a very heavy pot and lid so it must be handled with care the cooking versatility is fantastic however i stay close by when using this just because it does not have the automatic features the instant pots havewonderful addition to my kitchen
6435,1,at first glance it seemed like this was going to be great value but this camera was very glitchy and a nonperformer no instructions were included just diagrams of features but was easy enough to change settings if youve done the action camera thing before the led indicator lights gave no indication to when the batteries were fully charged so it was a guessing game until you look on the screen for the battery symbol the battery life on both batteries was about  minutes the video could be played back on the display of the camera but could not be played back on a card reader on the computer i tried a  card and got it to work one time no quality controlcant view videos on sd card batteries are junk not a  capacity
5876,2,photos are blurry and all come out with a blueish tint would not recommend this camerapoor picture quality
2351,1,product was given as a birthday gift and after using it it died and will not turn back on we have tried a new charger and all the troubleshooting i can find on this product the original buyer also left a review and was told to take a videohow can you take a video of a dead cameradevice will not turn on and no help information to contact company
17084,5,"becoming empty nesters  wanting to downsize from the huge  cupper i bought this i wanted something that made rice quinoa  oatmeal i couldnt be happier with the results after cooking all  i love steel cut oats but hate to stand  cook itbrown rice came out not sticky for the first time ever for mei cooked asian flavored quinoa  it was amazingalthough it takes longer than a pressure cooker style i have found a perfect arrangement for my breakfast  get up put  c steel cut oatmeal in with  milk   c of water in the pot push oatmeal on the settings make my coffee  the oatmeal is perfect  ready in  min i would like to find a way to half that as it is too much for me but i think this might be minimummy only complaint is that the booklet that comes with is basically useless it has no recipes it sends you to an online recipe bank that has recipes for the onepot pressure cooker  very few rice cooker recipesi recommended this for my daughter  she is now seriously considering one for their small apartment kitchen its a good cookerso happy with my purchase  perfect brown rice quinoa  steel cut oats"

1645,1,doesnt work time not waterproofreally disappointed  angry dont work at all no time function and not waterproof
6131,1,the camera was well maintained but half a dozen uses later i experienced the infamous battery exhausted message the  decent pictures i took were not worth the price of this camera now i am without a camerathe camera was well maintained but half a dozen 
3015,1,refurbished and does not come with film nor batteriessave yourself the trouble and buy one new elsewhere with all the parts to take photos on day onemuch of this is misleading at best this is a refurbished camera  says so right inside the box the only thing in the box is the refurbished camera and a small lanyard no film no batteries just a refurbished camerai contacted amazon when the first one arrived and they said they would return it and resend another one with film the second one arrived just like the first one  no filmthis would be a miserable gift to someone since they couldnt use it until they ordered film and waited for it to arriverefurbished and does not come with film nor batteries
8966,1,got about  pics with it then it stopped working seller told me to try something see if it would work still wouldnt do anything seller refunded my moneygot about  pics with it then it stopped

15482,1,it does not cook short grain brown rice well applicable in sushi style edible maybe enjoyable absolutely nothorrible  for short grain brown rice
1400,1,this camera claims to have  and  this thing is worse looking then my  webcam not only is it awful quality but it just does not work at all i have a microphone for it but the camera does not work with it and i know the microphone works because me and my sister tested it over discord the camera does not work with it it will only use the microphone built into the camera witch is a awful sounding mic i should add awful video quality awful built in microphone doesnt work all it does is take crappy looking photos and low quality videos do not buyawful
16978,5,it is a great machine it works very well it make the most fluffyest rice
5052,1,bought it for by own bday first set of film worked and then all of a sudden stopped really disappointing for the amount of money spent for itmarch 
11953,5,we bought this rice cooker last year and overall this has been a game changer this cook the rice amazing we are from dominica republic so we like our rice not mushy so my wife adds  measurement of water for every  cups of rice our whole family now owns this rice cooker one of our first part is that this rice cooker keeps the rice hot for so longbest rice cooker ever
6047,1,i didnt want to believe the reviews so i bought this for our son it worked until he submerged it and then it instantly stopped working disappointingimmediately stopped working
8299,1,bought this camera as a gift for my daughter i charged the camera and followed the instructions camera would not take pictures at all every time you would select that option to take a picture the camera would shut off completely after further review looks like the item was used as the packaging it came in looked worn do not purchasepiece of junk
12725,5,i like the various choices on how you want your rice to cook the steam basket is a plus because it is largethe saute and slow cook features always very usefulperfect rice cooker
15863,5,this rice maker works great comes with rice maker measuring cup and spoon easy to use makes fluffy rice fast easy to clean built very well good price and fast deliveryworks great
1732,1,i bought this camera to bring with me on hikes unfortunately the write up far exceeds the cameras quality the stabilization is nonexistant the autofocus requires at least  full seconds to settle and the picture quality at  was really not worth the price on top of this the battery lost its charge with the camera being off overnight i would not recommend this cameraaddendum this company contacted me through my personal email to attempt to refute my review they offered me a camera at no cost which i believe to be not worth owning and a  dollar gift certificate when i refused and asked them to not contact me again they did this is why i am dropping to one star and adding this to my reviewvery disappointing
17574,5,"when i asked my friend which rice cooker to get since my old one is not cooking properly anymore he asked me back this how religious are you with your ricehow religious im asian so i very much care for rice but using religious to describe how much i like my rice unheard of but by then i was extremely sick of my halfcooked rice so i went ahead and got this rice cooker made in japan is very crucial as welland boy let me tell you good rice is a religion after using this rice cooker i cant accept any other rice from anywhere anymore i have been converted ill say no to the rice provided by the restaurant only to eat the dishes with my own cooked rice if you have the money and willing to properly wash your rice get this rice cooker i swear on my goldfishs grave which is the toilet that it will not fail you but seriously do read the manual and wash your rice properlygood rice is a religion"
3319,2,not worth itpoor quality

794,2,bought as a christmas gift for my daughter so i didnt open it til now definitely do not buy wish i could return pictures are not good quality or print worthy and lens doesnt close leaving it very vulnerable its going to basically be a paperweight disappointedwaste of money
5987,1,pro nothingcon horrible camera and too expensive for the what you get cheap product i have a cheaper camera and work the same than this onedo not buy it
8418,2,the paper is pretty small and the images do not come out the best quality but it is manageable for the price i dont think its worth it comes with few very small papers not worth ittoo expensive
4963,1,this camera was a huge disappointment and now its past a month   days and amazon will not let me returnthis camera was a huge disappointment all shots in all modes out of focus and blurry
11083,5,works great makes rice well this is the second one we are pleased with the price  qualityrice cooker
6980,1,so sad i only had this a couple months with hardly using it but planning to take it on my european adventure and it just randomly stopped working after something like  photos the lens is motorized and one day no dropping or accidents when i turned it on the motor runs but nothing happens i am past my return window so i have to use the warranty program hopefully they will fix it but that wont replace my lost memories in europe ok i used my digital after it broke  but i was hoping to make a polaroid album   cheap and plasticawesome when it workedbroke after around  shots 
8798,1,this is supposed to come with film paid an extra  for a box of film i never receivedmissing piece
7986,2,although a great product in that you can select the pictures to print if the case is accidentally opened it will eject a filmalso the quality of the pictures is nit great with the tech available nowadays should nit be having mediocre quality images 
10490,4,my son is a huge rice eater so the single serve minute rice is not enough but two servings is too much love that its the perfect amount of rice but what i dont love is that when its done cooking it immediately goes into a warm mode which cooks the rice on the bottom until it burns to counter that i have to pull the plug immediately when it goes to warm mode and serve immediately the good thing though is that its incredibly easy to clean so even though the bottom browns its not caked on or anything also ive never had a rice cooker so it takes some time to cook like  minutes its not instant but the rice is greatperfect rice but

13963,5,i have used this rice cooker for one and a half month and i am very satisfied with my purchase the cooker is very easy to cleangood value
14761,4,it works great just like our previous cookoo the display is very hard to read the characters have extremely thin lines and the display is not backlit we sometimes have to use a flashlight to be able to read the displayworks great but display is hard to read
8276,1,at first the camera worked fine the picture quality is not very high but my  year old didnt seem to mind however after one or two uses the memory card got stuck into its slot and now it is impossible to get it out so i have no access to the pictures and cant do anything with themgot damaged very soon
6365,2,shot videos and the quality just wasnt there huge disappointment as i had higher hopes but everything is blurry and the quality varies a lot based on the sunlight differences on a cloudy day versus when the sun was behind clouds versus when it was notvery disappointing
7566,1,this camera is so difficult to use that it will only frustrate your kids only one of the functions even worked its junkhard for kids to use no fun
2608,1,i got the product broken i wanted to return it but i told myself that it was going to work turns out the polaroid is brokenas soon as i used it it was broken the flash is stuck
7296,1,i recieved a defective battery would not hold a charge for more than ten minutes and now it wont even turn on i plan to send it back and hope to have better luck with another camera the photo quality is great hope to turn my gopro luck around went on an epic trip and could only use the gopro for a couple shots luckily my iphone camera still got the job donei plan to send it back and hope to have better luck with another camera
6369,2,it is a functional camera although for the price you get what you pay for the microusb charging slot and sd card slot are on opposite sides of the same board making them so close that you have to disconnect the charger to take the sd card in and out battery life is very short but it might not have fully charged yet the main problem is the picture quality which couldnt identify a face from  ft away  might be generous and forget about having any color contrastmore like 
9876,5,very easy to use to get perfect sticky rice ever time turn it one select white rice select setting  and wait for it to beep i liked it so much i bought another for my vacation homemakes perfect white rice
1468,1,camera did not work out of the package put in batteries took a picture and the camera froze couldnt reset or turn off the camera even took out the batteries and put them back in but the same resultcamera did not work out of the package put 
201,1,product already doesnt work and i only used a few timesdefective
5976,1,i have been working with gopro since december  to resolve issues related to using this camera as a webcam i have contacted gopro customer support weekly providing videos of the problem performed several manual updates sent diagnoses files from my pc and they keep promising that the support case has been escalated and someone will call me back  months of this and still no call back dont buy this camera if you are looking for a webcam gopro has only front line tech support this camera is useless if you are looking for a wecam and gopro support is non existentgopro will not work as webcam
9192,1,there is a long delay between pushing the shutter and getting an intended photo so you are not likely to get your intended photo if the subject is moving there seems to be a  second delay not very practical also the picture quality is awful this camera is garbageshutter delay
5855,1,still learning i have one from  that i love not too impressed so far hope to change the rating soon but its supposed to be better zoom etc and i just dont see it yetstill learning
8991,1,received an old looking broken camera that someone else must have bought and returned  the camera wont take pictures the shutter is stuck open and has scratch marks all over it real disappointingreceived someone elses broken camera
15562,5,this little rice cooker works great i even used it to make oatmeal and it did not disappoint i definitely think this is a rice cooker for  people it worked well liquids did not overflow and no messy inner cooker lid piece to worry about the simplistic design does allow for fewer pieces to clean and maintain it is very straightforward there was a weird smell the first time i used it but then it went away i washed it well so maybe that smell was a new appliance thing this would be great for those learning to cook getting their first place or limited in spaceworks perfect super simple very small so its best for small spaces or small families
4525,1,i bought this last may   for our vacation when we arrived in hawaii may   the  works perfectly and when im about to use it the next day something is wrong with it as you can see in the pictures the front lens turned pink and the other side of the lens works fine i tried resetting it and it did not work now i dont have anything to capture good memories and stucked with this useless  good to worst action camera
8599,1,didnt come with the privacy cover as advertized seems to do a fake  setting the camera to default in obs makes it look like  size when i force it to  it seems to run at  very laggy pixel artifacts very hot after only a few minutes of use touch point for ring light doesnt work very well overall i feel ripped off this is a very cheaply made camera i would avoid at all costsnot  cheap missing parts avoid
3558,1,very disappointed the camera is great but i have no preview on my android phone  download does not work eitheri had to update the firmware manually from the sd cardwent on the support website but had no responseworks only as a stand alone camera
16855,5,gave as a giftgave it as a gift
450,1,i bought this to record music videos as well as take still photosi found out that the mov files that canon produces are unusable on apple and will not transfer unsupported file format the canon software will not transfer the files over wifithere are many technical discussions about this on various forums essentially you can jump through a bunch of hoops and use thirdparty software to create an applecompatible  file but its not easy or convenient i would never have purchased this product if i knew this in advance this is the last time i ever purchase a canon productvidoes are impossible to use on mac and iphone
2379,1,it took nice pictures no issues and then it started to sometimes take pictures and sometimes when i press the button it wont so i have to find a new camera nowstopped working
704,2,i like the size of the camera but the picture quality is not the bestbad picture quality
4833,1,this is more like a toy than a real camera i purchased it with film packs  some of which only had  prints in them  not the  advertised disappointing pictures are washed out  even with following instructions very carefully it is a waste of moneynot worth it
14246,5,ive never had a rice cooker before  really like itit cooks very nicely
6217,2,i have used it for a couple of days taking pictures at the water fall i used a towel to dry it after each use and hung out to dry i really like the design and how it protects the camera one thing that must improve is the clear plastic panel became foggy after about  months i washed it with water and then again with very light dish washing detergent no help now it it really hard to see the lcd and some camera controlsgood design but clear plastic panel needs to be better
10650,4,its cooks the rice ok dont like the design insidecute
364,1,my ten year old saved up her money to buy this we knew it was a kids camera but had no idea it would take such poor pictures think  year old flip phone picture quality even on the highest resolution settings with no shake the images are hazy at best definitely not as advertised my kid is happy for the novelty of it but the quality is just not here had we known we wouldnt have let her buy itterrible product
516,1,the camera stopped working after about a month doesnt turn on or off not responsive at all and it wasnt damaged or anything i bought it refurbished waste of moneythe camera stopped working after about a month doesnt 
7775,1,i bought three of these as gifts for christmas returning them all looks so cheap and poorly made i dont expect it to work at all also if you do decide to buy this camera you will need to also buy a chargeranother poor quality product from amazon
9781,5,i was skeptical of the benefits of cooking rice in a cooker vs on the stove but ive decided to try it in an effort to streamline my schedule and spend less time in the kitchen the instructions are simple and the cooker is easy to setup and use it works right of the box just rinse the cooker and accessories before use i have used this more since purchasing it than ive actually turned on my stove now ive expanded into preparing other rice based medley dishes as one dish meals i regret not trying this sooner i like the fact that the top does not seal completely i can open it and give it a quick stir or add other ingredients when making a mealthis little rice cooker is amazing
7182,1,thank god it was not in the middle of taking photos so i had a cap on my lens this strap came off from my wrist during my first use it has nice padding on the grip sure but if you want more secure wrist strap like i did do not choose this productstrap came off
15259,5,very useful producta good item to consider
1477,1,the camera doesnt come with a memory card you have to buy it separately the quailty of the pictures isnt the best but for the price its a decent cameradoesnt come with sd card
6212,2,it was too hard to get it on the camera correctly while in a hurry akawhen your outside and it starts to rain i returned iti returned it
6976,1,bought it for my girlfriends birthday took about  pictures and then a gear quit engaging near the lens googled it and apparently this is a common problem doing to send it back for warranty camera is pretty cheap if you can only take  pictures and it fails bad design if it is happening to different consumers regularly pain in the butt to have to print out all the forms and send it back and pay shipping i would recommend buying something other than a fuji instaxfailed almost immediately
6941,2,this camera is a lot bigger then i thought it would be but thats alright bad thing is the flash goes off all the timeso you cant take a picture thru a window because you will get a flash light and a spoiled pictureat a dollar a picpictures are not really sharp ok for kids so that is what i will do with minegive it to my granddaughterlot of people take shots of pics on the internet etcfacebookyoutube but you cant do that with this camera i would not buy againbuy a canon  zink cameraflash goes off all the time
5837,1,i have owned canon cameras for a long time but this one is horrible since you can not control the mode the camera is in your shots are at the mercy of the camera and to tell you the truth it only takes good pictures if the lighting is perfect one movement or low light situation and the pictures are grainy and blurryi would never buy this camera again i have been trying to return it even but they are saying i am past the return time this was a waste of almost  cameras for a long time but this one is horrible since you can not control the mode the

8661,1,this is a camera for kids no one can use this camera nothing works it starts with just opening the area to put in batteries it takes  men and a boy and then it is still hard finally opened it i can take pictures and then to delete them is virtually impossible i read manual and looked at reviews and everyone is totally unhappy with the camera it would do what i need but why do i have to fight every turnit sucks
4330,2,when i first got it it seemed a little smaller than i first anticipated however once i got all my gear in it everything seemed to have a place first few shots i took it on everything seemed to go smoothly it was the perfect bag that was until about a month of having i started to notice the material was coming apart the hole is getting bigger but ill use it until i cant any any more overall good bag just wish it was better qualitygood bag poor quality
16511,5,"this little guy has been greati am at around  pounds of rice through it now and that is a lot of  cup cookingone half measurei dont think it is made clear in the instructions do not add water until you add the rinsed rice if you add the water before the rice you are likely to boil over much easier although the rice will likely still cook fine small variations in water dont make a lot of difference unless you add too littlei have done quite a few full measure  cups of cooked rice cooking as well and i usually sit it on a coated paper plate in case it does boil over it has never made any big mess once i figured out to add water after the ricebest  bucks i ever spent on an appliance as it gets used a lot and it cooks perfect fluffy white rice every time "
6991,2,love this thing but after shooting only one roll it broke after amazons  day return so im in the process of contacting fuji hopefully they help out if not definitely a bummerwill fix this review if things get sorted outgreat camera if it works
7365,1,junk setting it up is time consuming to use poor body mechanics and its distorted waist of time and moneysave your money
459,1,terrible return process from amazon and camera is a piece of junkpoor camera and poor amazon return procedure
2686,2,i returned as it was smallest camera ever and decided my  year old would do better with a more advanced camera and last him longer honestly id say this camera is really only age appropriate for  year olds i would say this is just a play camera for littles dont expect and picture quality perhaps it serves a purpose for the wee littles but my  year old would advance out of it pretty quicksmallest camera ever
1072,1,terrible qualitymy iphone is  times better
4431,1,loved it at first but  months down the line the screen has one huge black half circle at the bottom right and one smaller one started on the bottom left for the price this was a waste expected to at least get a couple years out of it before it crapping out mom is in an retirement home and loves this thing ill have to try a different brand and see horrible for videos still photos look good minus the huge black spot on the bottom of every picture motion sensor works great and its pretty fast to respond ill upload pictures after my next  months old screen is dyeing
456,2,broke by itself in less then a year unreliable
8121,1,very unhappy with this camera ive had about  good photos out of  packs of film they all come out either blurry or over exposed or both ive looked up videos to see if its me but apparently is a common problem waste of money wish i had looked up reviews before buying 
1569,2,i could not figure out the focus function and it is not mentioned in the user manual i could not identify the minimum distance for taking a picturedoes not appear to have a focus function or cannot take close up picture
8229,1,using as a dashcam for the bike you think you are recording but its malfunctioned and is frozen early in the ride dont buy 
16209,4,"i bought the  rice cooker in  and im just throwing it out tonight i came to buy a new one but unfortunately it wasnt available in it held up well over the years with over  white rice cooks the nonstick finally started to wear out so i didnt think it was safe to use anymore pretty good purchase at  small rice cooker"
8855,1,you would have had to have an engineers degree to use it for advance photographer too slow in making pictures especially sports picturesit was slow making pictures
11931,5,this rice cooker is the best thing i have ordered for my kitchen it is  worth the money i recommend it to everyoneits worth the money
9462,4,love the low price since i purchased this rice cooker for my getaway apartment the description is accurate in that its a  rice cooker it it sure seems smaller that i remember my former small rice cookers though and when cooking a full pot the lid does allow splatter because i like to cook congee and other onepot meals in a rice cooker i wish i had bought a larger model but perhaps i will benefit from eating less when using it for the first time and only the first time despite washing the removable liner with warm soapy water as directed the unit did produce some fumes which i assumed were the manufacturing chemicals burning off but great to have a rice cooker at a lo price easy to clean and works fineworks fine good price small and splatters
11101,5,looking for a great rice cooker  well here it is i couldnt be more satisfied rice cooks great and its done so fast best buy everamazing
17628,5,"perfect rice every time  no matter what variety i cook a lot of indian  japanese food hence also a lot of rice to accompany the main dishes long grain basmati for indian short grain for sushi and other japanese dishesafter decades of using the  rice cookers and using my index finger to measure the water the results were usually acceptable but not perfect this unit takes the water estimating out of the picture as the  menu settings for long grain brown  sushishort grain are mirrored inside the bowl with the precise measurements noted on the inside of the bowl based on how much rice youve put in the results are perfection every time  regardless of varietyalthough triple the cost of the bargain units we were using for years this unit has elevated our cuisine and is well worth the priceperfect rice every time"
13092,5, first time using a rice cooker so i cant compare but this is amazing it looks very fancy with the touch screen  and it came with instructions  the rice spoon measurement cup and some recipes  im very very happy with itreally nice
3829,2,not the best photo quality not the easiest to figure outnot a fan
4224,2,definitely not what i expectednone of us could figure it out even reading the tiny directions it was too smallit is definitely not worth the moneytoo small too complicated
8304,1,item arrived dirty with box previously opened and appeared to be already used i bought this camera as a birthday present for my daughter very disappointedused item buyer beware
13753,4,"there is a bit of a learning curve with this cooker even as someone that has used one beforei read a number of reviews here about people burning their rice mine didnt come out burnt the first few times but it got close after reading more literature i realized two things although it says a minimum of one cup for white rice it really works better with a minimum of two for sweet rice it is definitely a minimum of two it is required that you presoak your rice for thirty minutes prior to cooking i have always rinsed my rice but was not accustomed to having to do this with an automatic cooker i believe this cooker gets a lot hotter than cheaper ones and thats why this step is importantlastly this is one that i already knew but for newbies its important to rinse your rice until the water runs clear or at least close to it for me i do this in a bowl rather than in a colander under a continuous stream and it takes about  or  rinsesif you follow the proper steps this works just fine the non stick coating has held up well for me so far and thats the main improvement over my last cheapie rice cookerbeware user error"
11534,5,small but enough for  maybe  peopleits beautiful
13437,5,even though it looks simplistic and basic it makes one of the best steamed rice highly recommend it 
14078,5,"my kids bought this for their dad for his birthday because he does the cooking and he was tired of our rice cooker glitching recently hes kind of a clean freak so he loved that the inner top lid can be removed to clean and that the steam vent collector can also be taken apart the quick cook button wasnt as great as being smart with getting the rice to be not too wet the regular cook option was perfect and it does take about  minutes but he was fine with that the quick is good if you are in a real hurry  min and dont mind the rice being just a little not quite righthave used it for about  weeks now so far so goodhusband loves his birthday gift"
14426,5,thanks for such an amazing item the quick cook feature is great quick shippingthe best rice cooker
2693,1,my  year old loved this camera but used it infrequently on trips yesterday she was using it and it suddenly froze and wouldnt turn off or reset it simply stuck with the same picture on the screen then we let the battery die and recharged it but no luck it wont turn on we also tried plugging it into a different cable but no luck sad to have it dieworked at first but stopped suddenly
13142,4,not badrice cooker
10333,5,works goodprice is right
4382,1,the three radio stations i was interested in would not play pixstar support said its license or incompatibility based which cannot be true those where all normal  without playback licensense restrictions no way to troubleshoot no way to add urls for other radio stations keeping a long list of radio stations of which many wont work is  usb keyboards did not worki could not get a samba file share to workthere is no webserver on the device itself you have to use the cloud and you can not do all configs from cloud so still necessary to do most configs via remote or if youre lucky usb keyboardbeware that resetting the frame will not erase locally stored pictures i overwrote local storage with empty files to ensure no personal data was left on frame before returning ityou can not delete the cloud account be sure to replace any personal email or other info from cloud account before returning a frame difficulttoo many software issues for me
6970,2,i had the fuji instax wide  for several years and was ready for an upgrade i purchased the  model right before going on vacation got  days of use out of it before it broke i will be returning it for a replacement it took some great photos before it broke read several reviews on other sites other people seem to have the same problemworked great for a few days then broke
3887,1,horrible quality for how expensive it is lots of problems with it from film getting jammed to each time you try to fix the jam it prints out an empty picture a pack of  film cost  not happy at alldisappointing
6718,2,this bag is good for holding multiple items on the go for a long shoot day or travel day its a good backpack for the airport etc but the material feels cheap and collects a lot of dust dog hair pollen dirt etc and it shows up on the bag the straps are not comfortable at all overall a solid bag to get the job done but i often switch to different camera bags when this bag easily gets dirty or when i know im going to shoot for long periods of timecool looking bag but uncomfortable and cheap materials
4716,1,my  year old daughter received the unicorn camera as a gift for christmas the camera has been used periodically since but yesterday we tried to take photos nothing will happen no exposure when trying to view past pictures we cannot click through them the camera also will not print it also struggles to turn on i tried charging it fully and still nothing for  and only in use since december  this is beyond disappointing for me as well as my daughterit was a huge hit the instant capabilities to print were exactly what i knew she would lovestopped working
1002,2,do not buy this camera in the product description it does not say the camera requires an external memory card i could not get the memory card that this camera uses i am now stuck this useless item because i forgot to return in timeread this first
16848,5,design is good and has all required functions taste good but only downside is quick cook still takes longgood rice cooker for the price
8832,2,if you only take away one thing from this review it should be that the new polaroid film always develops much too dark you are way better off going with one of the many fuji instax cameras and their far superior film im a fan of the square versionive been taking pictures for quite some time and have shot using all sorts of film including   the old kodak disc film medium format kodak instant the original polaroid  and spectra films aps fuji instax etc and of course tons of digital cameras more recently ive also developed my own film and made my own prints back in the day before we had the magic of digital i mention these things because i feel like i have at least some knowledge of how cameras and film should worklets go over a few things about the polaroid go camera first and then ill explain why you shouldnt buy itin the boxin the box youll find the camera itself a strap a usba to microusb cable for charging the builtin battery a quick start guide and some stickers in this particular package you will also get  packs of film each containing  exposuresdesignthe camera looks like a smaller version of the standard size polaroid cameras it is by no means tiny by todays standards but it is small compared to other polaroid cameras and will fit in your hand although definitely not in your pocketthe camera has a door on the bottom that flips open to reveal the film chamber you can also see the large mirror inside when you open the door so youll want to make sure not to touch it or allow dust insidethe left side of the camera has the microusb port for charging along with a led to indicate the charging status and battery levelon the back is the optical viewfinder a slot for the strap the power button and a small led display which indicates the number of remaining exposures the flash status and other informationup top are the red shutter release button and a flash button which is used to control the flash selftimer and double exposure modethe front of the camera has the flash with exposure sensors and a led underneath the main lens and the lens for the viewfinder which doubles as a selfie mirror with its faint reflective coating there is also the film slot where your photos will ejectsetupgetting the camera ready for use is easy plug it into any usb port no charger is included charge it up until the light is green and then load some film the film is easy to load and simply drops into the bottom of the camera there are indicators on the film back and inside the camera to help you line up the film cartridge correctlyonce youre charged up and have film loaded youre ready to take picturesin useto turn the camera on simply hold the power button for a moment the display on the rear of the camera will light up showing how many exposures you have left and a small dot will blink and then become solid to show that the flash is charged and ready for useby default the camera will always fire the flash if you want to turn it off you can press the flash button for about a secondif you want to use the selftimer you can hold down the flash button for  seconds an orange led below the flash on the front of the camera will light up to show that the camera is in selftimer mode when you push the shutter release in this mode youll have  seconds to get in position before the photo is takenthe camera also features a doubleexposure mode which allows you to expose the same film frame twice for creative effects to put the camera in this mode you doubletap the flash button once you are in the double exposure mode youll see the number  flashing in the display to indicate that you are on the first of the two exposures once you take the first exposure the display will change to a flashing number  once you take the second exposure the film will be ejected as usualperformancetheres no other way to say it the new polaroid film is absolutely terrible not only does the film take  minutes to develop hardly instant but once it is fully developed it is extremely underexposed every photo i took with this camera came out much too dark ive attached several samples to this review my digital camera actually made them appear a little lighter than they really are and yet they still look dark all photos were taken outside in very bright sunlight but not pointed at the sun or inside within  feet of the subject with the flash onive had the larger new polaroid cameras and experienced the exact same thing with their larger film format as well so i dont see how it could be any issue with the particular camera i received unless all their cameras have an issue and underexpose the film the photos come out so dark that they are actually unusable and i have to say that both the camera and the film which is quite expensive for such a tiny image are a complete waste of money ive used all  formats of the fuji instax films and all of them produce results that are far better than these new polaroid filmsbottom line do yourself a favor and avoid all the new polaroid products if you are interested in old school instant photography you will get much more enjoyment and better results using the fuji instax productsall photos too dark get fuji instax instead
6731,1,it is missing two zipper rings when i riceived the bag which i am looking forward to a  bag should have better quality doesnt it disappointmissing two zipper rings
13237,1,"this cooker is the worst i have usedboils out on counter every time no matter how small the batchboils over every time"
6578,1,very very disappointed in image quality images are blurry fuzzy and not vivid or crisp pales in comparison to a smart phone camera tried several things but still the same result almost to the extent that i think the particular camera we received must have a defect or was just a dudimage quality bad
9820,4,i purchased this as an open box used item for a considerable discount the product itself works great but of course box was beat up and items like the instruction manual spoon and measuring cup were not included i probably could have found this at a thrift store in the same condition for less not unhappy with purchase but will be more mindful of buying such open box items in future i do like and appreciate the ability to return for a refund tho i am satisfied with the item since it does do the job i was looking for it to doopen box used item
9062,2,the film came damaged i took  photos and all the pictures developed weird it was a waste of my money can someone please reach out  thankfilm damage

271,1,we purchased a new camera and received a used camera the outside of the camera appeared to have some sort of sun damage i mentioned this when we sent the product back as soon as we received it not cool considering the pricedefected product received
314,2,bought this through amazon in  after  years it is nearly unusable the unit has been treated very tenderly as its the most expensive camera ive purchased never been dropped or gotten wet but functions began to fail after  yearsinitially there was a flaw in the images as the left upper and lower corners of some images displayed some sort of lens flaw shadowing the corners see photo having to take a family trip and enamored of the other features i decided i could fix the flaws by cropping the images on the computer i was able to live with this flawi also discovered that the lowlight capabilities of this camera were pretty awful but as  of my requirements were for outdoor use this was not a huge problem for methis past year the autofocus has started to fail when zooming either in or out while recording video the video becomes completely unfocused only regaining focus about a second after the zoom has finished this makes video of action such as at ball games etc essentially unwatchable this started earlier this year and has been getting worse and worse with time this failure is one i cannot work around or live withi was very hopeful for this camera as it has an excellent feature set but if i had known that i would only be getting  years of use from this camera i never would have purchased it im writing this review because i am now looking for a new camera to replace this one i will be looking at manufacturers other than panasonic because of the problems ive had with the quality of this model as well as the the comments ive since read from others who have also experienced quality problems with panasonicvery disappointedgreat features poor quality very disappointed
1775,2,somehow after using only a couple times it broke already not broke broke like it just doesnt work and the pictures wont come out whats interesting is before this happen first time trying it out the picture got stuck in so many timewasnt too bad
6332,1,weve been through two of these since december and they both just quit printing they are too expensive to quit working so fast very sad child  
4730,1,quality of printed picture is horrible prints way too dark cant hardly make out what the picture was returning it asapupon further inspection this camera came to us used no extra print rolls and no lanyard strap for camera also seller didnt even bother to check if the camera was cleaned out of pics so my daughter found pictures on her camera of complete strangers not goodterrible print
10543,5,this thing is a life changer if you eat rice a lotamazing
16876,5,i like the outlook of this rice cooker very nice design most of time i only use it for white rice cook with sticky function but the flavor just ok didnt impress me other brands like zojirushi toshiba or tiger have a better performance in this price range all those japanese brand may not have a good shape but the taste of the rice is much better than this onenot bad but may have more choice on this price range
4648,2,only worked for about  months i contacted ugreen directly for it to be covered under their  month manufacturer warranty and they referred me back to amazon which refers me to their website seems like theyre not willing to do right by their warrantyworked fine for about  months then stopped working
7769,2,this product is super cheaply made and really hard to navigatecheap chinese made
12827,5,ive had this product about a week now and i love the way it cooks oatmeal and rice timer is easy to program and automatically adjusts based on how much im cooking it has yet to overcook anything the top lid is easy to remove simply press the orange button there appears to not be a separate removable steam cap so it appears the manual needs to be updated ill update this review as i use the cooker moreno more burnt rice or oatmeal
1156,1,product doesnt work simply just sits on welcome screendoesnt work at all
13936,5,i like to cook my rice in a pot on the stove top easy peasy but i have always wanted to try rice porridge however the llloooong method was a bit much for just me so i purchased this little beauty and am now enjoying it  times a week i am a happy camperrocks
4396,1,this review is for the pixstar  inch wifi digital picture framei used this frame in the simplest possible way inserted an sd card with photos on it and let the frame display them randomly i did not even bother connecting to wifithe frame worked great for a couple of weeks i wished the display had a higher resolution but the frame was was easy to set up and use and i was quite happy with it at that point i would have given it  starsthen the frame began intermittently displaying noise see photo this condition rapidly worsened over about  hours to the point where it almost always displayed only noise i tried onoff power cycle removing the sd card nothing fixed the issue critical failureworked great for a couple or weeks then stopped working
2945,2,play video i purchased these in bulk because i do a little scrapbooking when i travel it took me a few months to get to all the cartridges but when i tried to use this one it did not work when i pulled it out of the printer this is what i found all of the cartridges worked except for this one there is no way to contact the seller to get a replacement because it is past my return time so i am basically out the cost of one of these expensive cartridges and have no retribution so just be aware if you were going to purchase these in a lot use them all before the end of your return in case one doesnt worksome cartridges dont worknow that it is past time to return
10454,5,this is exactly what i had been looking for and even more than i expected originally i just wanted it for ramen so i wouldnt have to use a pot that was too big that was the first thing i did make and its a learning curve the noodles were the best i ever had but never came to a boil saved the extra broth that i made with bone broth concentrate and mrs dash table blend after dinner i decided i would make breakfast put the pot in the fridge and see how long it took to reheat on warm in the morning i used the leftover broth pearl couscous frozen cooked chicken breast and kale i tasted it and oh my goodness and theres just enough no more leftovers unless i want there to be already thinking of all the things i can have now and it is a game changer for me as a single seniorperfect for  person
2513,1,i would leave zero stars if possible i am beyond upset i purchased this as a gift and when i opened the package there was no camera i now i have to be inconvenienced by returning the item and because i no longer have trust in on arriving to me safely i have to go purchase one from the store this was extremely upsettingmissing camera
6000,2,i purchased a gopro hero  in sept  in may of  i took the device in the river while on a hike water leaked into the battery area the device stopped working i called customer support who said the warranty has expired must be  month warranty and because i had not purchased their subscription there was nothing that could be done lesson dont take your go pro in the water without a case despite the claims of being water resistant they suggested i was responsible for making sure the device door was clear of debris  thanks gopro 
9909,5,we had a few other rice makers in the past and they have not stood the test of time this one so far is different its nice not having a separate lid to clean and only having the pot to wash does a great job of making good rice that doesnt come out burnt on the bottom its a great brand and it works well for oatmeal and short grain rice as well highly recommendthe best rice maker ive ever owned
8803,1,the photos either come out too bright too dark or too blurry plus the film itself is quite small i suggest a fujifilm camera insteadcute but not quality
2547,1,we are one day outside of the return window and he camera has started printing with lines on the photos i took it it apart with a micro screwdriver and tried to clean what i could and it still printing with lines see photoprints with lines after  month
2118,1,my camera stopped working after only  pictures so sad terriblesecond film and camera doesnt work any more
5325,1,literally worked for  weeks now one of lights are flashing orange and youtube says it needs repairs literally money in the trashonly lasted  weeks
1408,1,very very cheaply made an takes horrible photosvery very unsatisfied returning mondayhorrible
15888,5,its a nice design with this priceso good in this price
3694,2,the lighting unit was good but the battery only lasted maybe  hr  min at minimum setting  brightness the battery came fully chargedafter the battery was used up the charger could not charge the battery again although the battery charger showed a green light indicating it was fully chargedhad to return the light due to the battery problemcould not recharge battery
6430,1,not worth the money battery gos dead in  min video quality is horrible sound stutterswaste of money
14446,5,my new favorite kitchen gadget perfectly cooked rice and every time and i dont have to keep an eye on it i bought it because of product tests and reviews i found online and it lives up to every review so glad i purchased this rice cookerim in love
17320,5,i previously tried a cheap tiger rice cooker it did a great job dont get me wrong i ended up deciding i wanted one with the gaba setting since we eat a lot of brown rice ive only used this for two meals so far but i love it already the bowl is much nicer and thicker i can tell it will last the parts are easy to take out and wash which is a plus but most importantly the food is steaming hot when you open the lid and very consistent throughout to me it worth the extra cost because i plan on having this machine for years to comeheavy duty amazing rice cooker
5316,1,we were so excited to gift this to our daughter for her birthday we started unboxing and realized we were missing the film she was so disappointed and so were we an instant camera is no good without film thats also about  bucks worth of our package that was just straight up missing i cant figure out how to get customer service to fix it in a straightforward way either they try to send you to the the manufacturer or have you return everything just send me my film pleasemissing filmthe second most expensive part
14435,5,"i was able to set the rice cooker up in minutes then place my first  cups of daipoong gold riceand presto in  minutes quick cook mode i was able to have an excellent rice bowlthe standard cooking mode is  minutes and rice comes out with more moisture and softness like a bowl of rice my mom would makeits just the right size with a maximum of  cups i even made some rice porridge to bootim sure i will continue to make all kinds of wonderful dishes of delight with this portable cookercreates delicious white rice in just  minutes"
5996,1,the gopro  screen has a glitch  look for yourself by searching gopro  screen unresponsive in google mine is so bad i cant even connect the camera to the iphone app for a firmware update which by the way does not totally correct the problem if you read the comments do not buy a gopro  screen an ongoing issue with this model
2013,1,the product was defective the film arrived damaged and the pictures were very blurrydarkblurry film
9454,5,very high tech love itgreat
10661,4,the measuring cup included is nice the lid being able to be stored on the handle while items are pulled from the cooking bowl is very nice also it is worth noting that adding the lid to the cooking area to allow the thermal transfer to cook is very cool it simply means if the lid is off the food probably is not directly cookingthe small things matter alot
10451,5,cant beat the functionality you get for the low price an excellent first rice cookerdoes what it needs to do
237,2,i returned this camera after  day of use the sensor in this camera is only slightly larger than whats in an iphone so low light photos are terrible for the price i expected much better image quality the video quality is very good and takes very smooth high quality movies but thats not the main reason i made this purchase the build quality is acceptable kinda light and plastic feeling and the smaller size felt awkward in my average size male handsback to the image quality the photos look pretty good until you want to crop an image even in outdoor full light even just a  crop shows noise and digital noise around the edges of objects indoors with filtered sun light has even worse noise the auto settings bump the iso way too high so the noise is terrible but i believe you can set a max iso but the average user isnt going to know this my other cameras are a canon  and  that i use for studio work etc and i understood that this could not hold a candle to that image quality but i bought this for a walking around camera for family pictures etc which for the most part it would have been ok but for the price i expected much better you might as well stick with a phone camera or a much cheaper and smaller point and shoot thats fits in your pocket the only thing this does better is optical zoom and thats why i returned it maybe my expectations were too high for a point and shoot but again for the price it just wasnt worth it to me since for another hundred bucks you can get a canon rebel which takes substantially better photos i also didnt like the electronic view finder felt like i was standing too close to a tv with my eye a dslr view finder is much betterclearer in my personal opinionim not sure who this camera is intended for anyone that knows how to use cameras and values image quality and does any post processing wont be happy and point and shoot users should save some money and would do better with a smaller pocket size point and shoot like the canon  that you just turn to auto and shoot awaydecent until you want to crop a photo not worth the price
5131,1,this camera had no dicots pictures were blurry this camera had no focus
6302,2,unfortunately i have to say that im pretty disappointed with my purchase the camera is cheaply made and does not perform wellfirstly the image quality is subpar the camera produces grainy and blurry images which is disappointing considering that its a digital camera the colors are also washed out and not true to lifethe cameras build quality is also lacking it feels flimsy and cheaply made and i worry about how long it will last the buttons are stiff and unresponsive making it difficult to adjust settings quicklythe cameras user interface is confusing and difficult to navigate its not intuitive and i found myself struggling to figure out how to adjust basic settings like the flash and timerfinally the cameras battery life is abysmal i had to replace the batteries multiple times during a short photo shoot which is unacceptableoverall i regret purchasing this offbrand digital camera its image quality is subpar the build quality is lacking the user interface is confusing and the battery life is abysmal if youre looking for a quality digital camera i would recommend looking elsewherei would avoid this
3813,1,i bought this in november for my daughter for her birthday when i took it out of the box and placed the sd card in it it states there is a card error we are unable to use this at all i have tried several sd cards i am very unhappy about it and she is so disappointeddid not work oiut of the box
7813,1,it was a giftgift
3962,1,we have gone through two of these and they both just randomly stop workingstop working
8838,2,it would not take acceptable pictures darklight changing conditions and blur on longer zoom light and with red easy to find and carr wanted it to work but it just did not perform well when neededpoor in confused light conditions
5333,1,followed all of the instructions camera did not work at allabsolute waste of money garbage
2439,2,i was really disappointed with this camera and found that my android phone is much better this is like a camera i had almost  years ago the quality is bad and blurry and doesnt reflect the ads at all the menus and buttons are so frustrating and complicated that i wouldnt call this a beginner camera for teens eithergood camera back in 
2581,2,the button is very difficult to use half the time it does not work it is very frustrating i wish i could return it it was alot of money for something that only works for  of the photos you want to take i thought the film counter was broken and it was just out of film but it wasnt and i ended up wasting a bunch of filmhard to use wastes film
10064,5,"i bought this aroma brand rice cooker to replace a larger vegetable steamer by a different manufacturer that had an attachment for cooking rice i wanted to have a cooker that was primarily for rice with the option to steam vegetables andor cook other foods while being smaller when stored on the countertop and easier to clean than my old one based on other amazon reviews i selected this onebefore i forget to write it i think it is important to point out that this cooker is rated for  cups of cooked rice not  cups of uncooked rice the usual ratio for regular white rice is  meaning that if you put in  cup of uncooked rice you will have  cups of cooked rice when done so with this product you can put in a maximum of  cups of uncooked rice and will end up with a maximum of  cups of cooked riceit is also important to note that if you choose to use the optional included vegetable steamerfood cooker tray this fits inside the rice cooker pot and therefore takes up some of the space in that pot you can cook rice and steam vegetablescook food simultaneously but you cannot fit the full measure of rice when doing so in my estimate if you put in a cup or two of uncooked rice the vegetable steamerfood cooker tray holds about enough to feed two people when combined with the rice it is certainly not large enough to simultaneously cook rice and other food in quantities for a family aroma makes a similar product with a larger capacity if you need iti shopped in several stores sears bed bath  beyond target macys before buying this cooker they all carried electric rice cookers but none had this product sears has aroma products but only in a less expensive nondigital version while bbb had a similar cooker by west bend that did not look as good in terms of quality but the majority of places i looked carried only nondigital rice cookers i mention this because i think the digital ones have a couple of advantages that are significant enough to comment on the cooker is not simply based on cooking time there is some sort of measurement going on that assures properly cooked rice the cooker can be programmed to start cooking while you are away so that the rice or other food will be ready when you want to eat it the cooker automatically goes into a keep warm mode once cooking is done and will work well in this regard for at least a few hoursthis cooker includes the following cooker itself included the digital controller and the heating element teflon coated nonstick rice cooker pot plastic vegetable steamerfood cooker tray plastic stirring spatula used once rice is cooked clear plastic measuring cup  cup capacity users manual quick start guide rice recipesbasic rice cooking goes like this measure uncooked rice using included cup or any other measuring cup pour rice into pot if cooking white rice pour in some water stir with included spatula or wooden spoon etc drain water this optional step helps rinse away excess starch add water to pot which already contains rice until water level reaches measuring mark on inside of pot that corresponds with amount of rice close cooker lid press power button press either the white rice or brown rice button cooking starts and is monitored by the digital controller display shows rotating led pattern cooking led illuminates when digital controller estimates that about  minutes remain display stops rotating pattern and starts showing count down minutes until done cooker beeps loudly for a few seconds automatically enters keep warm mode keep warm led illuminates when ready to eat press power button twice to turn cooker off open lid and remove pot stir cooked in pot using included spatula or wooden spoon etcthe manual includes a chart for estimating cooking time but in general white rice takes  minutes and brown rice takes twice that timei have done small and large batches of both white rice brown rice and also a batch of wild rice and all came out perfectly properly cooked but not mushy white rice had a nice level of stickiness of the sort that lends itself to eating with chopsticks but without being too sticky so you can easily break it up by stirring more with the spatulain my tests i always used the recommended water amount ie i filled the pot to the measurement line that matched the amount of uncooked rice i put in except for the wild rice the cooker does not have a setting for wild rice so i followed the instructions on the rice bag putting in  cup of water for each cup of uncooked rice and then using the brown rice mode on the cookeri have not used the optional vegetable steamerfood cooker tray so i cannot comment on that very much but the manual includes extra steps for setting up cooking in the tray only ie no rice cooking as well as simultaneous cooking of rice and other foods there are ways to specify time values that apply to the foods in the optional tray so the cooker is not going only on its normal method for riceonly cookingbesides using the product for cooking rice and other things in the optional tray it can be used as a sort of crock pot for heating soups chili stews etc in this case you just put the food to be heated into the pot directly and select the white rice mode the food will be heated and then the cooker will keep it warm until you are ready to eat it i tested this using a can of chili and it worked well this use of the cooker is mostly useful if you want to program it to start cooking while you are away with cooking completed soon before you are ready to eat or to keep the food warm if you are uncertain about when you will be ready to eatthe pot is easy to clean since neither water or food are ever put into the body of the cooker there should rarely be any need to clean it other than wiping the inside of the lid in case any food splashed up onto it during cookingthe quality of this product seems very good nothing feels cheap my only quibbles are that the power cord is quite short obviously intended for use on a counter top whereas i prefer to use it on a table that is further from the nearest outlet and the control panel area is quite reflective and sometimes i have to view from different angles in order to read the buttons andor the display and other ledsabove average rice cooker"
9742,5,these are great for the price im on my second one now had my first one for years and years and used it several times per week this newer version has even more features and they all work great its so much more than a rice cooker the slow cooker function works well and you can even brown a chuck roast in it before adding your liquid makes perfect hard or soft boiled eggs steams vegetable well cook rice and steam broccoli and salmon all at once money very well spent if you use all the features it even has a setting to cook boxed cake but havent ever tried itgreat for the price
13517,5,"i love the simplicity of the  it just works while it might not make  rice like newer aifueled technocookers do i didnt hesitate to repurchase it when it was time to retire my first a bangedup model i saved from the amazon warehouse and used at least twice a week for over seven yearsi hate the idea of a dedicated device taking up space in my cabinet or on my countertop  and to be fair these can do more than cook rice  but i will always make an exception for the nhs all i want it to do is make rice and it does it just works hopefully its still being manufactured when i need my next replacementstill the best"
2326,2,well when my boyfriend first bought me the camera for christmas my birthday i loved it i used it only  times then the night of my baptism which was last month i was going to use the camera and couldnt for some reason for some reason the camera wouldnt turn on unless plugged in so i couldnt use it for my baptism which i was very very sad about now i cant use it again today this is soooo sad and frustrating for me idk if its the battery or the device its selfcamera
1056,1,the advertisement says that the camera comes with a sd memory card not in the box extra expense ughno sd card included
1986,2,i think this will be the first bad review i have ever given i am extremely disappointed in this camera i knew that the photos would not be as good as my sony camera that has a san disc card but i only wanted this camera in order to take pictures of my ceramic art work the pictures were to be used as a reference to what glazes were used and what cones the pieces were fired to etc i just got the camera yesterday i have taken two pictures so far and both are a joke the color is not good on either one fortunately for me i can make out what the picture is of i guess i will just waste the other film trying to take a better picture of the same ceramic piece hoping to get a useable one i had wanted to keep this camera in my studio and take quick pictures for reference but the quality is so bad that it wont work for me sorry for this negative review but it is what it is i also purchased more film that will arrive tomorrow ill be returning it as i dont plan on keeping this camera a day care center where little ones can play with it might be a better place for itvery disappointing
1734,1,this camera is possibly good for a childs first ever camera although i truly think there is better out there for even that we tried this camera out because we are on a budget and wanted to take pictures of our trip during our visit to yellowstone we wanted a camera because it may be easier to print out photos from it turns out my iphone  camera blows it out of the water even my significant others iphone se was better than this i am not impressed honestly do more research on some other options if you are looking for a budget friendly cameranot good
659,2,it may be prettyto look at but i dont like this camera its outdated everything about it is like a camera from early digital days late   the screen and writing are too small that  claim also written on the device is just a ploy my phone takes better pictures it is not userfriendlydont bother
17597,5,"so i didnt see it mentioned but something i was worried about was the power consumption i have a device to measure the watt usage over time so i tested both my rice cookersmy old rice cooker was a cheap single hotplate style one with a single pushdown button and a  minute cooktime and aluminum bowl it would use about  kwh for  cup of ricethe zojirushi  cooking  cup of rice over the course of an hour cooktime uses about  kwhso about  more efficient i guess and better tasting rice at the end of the day if the  premium is worth it to you is up to you but just know that it doesnt use more power and in fact it might use a bit less then the cheap competitionif you dont cook much rice and dont really care about the better consistency its hard to recommend this mainly because of the long cook timepower consumption is great"
14837,4,love this havent had a rice cooker in years but finally got this one the only thing to note is that it doesnt turn off automatically you have to time your rice small price to pay for this rice cooker with a small price tagsmall but mighty
2565,1,after one day it will not charge my daughter loved it but we are now stuck since it was purchased as a gifttoo late to returnwont charge
7468,2,i bought this camera to use as a helmetcam when riding my motorcycles i figured i may end up with another camera on the bars so i decided to see if something inexpensive would be of satisfactory output quality and thereby save a lot of money the camera comes with an impressive number of accessories a waterproof housing etc and even two batteries with a charging caddy i was impressedbut sadly the video quality is only barely acceptable ive been recording in  and it looks pretty dang bad blocky and too contrasty out of camera definitely does not look highdef in the least the stabilization is unimpressive  practically nonexistent maybe it doesnt work at  which makes this camera a waste of money out the gateso far this is not too terribly shy of my expectations since its a cheap camerabut worse to use it helmetmounted on a motorcycle one really needs to use the app thats because its very difficult to see if the camera is recording or even on when its mounted to the chin of a helmet so the app is easy enough to hook up you get a remote view of what the camera sees and it has a startstop recording button excellent except it continually disconnects and you wont notice because youve probably switched to your nav app and when it disconnects it stops the camera recording and seems to even turn off the camera or more likely the autosleep kicks in so to start recording again you have to turn the camera on reconnect to its wifi etc etc all either fumbling with gloves on or by pulling over or worse fooling around at a stop light taking your gloves off etc to get things going again in other words it is untrustworthy and therefore unusable for longterm andor handsoff recordinggiven that even though the video is barely acceptable at the price its still not a good bargain i ended up sucking it up and just buying the real thing gopro hero  thats what i should have done from the start as they say buy once cry once why do i keep forgetting that lessonnot usable for handsoff activities such as motovlogging etc
14843,5,i recently purchased this and i must say it has exceeded my expectations with its automatic keep warm feature i no longer have to worry about my rice getting cold its incredibly versatile allowing me to make not only perfect fluffy rice but also delicious soups stews and hot cereals effortlessly the capacity is perfect for my small family and its easy to clean the cooking time for certain grains is slightly longer than expected overall a fantastic addition to my kitchengreat
437,1,i took about  pictures and the camera died  the battery was fully charged and it wouldnt come on at all took the battery out and put it back in and it still wouldnt work this was all done within a  day time period after receiving the camera i have had a sony and minolta cameras forever just wanted to see how different the canon camera was compared to my cameras i found out within a weeks time i have over  pictures in my collection with both prints and digital the rest of the cameras i liked was all over  which i cannot pay that much for a camera thanks for all your help in returning this camera packagefinding a camera that works 
9101,1,i purchased this film and im not sure if its outdated or what but the pics are faint and not good at all we had a special for pics with the easter bunny and the pics are horrible what a waste of  waste the money
2112,1,the camera arrived broken it seems it turns on but it does not print i tried to ask for a refund or replacement but amazon did not refund me or replace the itemarrived broken
5090,1,bought this thinking it should have decent picture quality but it was not very good and the zoom was awful ended up returning it i noticed many of the great reviews come from people who were given the camera for free definitely not worth the pricenot the best quality
5492,1,pictures are not very sharp but the most annoying thing is that its easy to put the camera into some special mode and hard to figure out how to get out of it first i accidentally turned on a  mode which captures multiple pictures i went through all the menus to figure out what it was and then finally went to youtube and found that it is a special button on top then i wanted to use this camera at a dance performance and again it went into a different multi shot mode and i could not take any pictures youtube again and found it was bracketing the led display is very hard to decipher with symbols and abbreviations as far as i could tell there was no reset button that would turn off any special features after this experience i just returned the camerabad design camera gets stuck in odd modes pictures not sharp
5489,1,this camera is terrible i wish i had never bought it it takes great pictures when you are outside and it is sunny other than that most pictures are garbage ive read the instructions numerous times ive watched youtube videos on how to use this camera as far as i can tell i am doing everything right but the pictures still come out blurry not very sharp and the camera doesnt capture colours well i am not a professional but i know how to take pretty decent pictures my cell phone takes better pictures than this cameraive had this camera for just over a year and it has started to give me an error message when i use the zoom there is no rhyme or reason as to when this message will show up i could use it all day without getting the message then the next day i get it every time i use the zoom ive searched online and this seems to be a common problem i wish i had known that before buying itthere are a few good things about this camera the video quality is pretty good the zoom when it works and can focus properly and you are outside and it is sunny is amazing if you plan to use this only for videos or outside on sunny days this is the camera for you otherwise do not buy this camera it will be a waste of moneyperfect for sunny days but not much else
8927,1,camera wont charge will not hold a charge tried different cords different boxes different plug ins seller requires everything including packaging back and i dont have it all i better get a refundcamera wont charge
7752,1,not worth a dollar after giving my daughter the gift she dreamt about she was only able to take pictures three times till the camera broke with zero explanation  zero help to fix it would not advise anyone to buy this crap its worthless amazon should take the item off its salesdo not buy
3357,1,i do not recommend this camera picture quality  cheapbad quality
16222,5,everything about it is good i really like it works really wellvery good and useful
7178,2,as far as i know i didnt do anything wrong my camera can be pretty heavy but of course it depends on what lens im using i never held it by just the strap always made sure my hand was secured on the actual camera as to not put unnecessary stress on the strap itself after only a few months of having it really only shooting with it on a few occasions the stitches in it broke thankfully i didnt drop my camera its a decent product and i enjoyed it mostly but maybe buy a different one if youre looking for something more sturdyi loved it until it broke
16,5,i got this charger because i was sick if trying to plug my iphone cable into my phone past a thick otter box i would suggest if you are one to watch a lot of youtube videos youll want a  foot cable but this works greatsmall learning curve but great product
15503,4,this moosum electric rice cooker with onetouch for asian japanese sushi rice   cooked fast  convenient cooker with ceramic nonstick inner pot stainless steel housing and auto warmer is super simple to use i loved that simple ratios for cooking ricewater are right on the pot practically foolproof i also like that the housing is stainless steel not plastic one touch operation and clear lid makes my rice and other grains such as oatmeal easy i can start this and get on with other parts of my meal without having to pay attention to possibly burning my rice clean up is easy allow pot to cool and a quick hand wash i also love the small footprint for enough rice for six people color is nice little perk i removed one star because this would have been complete with a small vegetable steamer basket it isnt a deal breaker see my picturessuper simple
5044,1,the lens stopped closing when camera was off so i had to return itnot working
3911,1,i bought this as a gift a month ahead of time to make sure i didnt forget and because there was a discounted one since it said it was a damaged package upon arrival i checked the box and it looked fine so i gifted it big mistake it had been opened and put back nearly in the box one if the films had been used completely and the second was already in the camera it didnt work i assumed changing the film would fix the problem but only  picture came out right and after they all came out black weve changed the films again and same thing  picture is fine then all the rest are black i read and re read the instructions my husband also did i couldnt return it so im stuck with something that doesnt workunfortunately this did not work

9371,5,i ordered this after a failed attempt at replacing my old rice cooker we had it for years but it had been discontinued other two other ones that just didnt live up to are unbelievable high rice cooking standards  like cooking rice we ordered this one and have loved every minute of it we only ordered it for its size but live all the added functionality that actually works most by in my bookgreat rice and more cooker
2386,2,i first ordered this project as a gift upon them opening it we couldnt get the film to print the orange light wouldnt stop blinking even after trying new packages of film changing the batteries and resetting it after hearing this is a notsouncommon defect i sent it out for return and ordered a new one new one came fast and works like a charm we love it no issues and it looks super cute however now its been over  months and my return still hasnt processed am i ever going to get my  backgreat product bad return

3950,1, ive had camera for less than a month after a few times i used it it started flashing i googled the reasons why is was flashing like that but it wasnt because of none of them it just randomly started doing that and it wont let me take any pictures dont get thisbad
8247,2,it is so cute which is why i bought itnot thinking it through with ipads and cell phones which are made easy to use this was more difficult to learn to usenot worth the money
8451,1,after multiple packs tossed in the towel on this onewe gave this a go and returned itall photos failed to develop
2120,1,everythingdidnt think it was going to break this soon
4831,1,my sons camera stop working and i dont know why i changed the batteries and everything it stopped working about  ago i need a refund or replacement asap he barely touches this camerarefund or replacement
6307,1,i purchased this and just like a lot of other reviews claimed the camera just randomly stopped working it was supervised and taken care of there was no mistreatment or abuse to this camerai tried the instructions and what it said to do nothing worked and that was it my daughter was pretty crushed because she absolutely loved taking and printing her own pictures i felt bad giving no stars or anything because it did work and while it did work it was outstanding it was so much fun creative artsy it was awesome the girls loved it its such a shame it just stops working after a monthpretty disappointed  year old
1688,1,dont buy this waste of moneycamera quality
13788,4,i like it a lot but it does spit steam out of the top of it and kind of makes a mess on the counter sometimes if i use a little too much water so kind of my fault probably but it makes some decent rice love it
3905,2,i did not receive the case with this orderno case
5757,1,i should have sent this back as soon as i tried it out and realized what a terrible product it is but i was in a bind and needed to make do every time i try to use it it shuts down before i can send a picture to print or worse while i am printing which wastes one of the very expensive photo sheets the app crashes any time i try to use the collage function and the printing quality is poor tho hi about what i expected when i ordered this product i would strongly caution against buying this printer as it is frustrating and rarely works as advertised as i tried it out and realized what a terrible product it is
289,1,missing part or what no flash light  and memory cardany one see this review not buy its  they are cheatedthe camera is old  out of model  being used returnedno flash light no memory come it with
17116,5,this smaller version of instant pot is so much easier for me to use in my small kitchen i wish they had included a cook book with it i was very pleased that the main cook pot is cast iron you can open the lid at any time to add other ingredients i was overwhelmed with my large pressure cooker instant pot and had a difficult time with the working the different features i could not believe how fast the instant pot was delivered the seller was  star  very pleased with this purchasei love this smaller version of instant pot
1566,2,i loved this camera until  months in it stopped charging and wont respond to any cords i cant charge it to get the photos off anymore or even turn it on and now its too late to request a new one as theres no option to call it faultystopped charging
9,5,it works well for my iphone  it charges fast the trick is to place it on the charger correctly i think the ones complaining about it not working are not placing it on the charger properly i love the black color and the light is unobtrusive but i can still tell when it is charging these are wonderfulnice charger
4853,1,there was no film it was supposed to have  boxes of filmmissing  boxes of film
780,1,i use a camera to take hundreds of photos for auctions and it appears i can only delete one photo at a time and that creates a huge problem for mei have only used this camera once so it is impossible to give a further review at this time it took forever to charge the battery if it is always like that it will be another huge problem after two weeks this garbage camera quit workingpicture quality seems to be goodit appears i can delete only one photo at a time after two weeks camera quit working
1596,1,i used this to take simple photos it worked for  months the flash is a joke to start my iphone light works better than this flash i use the camera a couple times out of the week for work the photos dont need to be super high quality so i thought a simple camera would do the job the flash is worthless and the camera gets stuck on the photo when its taken i have to take the battery out to reset the camera but it keeps malfunctioning over and overcheap camera  already broke
5653,1,this is my review update after using this camera for only  months of non continuous use i found out theres several issues with this camera that makes me want my money  battery dont even last  mins before getting a low battery red  the camera loses your recorded files just out the  the camera has a very bad frame drop issue that makes your recordings look like a stop motion  the camera does not actually shoot in  although it shows    fps it barely looks like  overall this is a definite do not buy you have been warned i wish i could have given it  starsgreat  beginners update after  months
11055,5,i bought this originally just for my rice and spam but after seeing the number of things i can use it for and cook in it has literally changed my mind and my life ive used it to make burgers and macaroni and everything in between it is one of the most versatile things i have ever usedcant live without it
2970,2,one pack was ok a bit too yellow to be honest the second pack came out with creamy stuff and damaged film wtf expensive film should not do thisbetter off buying at the store not here
1722,1,i was trying to figure out if i was recording or not there was no way to do it i read the instructions and it was not helpfuldo not buy this 
1924,1,this stopped working right away within  days camera quality was good but wow i shouldve believed the reviews when people said it stops workingstopped working within  days
7596,1,the lights and tripods appear to have been repackaged from amazon since where were received plastic bag in an amazon box they were rattling around in the box with the lights and wires all loose no instructions were included pretty lame and was something else missing after untangling the wires assembly was pretty straightforward i did figure out how to use the switches everything seemed to work fine and should provide the lighting i need for my photography its an inexpensive low budget system that fits my applicationlighting system arrived loose
933,1,not good qualitycheap
12114,5,"i used this for about one year i think this is the best rice cooker i have ever usedthe rice is not too soft or too hard it just rightthe best rice cooker"
7820,1,this is something you would put baseball cards in i guess its cheap and made of plastic dont waste your money i wish i hadnt 
1482,1,this is bull never came with sd card that it needs to even take a picturedissatisfied
17295,5,im used to this little rice cookers so this was intimidating there were no instructions for sticky rice and i asked no one answered that my question so i just dove in  cups water  cups cal rose rice and it came out perfect so im keeping itimpressed
3518,1,wouldnt turn ondefective
5414,1,this camera is very small photos are of a very low quality and you cannot adjust the settings to make it better it was a disappointment especially as i gifted it to a teenager not even suitable for a beginnernot ideal
11456,5,it is cute accessory to the kitchen easy to use and clean up two thumbs upyummy rice
9480,5,this rice maker was perfect even when we made jacoba rice the rice is grainy but it cooked just fine in my new rice cooker lovely nice addition to our familyrice  rice perfect rice
4192,1,purchased as a gift for my goddaughter and we were not able to take one picture for the camera did not work there was a light that constantly blinked and we could here the camera wanting to work but thats just it it was all sounds but no action had to send it back and i can only hope the replacement worksgift fail
8462,1,prosfun in a frustrating way funstratingcutenice as a toy not as a cameraconshard to uselittle control over shotslooks cheaptiny tiny picturesbreaks quickly for no reasoni really really wanted to love this camera i wanted one for a long time before i bought it i was excited when it got here i loaded up the film and started taking shots to get used to the modes first of all the pictures were smaller than i expected them to be and i was well aware that they would be small its very cheap looking maybe the brown model is nicer but the black one is very plasticy and looks like a cheap toy the modes on the camera are also pretty difficult to use and i absolutely hate the auto focus and lighting detector the default mode that supposedly detects the best lighting and focus for you is terrible and creates washed out photos especially outdoors and grey blobs with no color indoors the auto focus is so terrible that my subjects almost always come out fuzzy no matter what i do my shots almost never come out well ive done so many test shots to try and figure out how the modes and lighting affect shots that i wasted about half of my  sheets of film just trying to figure out how the camera works even after all that the different shooting and lighting modes never have the expected effect on my shots out of the around  pictures i took about  total came out looking good the rest thrown straight into my fail pile and marked with the lighting and shooting mode in a failed attempt to get a hang on this camera taking selfies with it is out of the question i even bought one of those snap on mirrors for it and could never get my face all the way in frame so i just stopped trying to take themi finally started getting used to this camera when it broke i had it for less than three months i got the e error that i now know is very common for anyone else who has this problem i hope you have the warranty card because if you dont youre screwed have fun with your  paperweight it took hours of googling and navigating fujifilms extremely complicated website to even figure out what was wrong my camera apparently just spontaneously broke i had used it just a few days ago went to take a picture of something and got that e when i turned it on none of the suggested fixes worked and finding the repair information was a daunting task i cant find the warranty card and i dont want to spend much more money on this hunk of crap but i will update on my experience with fujifilms support and repair costsso bottom line i do not recommend this camera if i ever buy another instant camera and i may not this experience has discouraged me im going with a polaroid if you are in any way artistic and care about the quality of your pictures this isnt for you if you want a fun and amusing toy to forget about in a few months then this is finea disappointing camera that broke quickly
1491,1,piece of crap not any better than a plastic kids toyone star
10254,4,this is a great beginner cooker it does everything advertised very wellgreat beginner cooker
4583,1,first of all i received a complete package with all the items just in time which was perfect my niece was extremely happy with it until the camera stopped working so everything was a messed up she was so sad cuz she was waiting for this present for so long and she got mad my present wascompletely ruin by this and this is not acceptableit was a good shop till stop working
17268,5,"i have been using my standard size instant pot almost daily even for small meals but the zest is small enough to use for my morning oatmeal and interestingly my oatmeal is fluffy and moist it was find in the instant pot but this is an impressive improvementt has a fliptop attached lid which has a handle making it easy to move around an dit takes up a lot less counter space the pot insert is very easy to cleanso far i like everything about itlove it"
16738,4,the design is pretty and the food is well made price is so so 
8400,2,this camera is the perfect size and the quality of the picturesprinting are just fine for the cameras intended use however within two days of use and only two packages of film the camera jammed during printing and we have been unable to remove the jammed print paper two very small screws inside the film compartment appear to be the way inside the camera but it does not come apart without prying and risking further damage to the camera the camera is not usable and will need to be returned or taken in for repair disappointing purchasethe picture and print quality are just fine for the price of this camera however
7992,1,absolutely terrible the picture quality is horrendous i am really disappointed in this camera i should have bought the normal instax mini as the quality is much better 
10,4,just make sure you know what side is up lolproduct delivers
6455,2,um maybe we got a bad batch but the one we had took photos that were under  w even tried a replacement if you know anything about digital media or cameras that says it all we tried different sd cards different lighting daylight versus indoor fortunately amazon was very helpful in processing the return sspend a little more and get a real camera or buy a waterproof case for your cell phone
7479,1,absolutely hate this camera and upset at all the missed footage i bought for recording my adventures hiking and kayaking its waterproof and has a remote you can attach to your wrist the remote is unreliable i have the camera mounted to a headband i use the remote to start and stop the recording no audible or visual queue the camera is even recording when the button is pressed other than a quick red light when starting and stopping the button should flash or stay solid when the record button is pressed then stop when you press the stop record button now what take the camera off to look at the display screen hit record make sure its recording put it back on take off again press stop record make sure it stopped put it back on completely defeats the purpose of a remote when youre doing more extreme activities i dont want an endless record only to have to go back and edit down to smaller files i want to start and stop recording at will missed  hours of footage i will never get backunreliable pos garbage crap yeah im angry
7055,1,i had this product for a while i was going to give it as a gift but decided to get something else so i kept it for myself i took it out of the box so excited to use it i got  pictures maybe then it stopped working never to be turned on again i tried charging it i tried everything and nothing works waste of money wouldve been a great product if it workeddo not waste your money
8565,2,i was excited to get this webcam but after my first use the picture quality is ok but the light even on the brightest setting is useless in a semibright room if you want it just for the picture then it is a good purchase for the price but if you have a need for a light this is not the way to gosmall decent picture low light power
5576,1,very disappointed with the quality of the picturequality
3788,1,i bought this as a gift for my young grandson the camera came in a sealed box with preloaded very inappropriate pics of nearly nude women not sure how this happens with a new camera luckily his mom found them first and was able to delete them hence this review bewaredefinitely not recommending for kidsbeware inappropriate images
8062,1,ive been using polaroid cameras for years this is a terrible camera the one i received does not work it wont even acknowledge the film cassette when its loaded it did one time only there is a glitch somewhere and it does not properly function not a good first impression it is just a frustrating plastic mess that has taken the joy out of using polaroid cameras now im caught up trying to get a refund or a replacement i regret buying this camera i will go back to my decades old cameras the app is annoying but im not a fan of such things so i shouldnt have even bought a model like this its gimmicky junkwaste of money
640,2,i had high expectations for this camera after some reviews but when i started using the camera it was different i dont know what it was but the lighting was off i think when it tried to detect me it went into some black and white modeit will take pics and videos with that effect if its at night it wont take the pictures until it find some sort of light to detect anything its very odd and frustrating when i want to take a picture even if the flash is on too i guess i got to turn in my phone flash first then the camera can function and then flash with its built in one crazy the pictures and videos just looked worse than a  disposable camera from the thrift store i really liked the idea of having a camera but it gives me so much trouble im just going to send it back going to point out that it has a bold white font with blue background when you turn it off and on with a welcomegoodbye which makes it look like a  self built monitor idklighting and visibility
385,1,if youre thinking about buying this camera for vloggingdont waste your money this camera has no imagevideo stabilization i tried mounting in my car on the windshield and the vibrations from the car makes the camera shake the video quality is trasshhhhh especially in lower lighting situation and even in well lit areas the sound quality also isnt the best but you get what you pay for invest in something betteronly pro about this camera is how lightweight and convenient it ishorrible vlogging camera
173,2,the canon eos rebel  was described as a good camera for beginners  not true only in auto focus is it a point and shoot camera and then it takes the auto focus  seconds to focus and shoot  by then my subject had moved on this camera definitely requires an extensive education in photography or much experience with this type of camera in order to operate in its many modes and settings probably a great camera for someone with the education or experience  but definitely not for beginners need to change this language in item description returned item satisfactorilynot a good camera for beginners  auto focus mode for beginners is much to slow
9505,5,so very simple to use and clean love itrice cooker
2813,2,didnt even use it seemed cheaply made very small was looking for small but not this small after reading more reviews i decided to just return it might be good for younger children  and underreturned
7789,1,bought as a christmas gift for my son came with a bad sd card so he cant even use it till i go buy another onebad sd
9097,1,play video bruuhh dont buy this  it has defects  shot there is lines and the last  shot has no lines but bruuuh i wasnt against the light and i cant even see my dog in the picture lol too bad i didnt read the reviews save your money this aint worth itdont buy this its a fluke
16745,5,i am really happy to usei like it
1905,1,was so excited to use this for my wedding photo book but it broke after about  pictures were takenwe dont have a photo guest book now and because we purchased in advance of the wedding  couldnt return as it was outside of the return windowbroke right away
9497,5,i love this thing definitely good for a one person householdgreat for one person
4098,1,i was tempted by the recognition that arlo received but the product is not good i deeply regret to have bought this product is a nice toy but is not a security product it is really unreliable and slowthe pros as advertised it is really easy to set them up this is the only advantage that this cameras havethe cons really slow either you are accessing the arlo website or using the phone app is really slow and it seems too error prone i dont know if the servers they use are crappy but it is certainly not my internet connection  if you click start  or  cameras at the same time they all fail except for one you need to go  by  to turn them on and most of the time you will need to retry more than  time on each camera battery consumption is high poor power management they want to manage this by recording  seconds of video only upon motion detect you can record at most  minutes batteries are expensive  or  and guess what they dont recommend using rechargeable batteries  video quality bad it is hd yes but the quality is not good the lenses are too small hence the image resolution you get is bad i bought a  cameras bundle  of them is broken you see a magenta colored tone from forums it seems to be a normal issue support kindly offered to replace it but im not currently in the us so yeah something that is not clearly stated anywhere there are some countries in which they dont offer any plan so your upper limit will be five cameras the sensitivity configuration for each camera is really bad ive tried all  positions and i endup always in cameras always turn or by my dog or cameras are never triggered even if i move  ahead of them  so if you are leaving on vacations ask someone to replace the batteries im getting  notifications in one camera and the batteries last  day only rechargeable batteriesagain i deeply regret buying this dont be fool by the promises of this product just buy a proven security camera that can be easily expanded save the recording in dropbox and thats it you will get a reliably and fast system with recordings stored in the cloud without needing to subscribe to weird plansbut the product is not good i deeply regret to have bought this product
1972,1,very cheap materialnot it
3349,2,should have spent more for a camera for my  year oldcheap blurry
5636,1,sent me a broken cameranow im having trouble sending it backdefective
5634,1,i bought it for my grandson and he thought it was difficult to operate he is  years old and took a photography class in collegedifficult to use
1890,1,i bought this to replace my instax mini  which randomly stopped working unfortunately this instax mini  constantly has to be reset by taking the batteries out and putting them back in and even that doesnt guarantee it works pretty disappointed so will be returningconstantly has to be reset
7846,2,i always had connection problems from the date i start using it i had to restart reset disconnect as of today it completely stopped working i wouldnt recommend buying this product it is a painstopped working right after one year print quality was below mediocre
14165,1,the lcd screen display of what you are selecting is too tiny and very faint and also the gold select functions below are all poorly colored they are gold with clear font you cannot see them either its a very poor design otherwise it would be an excellent rice cooker if you have eyes like a hawk or eagle this is for you but if you dont like putting on glasses bending your head over sideways trying to read the functions and reading microscopic print please pass on this rice cookeryou cannot read any of the menu items or buttons for selecting anything dont buy
14775,5,this rice cooker makes excellent quality rice for the price i had used cheap rice cookers and an instapot to make rice previously the texture of the rice this rice cooker makes is fantastic meals are so much better with the rice cooked in this appliance i was going to spend much more on a rice cooker im very happy i purchased this oneoutstanding rice for the price
10325,5,its extremely easy to use gives me perfectly fluffy rice each time will highly recommendease of use
6604,2,strike  camera froze on me multiple times had to remove and reinstall the aa batteries it takesstrike  internal clock stops when camera is turned off smart device connection isnt automatic so my photos with date stamp ended up having wrong datestrike  isnt a strike three i was already returning the camera for refundthe positives dont out weigh the current negativesfeatures dont make up for poor interface
5734,1,bought as a refill pack for polaroid  they dont work for this cameradont work for polaroid 
1224,2,the picture quality is not that great it os light weight with the picture not so good thought should have been cheaperits okay not worth the price for child camera
8413,1,received photo paper and nothing else no camera case stickers or albumwould of been nice
3938,1,i bought this fir my  year old fir her birthday she has wanted one for awhile i bought it in bundle and all pictures come out black i ordered another batch of film thinking the film maybe had expired being in a bundle nope new film is all black too contacted seller telling them because i could not send back to replace as the  days expired while i was ordering other film and trying to solve my own problem very disappointed the seller could have just replaced the camera after all thispictures keep coming out black
10063,5,"i bought this in jan  its may  its almost a decade old and its still goinghonestly i only use it for white rice cooks sushi rice perfectly cooks jasmine rice perfectly done in  minutes ive timed it  fastest rice cooker easy to clean couldnt be any simpler to use cheap it was  then and its  now has been with me for a decade the only negative is that i used metal forks and spoons in it when i was young and foolish so some rice can stick especially if its left on keep warm for a long time washed rice sticks less oiled rice for individual grains like fried rice doesnt stick at alli have tried to zojirushi rice cookers on sushi white rice long grain white modes it takes  minutes everytime and we always google why is my rice overcookedi have never had to troubleshoot my aroma rice cooker it just works im so annoyed by higher quality brands that make you experiment to try to get their product to workif i want fluffy individual grains to go with beans or to go into fried rice i thoroughly wash the jasmine rice then mix in a little oil to the pot before i turn it onif i want sushi rice i just wash it a normal amount  and fill up to the line just in case anyone is unfamiliar you wash the extra starch off of rice before you cook it usually you just put the rice in the cooking bowl fill it part way with water swirl the grains around tip out as much of the water as you can without spilling grains  and repeat until the water is nearly clear if you want less sticky rice like for fried rice wash it for longer to get all extra starch offthen you add fresh water i use filtered to the washed rice until it hits the fill line for however many cups of rice you put in just use the cup that comes with the rice cooker and fill to the line i dont know why the finger method doesnt give you the same ratio and result but i just trust the machine its still flawless a decade later cooks various types of rice perfectly every time effortless cooks twice as fast as othersi would buy it in a heartbeat for anyone else i wouldnt waste my time or money on anything elsealways perfect   as fast   years and still going strong"
574,1,horrible item was sent back within  waste of money  
14998,5,used many times still like new 
7684,1,i had to update my review the camera stopped working after one day the image started coming out blurry and very bad quality dont waste your moneymy daughter loves it until
887,2,i returned iti was looking for a camera to use for making indooroutdoor videos unfortunately the camera is not really suitable for either as the video quality is very subpar for outside videos it is ok but the video quality still get pixelated at  with sufficient lighting for inside videos this device was completely unusable i tried with direct and indirect light and no matter how much light i used the image quality was always bad und coarsei tried several different memory cards as well to see if that makes a difference but to no availalso what was really annoying was the beep sound when buttons where pushed or one flipped through the menu took me a while but that was the first thing that was turned offit does take decent still images thoughit is well not great
2395,1,play video not working most of the time dont even take a picture and when it does the pictures come out white very disappointed especially that the photo almost cost more than a dollar each 
11925,5,this rice cooker only recently started being marketed to americans a few years back and thank god for that this is a rice cooker that would proudly be in any japanese home and using it once will show you why you add the rice rinse it will as water to the fill line turn it on and let it rock never any burnt rice in the bottom never soggy and hold the rice warm and fresh for hours a must have if you eat rice at least once a weekbest rice cooker
726,1,they do not hold a charge only  pictures can be taken before battery is deafthese cameras are extremely poor
1915,1,i bought this because i make jewelry and i write what each requires i thought taking a polaroid and taping it to the back of the card would be great i went through a whole package of film and none were centered leaving me with half a pic it didnt matter how i moved the camera all photos were out of focus i regret purchasing this itemall photos off center
17341,5,"my mother told me we didnt need a rice cooker the  oyster one we had was fine wrongi was tired of soggyinconsistent rice some days its tolerable other days i have to tinker with it for hours because its too dry then its too wet i did research to make sure it was worth my money looked up japanesekoreanthai chefs recommendations amazon recommendations reddit as well finally i just decided to get the most reasonably expensive but also worthmymoney rice cooker i could find and stumbled upon this brand i decided i was tired of garbage rice and just found one of the most expensive read and compared the reviews with the other expensive ricecookers and settled on this onebest purchase ever i mainly use it for shortgrain sushi rice but i would feel much better about cooking and eating brown or jasmine rice in this than anything else ive ever made i get consistent rice every time its perfectly sticky as long as you wash the starch off of your rice wellive made fried rice with it i dont even have to wait until the next day to cook the rice just let it cool a little and its good to fryive been recommending it to everyone i know ive never been able to explain what perfect rice tastes like until i bought thisthe controls are simple most of the rice takes  minutes to cook but it is very worth it doesnt matter how much or how little you put it always comes out the same and tastes great it also does a little jingle twinkle twinkle little star when its done cooking get this rice cooker if you were thinking i need a rice cooker get this rice cooker if you just burned your rice or pulled it out of your old rice cooker and its still sticking to the pan get this rice cooker if you just like cooking get this rice cooker it also doubles as a steamer if you have a strainer and works wonderfullyto summarize get this rice cooker ive owned it about  months and have had no programs with it it works as a great warmer i left rice in it overnight and it was still moist just not as moist as it being fresh threw a spoonful or two of water inside and let it sit for a little and it perked right back up  if it broke i would buy it againif you love yourself and want to feel like royalty get this rice cooker im begging"
3666,1,bought  of these for our wedding and both of them take horrible dark pictures you cant even recognize the people in the pictures i dont see how this camera gets such high reviews the polaroids from the  take better pictures spend your money elsewherehorrible dark oictures
7706,1,i bought this camera to use in my classroom because cell phones arent allowed the picture quality was okay but not as good as i was expecting the problem was that when i went to upload the pictures for printing they wouldnt load on any of the  computers that i have at home or my computer at work i got an incompatible device message since i cant print the pictures the camera is pretty much uselessit wont load pictures onto computer for printing
15029,5,"works great ive had it for  years and it still works perfectlyeasy to useeasy to cleanwhat more could you wantlove it"
3580,1,i havent used this more than a couple times and it no longer turns on waste of money pile of garbagedoesnt turn on

5603,1,i waited sometime before i reviewed so i could really get a feel for it and its just a waste of money in my opinion the quality isnt great when you replay videos its slow and distorted i feel it could work for pictures but you would be better off using your phone anyways i ended up just letting my son have it i originally got it because it kept popping up as recommended i feel those who may give positive reviews arent the ones who are being paid to promote it i would recommend saving your money to get a better camerajust no
5276,1,i bought this camera because the ad stated that i can take continuous pictures my goal is to take pictures of my son while he assembles his legos i want a camera that can take a picture every  or  secondsi am trying to work on this camera but i cannot obtain what i want there is no more information on the manual about this feature that is the reason why i feel frustratedi bought this camera because the ad stated that i

6057,1,weve had the camera a little over a month and the apps wont open and we cant take picturesnot worth the money
1089,1,i purchased this on a whim i decided to try this out because it was on sale and im looking for a camera to do video this camera does not do over  photos or video just to get that out there no matter what setting it is on it only produces  or lower resolutionthis didnt come as much of a shock to me since it feels like a disposable camera so i decided to still put it through some tests to see if it would suit my needs  once i hooked it up to the computer to test out the pc connected feature things kept getting worse i did a quick  minute test and the camera stopped working less than a minute in i removed the camera and decided to try and turn it back on but it wouldnt come back on i gave it  minutes and the camera did turn back on so likely it overheated after a minuteif you want a cheap camera that takes horrible pictures this is the camera for you if you are looking for the camera mentioned in all the good reviews then i suggest saving your money everyone stating that this camera is exceptional even though it feels cheap must not be living in the same era or were paid off in some way by the manufactureronly slightly better than a disposable camera
3120,1,the film works its just old the instructions say use within a year from production date my production date is  well today is  still seems to work ill probably buy from polaroids website next timegreat film just old
14234,5,it meets all my needs of cooking rice porridge and delay start it even comes with an option of cooking for cake its perfect for my small family of  people it has a handler for easy carrying and it has scales inside on the wall of the container to indicate the water level for rice and porridge for different cups cleaning is also quite easy it doesnt come with the steaming rack it works so far so good and we dont have complaintversatile perfect for small family easy operate
3515,1,it doesnt do the job very blury picsdont buy
8574,1,the picture quality on this is great but it wont allow you to zoom in so keep that in mind if you want to hide your body in video conference calls the light on the front of this broke to the point that its unusable note that im super careful with my electronics so just basic use is all it took the mess it up it does this strobe effect any time i put the front light on and the only way to turn it off is to unplug it and plug it back in holding down the top middle of the light which is how you are supposed to be able to change the modes of light brightness fail every time i turn it on making the light completely useless now the picture is pretty good for the money but you get what you pay for as far as functionalitylongevity i wouldnt recommend this productafter  months its lost some functionality

3352,1,upon opening the box it seemed very cheap i wanted it to be ready to use for a christmas present so i started charging it after  hours of charging it would not even turn on had to return it disappointing christmas morningnever worked
8531,1,just like many others i bought this camera and was super excited to try it out but when i tried to load the film it didnt work and all i got was an e i bought it for a trip so i didnt have time to deal with returning it when i came back and tried again to load the film and it still didnt work i had missed the amazon return window now i need to send it back to fujifilm to have it repaired i havent even used this yet and it has cost me two destroyed packs of film and shipping to fujifilm repairs i doubt all this struggle and wasted money will be worth it in the end check it immediately when you get it and return it asap if defectivefilm wont load  send it back immediately if defective
6771,1,two additional lens do not attach to the camera they are useless as part of this kit bag is cheap vinyl and tripod is cheap plastic i can understand the cheap accessories but cannot forgive the useless lenscheap accessories and lens not compatible
9094,1,polaroid expired film is not as forgiving and instax pictured expiration is  and im shooting in  this should be heavily discounted but it is notyear old film will not work
277,1,ive had to return this camera twice to the panasonic repair center in mcallen texas in fact i just sent it back for the second time three days ago the focus just doesnt work and ive shared it with two emmy winning videographers who both said the same thing it struggles to focus either in manual or automatic settings unless one is zoomed way in so in other words its impossible to shoot wide shots i really want to like this camera but if it comes back from the repair center with the problem not fixed im going on the warpath this camera has already burned me on several important shoots for our outdoor idaho series this summer bruce reichertcamera focus doesnt work
461,1,this product is old poor and broken it also smell worse its not in very good condition its in very bad conditionpoor product
29,4,i like the auto shutoff when my phone reaches  however charger would be better if the led wasnt always on led is on if a no phone on charger b problem charging the phone or c phone is on charger but fully charged why not just have the led off if no phone being charged at night i dont like seeing the led when im in bedgood but could be better
6774,1,comes with only  papers for pictures supposed to be  however great price for all you get i bought my daughter a sprocket a couple of years ago and it was twice the price no paper and it was printer only no camera so great valueupdatepos prints two pictures then freezes and no way to turn off or reset i still have  of the original films so disappointing i do not recommend this product waste of moneypoor value
14110,5,the products of this brand are really good the juicer and egg steamer of this brand were very easy to use before when i saw this rice cooker i bought it immediately after receiving the goods i was very surprised the workmanship design was very good and there were many functions i can cook a lot of delicious food in the future i am happy to think about it and it is worth recommendinggood brand goods
11248,5,be aware that the pot that goes inside the cooker is not made of solid ceramic rather it is a metal pot that has a ceramic coating instead of a more traditional teflon coating so for anyone looking to get away from teflon this is a great alternative the cooker is relatively small compared to most so its great for  or  people who want to make fresh batches of food if you looking to make larger batches for either more people or to have lots of left overs this might be too small for yougreat little rice cooker with ceramic coated insert
3737,1,the camera made cheap had trouble putting the battery in once i got it in it would not come out the zoom did not work and the battery would not charge i end up returning this itemdont waste your money
8754,1,we bought this to use at our wedding so people could upload a picture of themselves with the guestbook every picture was dark and out of focus that you could not recognize the person even when we take pictures in our apartment under a more controlled setting they come out dark and blurry half of the time between the camera and film we spent like  and got maybe  pictures worth keeping dont bother with itreal review
17673,5,i love this rice cooker the rice comes out fluffy and perfect every time even my husband noticed how each rice grain is independent of the others its hard to describe they dont clump together or get mushy i can leave it on the warm setting and it stays perfect and hot without getting a crust on the bottom like my old cooker used to do i was surprised how heavy the cooking pot is its a very heavy duty thick nonstick coated pot the only negative is that is does get a slight ring of stuck on film just around the waterline i soak the pot in warm soapy water but i also have to scrub it a bit with a soft sponge not a real issue compared to the quality of the rice it producesthe rice from this is fantastic
8269,1,the product is great but when they send it there was a missing parts originally send to me i returned it back but they never paid me back they accused me that i was stalling that missing partsit was very unpleasant to deal with thismissing parts send to me

11239,4,i like this little rice cooker its just the right size for a single person or couple its cute and doesnt take up much room i made jasmine rice and it came out great i like my rice a little drier than my husband does so when i make it for him i just put a little more water in i bought it specifically for rice so havent tried the oats or quinoa yetnice little rice cooker

5514,2,really disappointed in this camera bought as an inexpensive backup while my  is in service and got what i paid fora diopter that constantly changes on its own a frustrating af lag tracking that doesnt track no manual focus a video record button that may or may not record lots of noise in low lightthe list goes on im sure this is fine for casual photogs the zoom burst and grip are ok but serious wildlife photogs looking for an inexpensive backup should spend your  elsewhere not worth  i could return

5254,2,the auto focus on this camera is horrible ive had it for several months have tried all kinds of different settings with the auto focus and ive only been able to get a crisp focus on afew pictures i owed a nikon  for  years prior to this and never had a problem with the auto focus the functions buttons settings on this camera are all very similar to the way they were on my  so i thought i would be able to just start using this camera without any problems i really hate this camera and wish i had bought a cannoni wish i had bought a different camera

13643,5,"i researched several rice cookers on this site and i read every single review for this zojurishi before making my decision to order it i was aware of the warnings about the sputtering but i decided to take a chance on it anyway im very glad i did ive been using it for months now and im incredibly happy with it it cooks rice wonderfully and its the perfect size for a small family theres three of us taking the recommendations of previous reviewers i follow the directions on the package of rice as opposed to the cookers instructions and its worked quite well ive used it for jasmine rice and sushi rice and both have come out great had a little trouble with brown rice i have had the sputtering happen once but it was because the cooker was too full and now that im aware of that i havent had the problem since i definitely recommend the zojirushi rice cooker to anyone that needs a small easytouse reliable rice cooker that can stand up well to frequent usejuly    nearly three years after my initial purchase september  of this rice cooker i just had to come on here and add that im still using it regularly several times a week most weeks its in great shape and still cooks rice wonderfully this has been one of the best appliance investments ive ever made  it was more than worth every penny i might eventually upgrade to one of the fuzzy logic models but this serves my needs perfectly for nowjanuary    over  years and were still using it and its still in great shape its just recently in the last year or so started to toast not really burn the rice a bit on the bottom of the pan but that can be attributed to the nonstick coating on the bottom being a bit scratched up after  years of use i might replace the pan but i have no reason to replace the cooker itself we even got a fuzzy logic model about a year ago and while we do use that one regularly this one still gets used frequently as well when we dont plan ahead and need the rice done more quickly the cook time in this one is  minutes the fuzzy logic one takes  minutes there is not any noticeable at least to me difference in the quality of the cooked rice other than the toasting issue already mentioned which doesnt happen in then much newer one understandably while i love the options my fuzzy logic cooker offers for basic rice this little workhorse is still great and will be in my kitchen until it dies at which point i will probably buy another oneglad i took the risk  still going strong"
8001,2,i was very optimist about the product but after buying it i am very disappointed the printed photos are very shabby and poor quality 
3850,1,i bought this camera for a trip overseas but couldnt really see the pictures until i got home as i had no way to download them onto a bigger screen i was very disappointed in the picture quality also the batteries have to be charged in the camera which turns the camera on while they are charging i could not figure out the zoom feature so never used it unfortunately it is too late to send it back so i am stuck with it not quite the great camera that everyone has talked about
2344,1,bought this for my daughter took pictures and they come out very burlypoor quality
5240,2,i am not a camera expert and i know this is not a professional camera but i bought a nikon expecting ease of use to take well focused decent quality images bottom line with  megapixels i expect better quality than my smart phone but i am not getting it every picture is fuzzier than i expect i even rented another one to see if mine was faulty but the result was the samedisappointed not better than my phone
4183,1, overall this is a great product my other daughter has one i ordered this for my youngest daughters birthday and was excited that it came with  sheets of film little kids take lots of useless pictures but when i unboxed it theres only  sheets of film i tried to reach out to amazon and the manufacture and i havent gotten anywhere so maybe a one star review will get their attention just be aware you might not get all  sheets of filmmissing  sheets of film

13950,5,"cooking rice is so easy using this item shouldve bought a good quality rice cooker along time ago worth every penny some of the programming is set at preprogram so you just have to put the ricewater and then push one button to get it started i make a lot of fried rice  the quick rice cook setting is perfect for fried rice the rice is a little on the dry side on that setting the white rice setting cooks the rice perfectone of the biggest things i like about this rice cooker is that it has a handle i dont like keeping my appliances on the counter so the handle makes it easy to pick up and stowaway in the cabinet i believe the handle is so that in some countries they carry the rice cooker to the eating area so the rice is always hotthe plug is heavy duty the cooking pot is heavy and precision made almost as heavy as some of my small castiron pans everything about the rice cooker screams qualityno matter how lazy you are dont put the pot in the dishwasher let it cool off and just a few wipes under water cleans it up it would be a great mistake putting it in a dishwashertoshiba digital rice cooker"
3369,1,horrible quality wouldnt recommendhorrible picture quality
11194,4,"i probably will be able to come back and give this little gem an extra star after i have learned its ways this is my first ever experience with a rice cooker and with my brothers help on the phone guiding me all the way i chose this one as being about the right size for our needs and close enough to his  year old national panasonic in looks features and response of reviewersit is a darling size it fits nicely in the cupboard with the rest of the pots and pans which is a plus as we have way too many electrical appliances on the counters i suspect though that i may find it is a little small for our needs but for the oddest of reasons it actually makes plenty of rice for our needs and in the end it came out beautifully but what a mess getting there it boiled over and some of its watermoisture ended up on the counter and on the lid some splashed all over other appliances on the counter since i got this in the hopes that it would be not only less mess but a setitandleaveit arrangement this was distressing to me after its little tantrum it was harder to clean up than having to stand over my gas stove to keep my rice from boiling over lolthis little rice cooker is a  cup uncooked  cup cooked unit and i started only with  cups of uncooked rice by my calculations i should have had no problems  however  lets rephrase this a little because to my astonishment people dont seem to even notice let alone feel entirely misslead that  cup to the rice cooker does not equal  cup   cup   cup  yes that is right the little measuring device which comes with it is not a whole cup but  of a cup still i used their little cup and placed its contents in a larger glass measuring cup so that i could rinse off the rice and thus i know that i started with  cups of rinsed rice  well below the max  cups that the cooker will accommodateok now that we have the measurements understood here it is rephrasedthe maximum amount of uncooked rice the the rice cooker holds is   cups  cups the amount of uncooked rinsed basmati rice i placed in the cooker    cups  cups the amount of water i added to the uncooked rice in the rice cooker    cups  cupsthis is less than  x the water and slightly more than  xthere should have been plenty of room for the expansion of the rice which there was but the boiling process made the water escape the pot which would indicate that there was too much water for the size of the pot since there was fully  of a cup less uncooked rice than the rice cooker could potentially handle i dread to think what my kitchen would have looked like had i decided to cook a greater amount of rice lolon the other hand even though about  cup of water escaped the rice seemed not to suffer for it so next time i will try a little less rice and a ratio of water that is closer to the  x rule of thumb that i have always used until these newer pots with the thick bottoms required more water so as not to burn the rice  hence my statement above that i might be able to come back and adjust the number of stars the rice was awesome was not sticky nice an fluffy the pot cleaned up well except the lid was a little difficult but i waited too long before trying i should have soaked it right awayi would recommend this little unit but only if you are a one cup of rice at a time cooker  for two people maybe if i figure out what the water ratio is for different rices i will come back and amend thisfits nicely in the cupboard with the rest of the pots "
601,1,pictures taken with zoom are awful they appear blurred and cameras have one job and that is to deliver good quality pictures had camera set to the highest quality resolution for the price was not expecting much and this camera managed to disappointdigital zoom is awful and blurry
6213,2,it is solid built however it is not for those who shoot without tripod there is no way you can use it with camera hanging from your neck and you must use a hood on the lense otherwise this cover will cover part of the frame i dont like it at all but didnt try it on time so now its past one month return period oh welldont get it unless you shoot with tripod all the time
3646,1,i bought this product for a beach trip so i could scrapbook i thought it would be perfect it was advertised well and looked like exactly what i needed until i took my first photo the photos were incredibly white washed and overexposed i did so much research on why this could be happening including how i was holding the camera and trying different film i was disappointed heavily by the results facial features were barely there it was blurry and over exposed out of  sheets of film i had  photos that were okay quality i wouldnt recommend this camera for what you pay its just not worth it also film is outrageouspoor quality and no settings
3556,2,this was my first time getting a gopro the red light didnt turn on as i plugged the cable in to charge closing the battery tab was extremely difficult it got even worse when it got stuck and wouldnt open or close all the way through i was terribly disappointed with these defectsbattery tab stuckbattery not charging
2722,1,i wasnt expecting anything amazing for  but this is a joke theres nothing to it light as a feather and i dont mean that as a compliment it feels like a cheap empty case we have only been able to take  pics all from the day my daughter opened it as a gift it hasnt worked since that first day it turns on but wont take a picture it constantly says theres no card even when there is one in it weve tried a couple different ones and the lens cap broke on day  its like something youd buy at the dollar store incredibly disappointingstopped working almost immediately
5461,2, photos do not transfer over via the panasonic app if theyre shot in  which makes it difficult to simply use probably better to get a camera with bluetooth settingok but not best functionally

7346,1,initially i was excited to receive this in the mail the reviews on it were mixed but i figured i would give it a try the reason for needing a projector in the first place is to be able to trace images that are approximately  onto  or  canvases the image would not project more than the size of a thumbnail sketch i tried maneuvering the neolucida as well as the canvas at various lengthspositions but no such luck i would have needed an extender arm  tallnot kidding i was very disappointed that this didnt work as i had hoped however the return process was excellent so i would give  stars for that i ended up purchasing a portable home theater projector for under a hundred  that works amazingly well for what i need it to dodisappointed
6395,2,you get what you pay for and for  i actually expected junk but im rating this as if the camera details were stated truthfully and for that they deserve  star since it does not do  which is ironically stamped on the front of the camera the video is really low quality it has several settings to adjust quality but no matter what setting you use it always comes out as  but even that seems high because the actual quality of the video is much worse than  on the plus side i will not mind using this underwater because if it dies it was crazy cheapthis is advertised as a  camera it is not

2033,1,i bought this camera in april  and not even  months later the camera wasnt taking the pictures right my polaroids now come out with more than half of the picture blacked out or when they do come out whole the picture is way too dark the dark filter over it happens no matter your lighting i was excited to have this camera but im sad it barely lasted me i maybe got less than  solid photos out of it i attached a photo that i took today in broad daylight to show at least the darkness defect hope this helpsnot worth the investment
5685,1,let me just start by saying i am not impressed for  i feel like this should print much better quality photos before purchasing this camera i compared and contrasted between it and the instax i liked the instax but wanted more options as far as picture color and i wanted as big of a picture as i could get while still remaining compact so i decided to splurge and go with the snap my first picture i took with the snap not happy with my purchase in the slightest its blurry unfocused grainy and white washed in some parts picture to follow i have a instax picture for comparison between the two cameras flaw  picture quality of the snap is crap compared to the instax flaw  i feel like i have to baby this polaroid camera because the design is so flawed you can very easily turn it on and snap bunch of pictures without knowing flaw  the lens cap although protective  does its job ive almost snapped five black pictures because you have to remember to remove it before taking an actual picture also you have to make sure you put it back on in the correct direction or else it will not sit properly picture to follow flaw  there is no way to know you took a picture until you release the shutter button because a confirmation noise is not made until the button is released flaw  the viewfinder is not accurate the picture is off from what i was physically looking at i centered my subject in the viewfinder and in the picture the subject is off centermy biggest regret is that i read the reviews for the snap before buying and i did not listen i should have i thought people were exaggerating but they arent this camera is not worth  impressed
17281,5,we love it this is so simple to use and makes wonderful sticky ricemakes great rice
431,2,the camera itself is great but im beginning to doubt they were stored in a great environment there are two particles in the viewfinder that kind of look like bugsthe camera still works and those things dont show in the pictures or on the screen only when viewing through the viewfinder i was unable to clean them through the exterior so it looks like they are inside the viewfinderi contacted customer service for canon and there was nothing they could do besides offer to service this is a terrible experience as i got the camera new and proceeded to travel to costa rica it will get the job done but just more annoyingly when viewing through the viewfinderid recommend to get this camera but either not through amazon or power it on and work it before deciding to keep itgreat beginner camera but came with some particles in the viewfinder
7736,1,horrible light weight flimsy horrible picture quality and not easy to use maybe if this more like  dollars and a stocking stuffer but even then i dont think itll help my kid to learn to take pics i tried going from the playback to taking another picture and even that wouldnt work right confusing for me and to think i wanted my  year old to figure out no waydont waste your money
13266,5,very easy to clean and usevery easy to use
2512,1,i have bought two of these cameras for two of my grands one eleven and one eight both cameras were great fun and entertaining but both were broken within a few months i understand that making a camera for a child can be problematic but if you cant make one that can stand up to being used by a child dont make one at all very disappointed and a big waste of moneyfun while it lasts but it does not last
3471,1,tldr this is a good looking product and does exactly what it says it will however photo quality is not at all what it should be and the mechanics are quite finicky if you must have an instantdevelop camera keep lookingi researched instantprint cameras and this was supposed to be a good choice if you want a photo larger than two postage stamps put together unfortunately more research after i got it home and tried it out and assumed i must be doing something wrong tells me that no its just not a good product for what its supposed to do take and print photosthe quality of the pictures is terrible blurry with washed out colors and color that is just plain incorrect a medium jewel purple came out almost pastel etc the lack of control over flash is a serious flaw as the cameras sensor seems to think it needs to go off any time youre indoors and not in the very brightest of lighting so on top of everything the photos often come out seriously overexposed i get the feeling youd get much better results taking pics from about six feet away as is the intended use but didnt waste more film trying that outyoure better off snapping pictures with your phone and taking a few extra seconds to just print them out in a small size very disappointed really wanted this to work so i could easily take pictures for journaling but the photo quality is a nonstarter especially for the pricein addition the button to take a photo is very sensitive so dont hold your finger anywhere near it until youre ready to take a picture the frame in the viewfinder is extreeeemely inaccurate for photos that are taken within a few feet of the subject i went through probably three to five shots before i figured out how to take them without getting several inches cut off of each side definitely get extra film out of the gate and i recommend a little case too otherwise its just sitting out waiting to get scratched or banged around the starer pack mine came with had five sheets not ten and i went through all of them just on the learning curvegood looks very disappointing substance
6840,1,it is waterproof and it works well the only thing is it doesnt have a larger memory check what your needs are and read the description very carefully before you buygreat price and it works well
12115,5,get a measurement cup measure  cup of rice or more put it in the little black pan get the white plastic thing outta there measure enough water so it fills up to the  in the pan if you added white rice make sure it fills up to the  labeled under  white rice connect the rice cooker make sure the little arrow is next to the type or rice you want to make press start listen to little cute jingle smile wait hear little jingle telling you rice is ready fluff up the rice  eat you can take out the little pan to wash it dry it super well and it is ready to make more riceif this is your first rice cooker
15586,5,"a rice cooker is one of those things that you simply cannot try to replace with other gadgets many hot pots and electric cookers have come out in the past few years that say they are good for cooking rice in my experience they make the rice too soft by cooking it too hot and at high pressures as much as you want to keep your kitchen clutter free if you are someone that eats rice a lot you will need to have a rice cooker and this one is a great examplethe benefit of a rice cooker is you can just pour rice and water maybe a pinch of sugar or salt and youre done with it this product provides that same efficiency and unlike other smaller rice cookers it does seem to keep the rice in good condition for a long period of time my other small rice cooker seems to start burning the bottom of the rice if you leave it in too long another benefit of having a rice cooker is having access to rice throughout the day i have been able to just leave this device running from lunch to dinner time and there is always food ready for the family members who are on the go not only is it convenient its actually going to prevent the food waste that inevitably comes with making too much at a time on the stove topoverall the product works well and i highly recommend it if you are someone that likes to have rice with most of your mealsexcellent rice cooker perfect temperature"
1896,1,it was working perfectly but then it started to fail and now its not working at all pure garbagedont buy it
1697,2,didnt seem to have good sound quality when recording videos the quality of picture is sometimes blurry due to the reflection of light of the lensesoverrated
3254,2,the recharger plug came doa other than that it is not bad for a beginners camera but not that great either the flash is just a lightok for beginners kids camera
4529,1,charged over night was still dead next day unplugged and reinserted cable tried removing and reinserting the battery just would not hold a charge tried charging over  times constant red light never turns green wont even turn on what the heck is that crap for  so disappointed had to return totally unreliable and unacceptable for a  productnever held a charge had to return it
10445,5,"sometimes you purchase something you think you need to find you do not need it at alli am positive it is easy to clean and use and the timer works can say it has caused no problems for mesits unused"
8592,1,it looks and works great until it will start flashing midway through a call and not respond to tapsit just starts flashing midcall
1066,1,didnt work unless plugged in and ate my battery and sd cardgood idea but bad execute
9269,5,i love this its so much faster to cook riceworks great
3553,1,screen started flickering after the first day they said it was a manufacturing defect first time gopro user and completely disappointed i am not going to bother with a replacement as this looks to be a major issue with the gopro  flicking after  day
4223,1,the instruction manual is unclear its written in literally translated chinese which is very difficult to read the manual also lacks clear instructions for a basic setup or even how to properly insert the memory card avoid this junk at all costsinstruction manual very poor
5191,2,not what i expected and the camera is very bad i dont not recommend this product for anyone to buybad camera
4656,1,the card reader didnt last long at all and i tried to get warranty support from ugreen and got a back and forth that i needed to return it to amazon amazon has a  day return policy so that wasnt gonna happen anyhow i ended up buying a card reader from a different brand because after several emails back and forth i still wasnt any closer to getting it replaced under warranty i would avoid this brand altogetherfailed after two months support wasnt helpful at all
12693,2,this works if you are making a half of a cup of dry rice if you try to make the full amount advertised it will overflow the first one i got broke completely out of nowhere luckily it was within  days so i was able to replace itits fine
3528,1,so i feel like i do pretty good research on things problems and cons and everything bought this a week ago charged it with the included cable and a quality  charger for the recommended  hours before first use fire it up and find out i have to download an app to use it fine got the app pretty simple and straightforward app  it proceeded to update the camera right away and so far so good after the update i finally got a look at the settings and noticed the battery level was around  chalked it up to the update and didnt really think much of it set it up to my liking and started using it battery got to about  after an hour of use i plugged it in sat down and waited for the cloud upload to finish messed around with the app a bit editing the videos and was pleased with the equality of the video and the appreturned several hours later to check on the camera and it was warm not hot but i found it odd the thing was warm at all i then noticed the battery had not charged at all it was still at  i plugged it into a usb charging block that displays power output and it would only charge with the camera on and then it only charges at  googled and found dozens of threads going back to release last year complaining about the same issue i tried all of the different tips and tricks that were suggested none of them made a difference manual firmware update holding the buttons for  seconds in every combination removing the sd card noticed different behavior on this one but no charging improvement factory reset etci would give this thing  stars if i could dysfunctional out of the box without being used at  black mini  charging issues everywhere
9581,5,value and inexpensive toogood for the price
2959,2,as many other reviews mentioned theres a lot weird spots on the filmweird spots on film
2017,2,cute camera but mediocre pictures not worth the moneymediocre pictures
9597,4,its cheap and beginner friendly for anyone who isnt familiar with making rice in a device like this water kept spilling out which was annoyingbeginner friendly
6981,2,good for the first few uses then just randomly stops working if you had told me a month ago to rate it i would have given it  stars but i was literally using it and all the sudden the error message came up changed the batteries twice and to no avail sad because i loved it but you are better off with the minibuy the mini dont waste your money
6779,2,i order this for deliver in the us the wall plug that came with it is a europe type of plugwrong power cord
8272,2,i bought this for my son as a gift for his  birthday i thought it would be great to get him his own since he is always taking pictures on my phone i chose this because of the reviews and how kid friendly it is i thought it was perfect he opened it yesterday and was able to take a few photos with my help before it stopped working it kept freezing so i decided to charge it and see where that got us now its saying there is no memory card when i clearly have put the memory card in it my parents have tried to get it to work and have the same problems which means its not just my operator error im very disappointed my son was so excited and now he keeps asking to play with his camera and it wont workextremely disappointing
3702,2,after charging all night light dies after  minutes of useafter charging all night light dies after  minutes of use
7184,1,a few days after my return window closed one of the slide buckles broke and i nearly dropped several thousand dollars in photography gear i reached out to the seller twice but have received no response just crickets never purchased from this companybroke within days seller wont respond
531,1,returned it it jammed during the first usereturned
5912,1,i was so excited about getting this camera and so highly disappointed the quality sucks you cant connect to wifi or bluetooth so you cant photos from your mobile device im most likely going to return it once i can figure out how to package it back up i dont like the quality or anything like it its not worth the money i paid forits a purchase i will always regret
7072,1,the camera came broken never even turned on after charging all day it makes me question the quality of the camera went and got a canon instead actually workedcamera arrived broken
16827,5,"just like other reviewers saying of course you can buy a  rice cooker but your rice really isnt going to taste anywhere as good as having a slightly better rice cooker honestlycuckoo is a korean manufacturer of rice cookers and just like tiger and zojurishi are fairly top notch what set this apart from the other two brands are the fact that cuckoo can keep the rice warm and fresh more consistently longer and also have a simplistic screen to read without having to worry about batteries some models have batteries that may require replacingoverall  would buy againnicely designed and modern looking"
14095,4,"love the color  handle and storage for the cordcupspoonhate that i find the control panel nearly impossible to readbeautiful sleek efficient easy to clean"
4878,1,my daughter received this camera set as a christmas gift she was ecstatic she used it a few times and the picture quality is just ok still she was enjoying the camera sadly the camera stopped working within the first two weeks she didnt even get to use most of the filmstopped working within  werks
11104,5,works greatwell made well priced
4317,2,i have had this bag since august and have been very careful with it only using it maybe once a week at most the front cover for the camera and lenses has already shows extreme wear with tears the bag is also not very supportive or comfortable when wearing it as a backpack i will be purchasing a different bag very dissapointed as the other reviews seemed to suggest this was a quality bagfabric wears too easily
5761,1,sent back as this was so smallsmall
7807,2,i definitely had a different expectation of this item i was so excited about these because i thought they were going to be a hard cover but no these are literally made out of the plastic folders you would use at school and just some film covers in it you can easily diy this for wayyyy less money than what you are paying forthis should be a value of  material
7562,1,this camera broke within a few months  i was unable to return itbroke
2597,1,so mad i bought this for a trip and got to use it  the button to snap pictures quit working unfortunately i didnt open it until the trip and didnt have the chance to return it dont waste your money buy an actual polaris camerabroke after two uses
3458,2,bought this for fun photos are fairly low quality color saturation is not good however it was priced appropriately more for kidslow photo quality
16224,5,big and easy to usebig boy
5568,1,this was a christmas gift and after taking a couple pictures it stopped working all together the lights that indicate an error wont even flash and the lens wont open at all did all the troubleshooting things we found online to try and fix it but nothing worked its dead in the water this camera cost too much for what it actually is hoping the seller will reach out to me after i sent them a message about this major problemstopped working after  hours
14773,5,great little cooker i make a variety of different recipes some of my favourites being mac  cheese soups vegetable dishes oatmeal and occasionally i make rice in it the manual isnt very helpful very poorly written but i was able to figure out the different settings and just make note in each recipe im concerned that i wont be able to ever find a replacement pot for it when it will eventually need it being used on a daily basis its sure to need replacing at some point tho is holding out well so far with major tlc its extremely easy to clean and isnt an eyesore sitting in its permanent spot on the counter i love that i can put the ingredients in just push a button and then let it do its thing without having to watch over it highly recommendcooks more than just rice
3361,1,it took  pictures and stopped working i sent this with my daughter to camp instead of disposable cameras thinking she would be able to take unlimited pictures unfortunately it was a disappointment and a waste of moneyit was a disappointment and a waste of money
4778,1,dead on arrival didnt work after a full chargedead on arrival 
9206,1,its junk no matter what i do to get a picture it wont develope im going to throw it awayits junk doesnt work even with new cards inserted always has to be formated
4532,1,screen went black white light no mastery what was done it would turn back on and it was fully charged returned to amazonit only worked for five minutes
3603,2,i purchased my mini  from a different source but if youre anything like me amazon reviews are usually one of the first places i go to see peoples opinions on products my unit lasted all of  months the battery will no longer take a charge and when it did it only lasted about  minutesish on medium settings  ive spoken with customer support and theyre about as helpful as the camera is reliable i have an old sessions that worked better than this there really is no benefit to buying this specific model size and weigh wise it only a tad bit smaller with no real upsidesave yourselves the headache and skip on this onegopro get rid of this potatoskip this one and buy the regular hero  if you must
9307,5,its really idiot proof game changer for a quick addition to any meal def recommendeasy and fast must have
13784,5,i dont eat much rice now days but i do cook rice occasionally and this is just perfect it was simple and easy to use and because i do have other rice cookers  cup  cup and  cup i know how to make rice i just needed a smaller one with a timer my  cup cooker does not have a timer but it cooks rice in under  minutes i prefer to use a timer because i can prepare ahead and the rice will be ready when i need it it is compact so it doesnt need much counter space and its small enough i can put it away in my cabinet when not in use absolutely love itabsolutely love this
786,1,i kept getting more blurry photos than clear ones no matter what i did if you dont buy the sandisk ultra  class  sdhc uhsi memory card you will only be able to take one photo and have to download it to your pc before you can take another picture my umx  cell phone does a great job compared to this camera and it was a free phone amazon returns is the only pleasure i had with this cameraits not worth your time
938,1,poor quality all arounddont waste your money
6669,1,was very excited when this came in originally seemed perfectly fine then no picture would come out after the flash now the camera isnt flashing at all nor does it seem compatible with the few different films that i have tried i would recommend spending a bit more for a product that worksdoes not work
14219,5,"this thing is amazing for  peopleand great price compared japanese brand rice cookermakes it so easy to cook rice just set it and forget it because it keeps the rice warm up too after finishing cookingit wis absolutely fantastic"
3197,1,this is a low cost product purchased by people like me who dont know very much about these things the manual is poorly written which dg must have known because they have provided a series of videos to try to explain its use however they are rife with holes in explanation and come off as commercials for the product more than anything eventually got the trigger to affect the speed light flash but would never control the power settings in manual mode as briefly shown in various videos then it stopped working alltogether after an hour resetting everything and resetting synch setting im certain ive exhausted a setting error issue id return this but i let it sit around for too long before discovering all of thisterrible support then the trigger failed
802,1,the set up for the ishare camera is just too involved most people including children  seniors dont need something complicated im very unhappy with this camera my last camera was a digital kodak i sure wish i had taken better care of it and i wouldnt be writing this review today i would not have ordered this inferior camera and i wouldnt have wasted my money or timehow complicated can the chinese make a camera
8234,2,picture quality is poor shakey and you really have to hunt for a frame you can use   camera is bulky and the ui awful the life app will crashes on connecting so again useless had this camera on a shelf and forgot about it until i got mount for the bike wish i wasnt so lazy and sent in back when i bought itjust need to find an alternative that has a long recording time 
4810,1,unfortunately i am finding out after purchasing that this camera is notorious for malfunctioning and has a short life span the life span on my camera was nonexistent as i have never been able to get the camera to take a single picture i have tried troubleshooting new batteries gone through several packages of new film and still no luck this camera is a novelty and an expensive piece of junk save your money for booze or something usefulbroken before use
9411,5,you wont regret your purchase it seems a little intimidating at first but its a great addition to our kitchen it looks great tooworth it
1397,2,there are no clear directions on how to connect it to the internet which was my whole reason for buying thisno directions
9361,5,comes with recipes no need to stand over a hot stove checking on the rice this automatic steamercooker is just the thing to dish up a tasty meal for a busy familysimple to use rice cooks perfectly
3712,1,there are scuffs on it new out of the box looks like it was returned or something the battery sucks too it wont stay in the battery mount it falls out easily and is a little loose makes the light flicker due to being too looselooks used
4202,1,when i put film in the camera it would print the first picture then not print anymore taken after changed the film and it did the same printed first picture taken then not the nextdidnt work
12692,5,this rice cooker was good only for  months and stopped working afterstopped working after  months
16969,4,"at the regular price id say this is a good unit on sale it was a great deal for what you get theni have never had a dutch oven never used one or needed one but i do like to slow cook and i do often do sauces and such on the stovemy first thought for this was to simplify my stove cleaning i have a new stove with stainless on top by the burners and while its a different stainless than the rest of it so its a bit easier to clean id still rather not have to sauces things that may bubble or boil having the option to not do those on the stove seemed a great optionwe sometimes do box meals since im a single dad and it turns out this was awesome for them added water to the sauce added noodles and let it ripand here is the only reason i gave it four stars rather than  there is no way in the middle of cooking to change anything i wanted to drop the temp for the last  minutes when it was just supposed to simmer on low but i had to cancel the current cook settings then set up a new manual cook job for the second halfi would prefer the ability to adjust that on the flythe plastic housing around the outside of the base never gets hot not even warm so theres no concern i feel about the countertop the top does get hot though and the handle on the lid does nothing to dissipate the heat so youll always need to have something handy to grab it there is nothing in the package here for that although they do include a couple small rubber grips you can place over the handlesthis is solid the top the crock its heavy and far more sturdy than the material my slow cookers crock is made fromi still dont know if ill dump the slow cooker in favor of this since the slow cooker i have uses a touch screen and lets me set more than simple things like high or low and the basic  or  hours but while it has more options i dont often need anything more than the basics since i invariably cook things over a  to  hour period when using them also i have the reynolds wrap bags to cook with the slow cooker so that i dont have to clean it but this was so easy to clean that i dont think that will be a factorbuttons were mostly consistent and only a few times did i have to press twice because it didnt registercord isnt that long but its no worse than my slow cooker so i didnt lose any lengthif you have a use for something like this i can say that its well made and solid and should do a good job with things you throw at it ill be trying out more things in here as time goes just to see what options it will end up adding to our menu options here for my son and ioutstanding when grabbed on sale"
13992,5,made an amazing batch of rice best rice cooker ive owned and have owned many easy to operateamazing rice cooker
3565,2,so on a fully charged battery it lasted about  min also go pro gets really hot this is my first one and imvery disappointed for allthe money i spent on this camerabatt life is crap to much money for so so quality
1366,2,i genuinely wanted to love this camera and take it everywherefor everything but like saying its name its an absolute pitasure you can easily press record and it does amazing work capturing everything around you however come post production time it will suck the life out of youi genuinely dont know where to even start with how much ive disliked this product solely for how non user friendly the app is just to get your videoif only they spent more time trying make editing easier instead of the endless cute and trendy express your inner vlogger junk i would be far more excited for itthe guided tutorial swipe this swipe that makes my want to use it for wiping withnot for the faint hearted
6481,2,i really needed a fill light to record videos at home i heard good things about these panel lights i though a rechargeable would be the best option for maneuverability but it turns out its terrible the light functions ok but the battery life is terrible i can never finish recording a single video without it dying and the time it takes to charge is ridiculously slow the worst part is the light does not function while it is plugged in it would be one thing to have a wireless light that lasts a decent amount of time per charge but the fact that this light is not capable of turning on while plugged in is an absolute deal breaker if youre looking for backlighting to record videos longer than  minutes dont bother with this oneterrible battery lifelong charge timedoesnt turn on while charging
2006,1,i bought an open package usedlike new  generation polaroid when it came time to charge it the charger didnt fit i compared it to the older model and it turns out they sold me a  generation gave me the box and and charger but ageneration  cameradont buy open package
8145,2, i knew the camera isnt good or will have issues however i bought it just because of its battery life i cycle few times a week and each ride takes me about  hours and this is the only camera out there that has long battery life i had to record everything on road in case of another accident which many bad drivers get into my line for no reason two female drivers already crashed into me twice in one month so i wanted to protect myselfthe camera stopped working but the light doesnt turn off at all and it has been on for  minutes and yet to turn off the camera first time used today only recorded  videos and each  min then stopped it makes  copies of same video which used the memory space for no reason the card is  gb and is already full which recorded  videos but some how the camera made  copies total  videos very confused the video image isnt clear but not horrible either its okay though the stability kinda ok but not fully im not satisfied with it because it broke down very fast with first time i have to get a better cameranot good
6064,1,photos were very poor quailitydont buy save your money and buy a better camera
550,1,i was so excited to get this camera it came with batteries included  within  minutes of experimenting with the camera it said the batteries were dead and the camera turned off tried a new set of batteries same result in less than a minute i thought kodak might be able to help me  but there is no way to call themi googled for customer service phone numbers  they were either not working numbers or went to the printer department or for commercial machines googling the website and searching customer service led to nonexistent pages its as if kodak doesnt existim so disappointed  this camera is going back immediatelybrand new doesnt work no way to call kodak
11168,5,very practical for small families and super cute toopractical
9705,5,make sure you give the meat playing time to cook before the rice put it in the top steamer basket let it drip down in the water and then cook your rice in that water worked great need a little bit more cooking on the chicken so make sure the chicken is fully cooked before you make your ricethis cooker is fantastic
1145,1,my son loved this camera at first but within a few weeks the batteries stopped holding a charge i have been in contact with the company and ive been in communication with amazon customer service neither has completed the replacement or refund even though customer service said they would take care of it because im a prime member not worth spending your money on highly disappointed with this product and with amazon on this oneworked for a few weeks
488,2,wth i cant use it keeps telling me to go to a website and i did download the thing and keeps saying not working go to the website  i want a new one that doesnt make me do thatim having problems using it call me to help
10339,5,"ive never really had a problem cooking rice on the stove so i never felt i needed a rice cooker i was concerned about taking up extra space in my cabinet for a device i didnt need i had heard so many good things about this particular rice cooker and the price was so reasonable i thought why not give it a trywell i have to say this is a handy little device i like the peace of mind of setting and forgetting i have made  batches of rice now and each one came out perfectly the first time i followed the instructions i rinsed the rice put in the water stirred and turned it on about  minutes later perfect fluffy rice the second time the only change i made was using chicken stock instead of water again perfect fluffy rice the third time i was in a hurry so i tried the rapid rice function according to the booklet i was supposed to have cooked rice in  minutes i didnt have rice in  minutes it still took  minutes i had forgot to rinse the rice first so it was a little sticker but still perfectly cooked i need to go back and make sure i didnt miss any steps in the rapid rice processthe book comes with recipes you can make complete meals in this cooker i havent tried the steaming options yet but you can steam veggies and proteins as well even while your rice is cooking i will be experimenting with that function in the future you also have the ability to cook other grains which i also have yet to tryi would like to mention you can cook rice quicker on the stove than in this rice cooker the real advantage here is the hands off set it and forget it peace of mind most meals that i would be making to go with rice take  minutes to prepare so the fact the rice cooker takes longer isnt an issue for mei did purchase the smaller size cooker option because i dont make large batches of rice at one time but there are larger size options available and finally yes you can cook rice in an instant pot but if you have your meal cooking in there you cant cook both at the same time in the same devicesuper easy"
4424,1,i currently have a nix advance  inch but wanted a bigger screen and wifi so i purchased this one i read the pixstar improved their display resolution because on their  inch it was  pixels and on the  inch it  so i bought this one instead of the nixplay  inch because pixstar was cheaper the pictures were washed out and had dull colors nothing like the pictures that are displayed on my nix  inch picture quality is very important to me so i packaged it up and sent it back immediately also some of the pictures didnt display fullyi played around with different cropping and still they wouldnt touch the ends of the frame normally at least  sides touch and the other  dont if you have a weird sized pic but  different pics didnt have any sides touching whats the point of having a larger screened frame when the pics arent larger on the display stupid guess ill have to splurge and try the nixplay  inch because im very happy with their picture quality on the  inchpicture quality is horrible
17092,5,i liked this machine from the moment it arrived easy to use with great resultsand an added surprise when i saw the steaming basket i can make rice and at same time steam my broccoli and salmon a great machine i recommend unqualifiedlyeasy to use rice cooker

226,2,so im one of those people that goes down the rabbit hole researching products for some reason i still dont know why as recent as  months ago someone posted about this being a must own camera and i bought itmistakefirst let me say my previous phone the samsung galaxy  ultra took better photosthat was the bar beat my phone i thought it had to beat the zoom right nopeokay well maybe the quality of the still photo nopedisplay features pricewell nono yes the phone is more expensiveso whyd i even buy it well prior to going on vacation i decided i wanted to have an actual camera to take because id be gone  weeks and wanted something with a zoom what i didnt want was to take my  dollar rig with me mainly because we were going to be traveling to nyc nj beaches and driving around to see family everywhere and i was afraid id leave it somewhere or have it stolen we were going to be driving around a lot summer hot car unfamiliar places places too familiar so i figured well heck my old olympus pen was great for stuff like that small form factor good quality and really cool features but id sold that years ago and missed it got some great pics with it theyre versatile little thingsthis is not its bulky heavy feeling the zoom lens is slow the display is old and grainy not only would it not hold up against a pen but the old nikon  and canon rebel tis bought used would be better optionsi think its time to call it on this camera and just say it was good back when but for the same price now it doesnt hold up specifically its zoom the number one feature this camera sells forlastly regarding photo quality i did take the sd card out and put it in my pc to see if the quality was better than what the screen was showing it was not also the reset delay between photos is atrociousas for bird photography which i dont do but this is popular for maybe youre laid back enough to deep dive in the settings and spend an ample amount of time making this camera work for you and maybe you get decent photos from it but theres no way unless mine was defective that out of the box anyone whos used to taking their phone out to snap a shot is going to be impressed with thisi submitted for return of this camera the day after i got it thats how unimpressed i wasskip it so outdated
2032,1,the pictures show up blurry the brightness is terrible and you have a  chance of the camera actually taking a semidecent photo super disappointed especially for the money i spentgarbage
17266,5,cooks rice amazingits big
11175,4,"i got this because it has a steamer basket its a very small steamer basket so weve only used it for some frozen mixed veggies so far it was very good the rice instructions made perfect rice and i was skeptic because my family has only used the finger trick to measure rice water but i was very pleasantly surprised  its also very easy to cleanthe only big con i have and it is a big one the keep warm setting after dinner i found my rice is actually cooking on the keep warm setting it became dry and the bottom was crusty there was even bits of crunchy rice i ate one bowl of leftover rice but had to throw approx one more bowl of rice out because it was horribly hard and crunchy im immediately putting it into a container nowit is also pretty small of a size its just me and fiancee in our house so its perfect for us but i cant imagine this will fit enough rice for a full familyhowever considering my previous rice cooker was probably way more expensive than this one i find it well worth my moneydo not use keep warm setting but very good rice cooker"
3040,2,cannot accept any type of sd card that is not  gb  really limits what you can do with itincompatible with larger sd cards
5472,2,i bought this to replace an old point and shoot digital i had been using for years i wanted something with a better zoom range and this seemed to fit the billi am not a photographer i dont care about iso settings and f stops and all the other details the pros tweek i wanted somthing i could set on automatic and get decent pictures out of but i wasnt expecting shots that could go on the cover of national geographicthe features this camera has are a bit overwhelming yet with all that tech my old point and shoot takes better pictures photographer friends have tried to help by telling me to check this setting and check that setting and change this and yadda yadda yadda again  im not looking for an education in photography i simply wanted something that can take decent photos with a nice zoom this camera is not thatbottom line if you are simply looking for a camera that will take pictures that look decent when shown full size buy something simple ive taken hundreds of photos with it various settingsmodes some are better than others none are as sharp as what my iphone can do or the cheap point and shoot i thought i was replacing can still dopictures are not sharp when viewed full size
9474,5,i just started making my own rice at home and this rice cooker is so easy to use i love it it is also extremely fast compared to using something like an insta pot which is what i was previously trying to usegreat for beginners
8844,1,i started trying the camera out as soon as i received it everything seemed to work fine except the flash the flash made an extremely loud rubber band popping noise that scared me every time it went off within one hour of use the flash stopped working all together im now trying to return it and the return process is more difficult than others im extremely upset with this and will never purchase another minolta item fyi ive been using cameras starting with film since the  returns should be easier when an item is received as defectiveflash stopped working within one hour of owning trouble returning
820,1,give me my money back cheap junkgive me my money back
14055,5,"i have been cooking and eating rice all of my life with the normal rice cooker way and never been so happy to cook rice in this oneits the best way to cook rice and healthierawesome productthe best way"
4875,2,cute camera my son loved it it broke on the first drop and cannot return it to amazon link directs you to fujis main webpage i purchased extra protective cases and leather carrying case with straps very disappointedcute camera broke immediately
592,2,picture quality is bad but the battery life is good used it for  days and charged it onceyou get what you pay for
7344,1,i originally purchased this device for help with my still life paintings i wanted to use this device to make my transfer to canvas shorter and more accurate but when i received this product i spent countless hours trying to use it properly it is easy to assemble but that is where the ease of use stops it took me a couple of days to actually get my project in view on the mirror part once i was able to see my object to make the image large on my canvas i had to lower the neck of the device almost to the canvas and because i have back issues i had to hovered over my canvas standing in a very awkward position to use this device i have only used it the one time i explained here above it is not worth the money total waste of money and timenot so easy to use
2008,1,product was ok minor scratches on the bottom an i didnt get the bundle i was promised a empty photo caseno pictures and just the body i knew it didnt come with a charger didnt know it didnt come with photos or i would have gotten the cheaper one basically what they gave me not what i payed forholding out
5303,1,the camera didnt function properly out of the box photos were partial washed out after one week of making adjustments not one photo came out completely after discussions with nikon i decided to return it to them for analysis and repair disappointed that amazon would ship a product in this condition still waiting to hear from nikondid not work out the box
9625,5,this is a basic cooker but it delivers perfect rice every time we were initially drawn to the higher priced multi function units but figured wed just end up with a bunch of expensive options we didnt use this unit is reliable easy to use cleans up in a flash and stores comfortable in our pot drawerperfect
3265,1,lens was certified factory refurbished dont know if that had anything to do with my problems or if its just a bad lens i couldnt get it to focus properly used autofocus and had problems focused manually and had problems it was hit or miss as to whether or not it would focus i have a tamron  and just bought a sigma  both of these lenses are heavy compared to the nikon  yet i have no problems getting a clear sharp photo using them handheld i have other lower end nikon dx lenses and theyre great so maybe this particular nikon  was just a bad one that slipped through the cracks its a lower priced lens so while it may not seem fair to compare it to my other lenses that cost  as muchthis lens wouldnt focus correctly at all even on a tripod pretty confident that even though it was refurbished it was still defective im currently shooting with a nikon  refurbished but
4857,1,i guess this is a common problem i should have read the reveiwsonly received  boxes of film not 
8537,2,not happy with the fact that the battery died after just five cartridges of film and i had to slit open the camera case to change the battery because the lens froze up when the battery died thats  down the drain for the camera case and nearly  down the drain for the film that got ruinedokaybut battery doesnt last long
4108,1,camera works well though a little less sharp than i expectedmy main problem is the arlo app it logs me out everytime so i have to sign in anytime i want to check a video will update if this changesedit i took away the  star just realized my camera has been offline for  days i wasnt alerted or anything there was some suspicious activity in my yard today and i wanted to double check the footage which is how i found out about the camera being offline for so longi cant get the camera to go back online now despite the station camera and router being all within  of eachother pretty annoying ive reset the hub tried to sync again nothingedit   camera still wont sync im pissed because i tossed the packaging after  months which means i cant return it bad decision on my part i knowi was hoping a customer service rep could answer my question i was  in the queue with an estimated wait time of  minutes for about  minutes before finally giving upit should not be this hard to sync the thing but it is infuriating press the sync button on the side of the hub for  seconds until light blinks green and then hold the sync button on the camera for  seconds easy righthere is the reality i push the sync button for  seconds nothing if i hold it longer the usb starts flashing which means it is useless for  minutes if i tap the sync button once it will flash again if i hold for  seconds as the directions tell me to i get nothing also it is telling me to wait for a green flash but the standard lights are sort of in between green and yellow is this the green color im looking for or is this a slightly different yellow flash that means something else who knows no info on this anywhereso anyways even if i get the yellowgreen flash as soon as i touch the sync button on the camera i get amber flashes meaning failed sync every single time reset everything try again same result over and over and overagain nothing should be this hard to synccamera works well though a little less sharp than 
2558,1,it wont last that long at first it seems good but after using it for couple of times it doesnt hold its charge not good at allwaste of your money
5786,2,i was excited about this camera because the reviews about the quality for the price but i will be returning this camera the bad reviews about the wifi connection were true for me too since i couldnt connect to my computer to work on the photos i then bought an hdmi cable to transfer photos to my computer because it doesnt come with any connector cables but the cable was the wrong size i think im just going to buy a new camera instead trying another cable purchase because the wifi connect should just work in the first place i will say it did work to transfering the photos onto my phone when i installed the app so that works same wifi so no reason it shouldnt work on my computer but that doesnt suit my purposewifi connection doesnt work
6768,1,i received the package the day before a trip to mt rushmore so naturally opened everything put it in the backpack case and began using it on the trip the camera seems fine does its job but some of the attachments such as the lens hood will only work with the camera lens not the telescoping or wide view attachmentsthe name of the camera the  was throwing me off and looked at what i had ordered and realized it was not the camera i wanted upon further research the  is an inferior camera with  mp instead of the  i was supposed to get smaller view screen scored lower in nearly every category with consumer reviews and every search i did including going in person to local stores this camera is a minimum of  cheaper in every scenario and sometimes more including on amazon but yet i still paid the cost of the eos  rebel  i did not have another option to get a camera in time for the trip i continued to use it for someone looking for a bargain camera it works fine but is only getting  due to inferior camera replacement especially at the same costnot what was ordered
8650,1,review may be rewritten ifwhen a replacement arrives returnreplacement procedure underwaycamera was defective and produced terrible image quality this was not simply a blurry image i could fix that easily by staying still this was a something in the camera is broken kind of image attached photos are of the same shot angle one with flash one without i know this is not the way this camera normally works as i purchased two others different colors and they both worked finedid not work

4003,2,its a very cute gift for kids unfortunately the quality is just not there one of them turned off and never came back on the first day we had them the picture quality while i didnt expect to be amazing is less than bad the volume for the videos is almost nothing as wellbad quality

8639,1,after purchasing two of these exact cameras no luck ion functioning my daughter wanted to bring a point a shoot camera on vacation this summer it was near impossible to put batteries in i actually went to local best buy for assistance and we broke the battery compartment attempting to put batteries in on the first camera purchased a second and this one did not work was able to struggle and get batteries in then it powered on and nothing was visible unable to take a single photo also what needs to be mentioned here is although the camera will cost about  bucks you need to purchase a mini sd card and batteries so you ultimately can expect to pay at least  for something that does not work no returns or refunds this is the worst camera on the market do not waste your moneycamera does not work  battery installation near impossible
8280,1,missing parts packaging was disturbed camera did not work at all couldnt navigate the menu it was stuck on the same option and we could not reset it in short its a piece of junk that isnt worth my  im sorry i bought it and my daughter is disappointedjunk

7015,2,everything else seems fine except for the pen it had so much residue in on both sides that it had that the thing was worse than useless i shouldnt have used it at all the fine brush has some oily residue while both sides of the interchangeable part had some kind of glue that comes off when you rub it against glass which is especially hard to clean i was even very meticulous as to not touch the very edge of the cleaning part i just really needed a cleaning kit and a hardshell bagcase i simply will never buy this product again just because of that cleaning penwould not use the cleaning pen it comes with

11213,4,"i like this rice cooker for how cute and compact it is i use it just for myself so the portion sizes are great and the instructions are a little bit confusing the way its written but i think you will get the hang of it quickly now for the practicality of this product compared with the price you can definitely get better for cheaper trust me i love that it comes with a cup and spoon but it doesnt have a holder for the spoon in fact you can get a  rice cooker that cooks  times the portions of this one that can cook the same things and will actually hold the spoon this one is really not that special its just cute and i am not ashamed to admit i got this for that reason alone it just looks so good in my kitchen and i get to show it off for friendstldr if you really just need a rice cooker to get the job done you can definitely spend your money elsewhere if you want something that looks good in your kitchen and you only need small portions get thisawesome for aesthetic maybe not worth the "
13904,5,my boyfriends family came to visit from taiwan and we needed a rice cooker with a larger capacity than our aroma cooker at first i was skeptical due to all the reviews that stated the rice cooker took an hour to make white rice but that simply isnt true there are multiple options that result in different cooking times including white brown steamed etc but the cooker makes perfect white rice in  minutes with the quick mode the rice is soft fluffy and taste great my only issue is that the lid moves slightly when its closed but it hasnt caused any problemsquick easy and delicious rice every time

4188,1,well buyer beware of these packaged up kits  the camera didnt work we opened it up and it looked like it had already been opened im outside the return window so shame on me we replaced batteries more than once but all it would do was spit out unused pic after unused pic one immediately after the other until the entire  was used up after much online troubleshooting this could be due to crummy batteries or a bum camera  at which you have to take it to a repair clinic considering this camera retails at target for  its definitely not worth repairing since this was a birthday present to my daughter i bought the new one at target and it immediately worked no problem the package does come with all it claimed it would contain and all other items appeared new but the camera was nonfunctional just buy your camera separately from a reputable resellerdo not buy this package  risk of camera not working

11927,5,"i had my old rice cooker for a few years now and wanted to upgrade it so when i went looking for suggestions i heard about zojirushis i decided to choose this one over the  cup one since  cups is plenty enough for me and the feature set looked solid after my first rice cook with  cups the rice came out beautifully the inner container was easy to clean very spacious and had clear water lines for the type of rice you put inside i also love that you can change the time and also theres music played when startingfinishing the rice if you can stomach the cost its worth itupdatednew reviewi was looking for an upgrade from my instantpot from  years ago and heard the general consensus is that z is one of the best if not the best brands for rice cookers i decided to save up for a few months then splurge for the z rice cooker based on the recommendationsi got the  since i will almost never need to make that much even with meal preppinglove the multiple cooking options easy to use buttons with the cute musical tone that announces when it finishes never had any issues i also like that it shows the time even if it is not plugged in and also when cooking shows the time remainingsince i live in an apartment in a small space i love the retractable power cord since it makes for easy storagethe rice cooker and internal bowls are easy to clean just soap water and airdryeven if youre looking to purchase your first rice cooker i recommend this highly buy this once and satisfy your rice cooking needs for the next decade ill probably use it for way longer than that but  for  years of elegant and easy rice cooking is an easy buy for megreat rice cooker"
10470,4,"the product works fine if you use the correct ratio of rice to water when i followed the instructions in the booklet using the given measurement cup it was way too much water and my rice was inediblejust use a ratio of  cup rice to   cups water and it will work finedont follow the given instructions"
4731,1,camera worked great until we replaced print paper then camera never printed afterward granddaughter was so excited about being able to see instant printed photo needless to say it broke her heart when she wasnt able to print anymore pics after first roll was gone it was the most expensive camera available and wow what a disappointment to have it just stop workingyou dont always get what you pay for

15313,5,"as i sit here eating my nice fluffy rice i think to myself i should leave a review for my rice cooker tomorrow is march   and i bought it april   so its just shy a year old and still works awesomely so its no onemonthdudbang for your buck this little thing slaps i have made sooooo much food in it tons of pulled pork stews butter chicken soups broths and of course riceit has a pretty decent capacity i was able to make enough beef bourguinon in it to feed four people one night with a little leftoverits not super hard to clean just make sure you dont forget to haha pay attention to the insides of the rubber ring on the bottom of the lid especially if youre like me and keep overfilling the dang thing lol can be a little harder to clean but you can basically fill it up almost to the top and it cooks fine just gets the lid messyonly critiques is that the nonstick inside scratches easily so do not use anything metal to stir or serve out of it and that the settings are a little vague and the instructions dont really detail much regarding temperature i think the slow cook setting is a normal slow cookers equivalent of the high setting i know it makes a pork shoulder forkpullable in  hoursoverall i am pretty broke thanks covid pay cuts and so am immensely glad i went with this rice cooker versus the  alternative i was looking at its a little champbang for your buck this rules"
6951,1,terrible quality products do not buy both cameras we got did not work first camera would not produce any photos it would just make noises and destroy the film changed batteries changed film still did not work returned first camera got a second camera which had a similar problem it would double or triple expose every photo we changed batteries and film  times tried everything in the manual and online still does not work extremely expensive to go through all that film and extremely frustrating to go through all that effort and backandforth and still not have  proper photo getting new film took so long we cant return and now were stuck with a camera that doesnt work and over  lost total scamdoesnt work dont buy
9524,5,"this product is very easy to use instructions are simple for loading rice and water there are two minor issues i would like to see resolved but in no way detract from this devices operation once you have loaded the rice pan with water and rice the next step is to press the front lever to cook the rice but caution is needed here because there is a tendency for the rice cooker to tip over as the lever is pressed a simple fix for the manufacturer is to add a foot peg to the bottom front of the cooker otherwise hold the cooker in the back as you press the cook lever minor issue as the rice cooks it tends to boil the water thru the steam release hole in the cover making a bit of a mess on the table surface where the rice cooker sitsoperation"
6967,1,ive purchased two of these and both have broken within months of purchasing the first one started leaking light so pictures would come out completely white the second one just stopped turning on the only reason i purchased the second one was because i have a ton of film for this camera i was outside of my return window on both of these so i am unable to get my money backthe build quality is incredibly cheap i am gentle with my camera and still had these issues i highly recommend choosing a different company like polaroidpurchased two and both broke
16957,5,i didnt know it was that big but it works lovely and it makes the rice very well no issueslove
6963,1,loved the camera but the first one i ordered on  broke the second day i used it lens just came off the track and wouldnt open when you turned on the camera amazon was able to replace it for immediately which was very convenient it worked for another nine months and the same thing happened in september  now it doesnt look like i have the option to replace through amazon and im trying to file a warranty claim with fujifilm extremely inconvenient would love some help getting this fixed and would advise anyone to be cautious buying fun to use but extremely low qualitycheap qualitybroke twice in  months

6958,1,i ordered two cameras through the same link a couple months ago for my wedding that is coming up this weekend both new i just opened them up to test them prior to the wedding and one of them was new and worked fine the other was very obviously used and the gears inside were jammed so it didnt work at all pretty disappointed especially with my wedding being in two days check your boxesi ordered a new camera and received a clearly used camera that doesnt work
6905,2,editupdatethis is important so i had to come back to state it do not leave this camera in your messenger bag or backpack if it turns on by accident the lens will try to open up and may jam this will ruin the camera i tried to search for ways to fix it but ultimately just returned the camera the quality and everything was great hence im still leaving it as  stars but make sure you dont put this in your bag where it may turn on i got a full refund and ill be buying a later version once they fix this issueedit  had recommended this early on to a friend they now also have a broken camera for the same reason i think its dumb how this can happen as its not unreasonable to put it in your bag its not like we are jostling it around a slightly wrong angle in the bag can cause the lens to open  camera to turn on and boom your camera is busted i really hope they fix this because theres not that great of an alternativeoriginal reviewamazing product i have started using this camera as my main camera aside from sometimes using my cell phone i love that photo albums are making a comeback my friends at parties love it and constantly ask for photos definitely worth it note i am a millenial and this kind of retro throw back is inqualitythe camera itself does not feel cheap it feels like a strong plastic but much lighter than my old polaroid that my father had given me the photos are what one would expectutilityas a photographer i mainly use my dslr however when im not on shoots i had mainly used my cell phone this camera due to the nostalgia for film brings me excitement its nice not knowing how every shot will turn out the waiting time is worth it every image seems unique and the imperfections feel humanmillenial loved old camera now its broken
533,1,dont work when recievedone star
7735,1,i liked that this camera was small enough and light enough for my  year old to use picture quality was just ok and buttons easy enough to push however after using it twice my son dropped it on the carpet from  feet up and now its unusable cant even turn it off its like the screen is busted see picture i want expecting a whole lot but i expected better than this i say dont waste your moneywaste of money
3913,2,has a common defect as seen in the  star reviews inside motor will not dispense or react once button is depressed upon research you will find that there are a set of blinking lights on the camera forums will tell you that it needs a specific alkaline battery but once you replace it and still have the same issue the fault is now a mechanical issue and to take to a repair shot of deal with fuji directly umm no im sending this pos backbroke in five days not user error
7350,2,found it difficult to use so far does not enlarge as much as i expected may have to build a special stand to clamp it to ata higher level than the table top need some useful pointers may have to look for a tutorial on u tubetough little gadget to use and it looked so easy
11304,5,"ive never owned a rice cooker but i have struggled to make rice on the stove this solved the issue of not having to monitor the rice for doneness and not burning plus it will keep your rice warm for hours if need be i def did not leave it on over night by accident and the rice was still being kept warm the next morning totally not i love it it does make only about the  servingsdepending on your serving size im thinking like a smaller serving size of rice but thats all i need out of  batch would recommend to a friendlove how easy it is to use and how cute it is on the counter"
2696,1,it was supposed to be a gift it was opened after couple of months and the screen doesnt work at all and it cant be replacedreturned since the one month return time had already passedthe screen doesnt work at all dont buy

17146,4,honestly i read everything the product offered and it looked awesome however it was a little small for what i was looking for so i decided to return it i tried to look for a bigger one but the price difference was crazy  ill probably end up buying a bigger version of this it looks awesome but it was a little small for me
12913,1,it worked great and i was pleased with it but about a month later it just stopped working doesnt turn on at allworked great at first
8171,2,risk the wifi ssid is fixed and cannot be changed and the wifi password is generic factorydefined and cannot be changed all drift ghost xl cameras have the same wifi password which means if you have the wifi on anyone can connect to it i contacted drift support and their response was basically dont worry its short range and someone else cant connect if youre connected um sorry bub thats not a reason to ignore basic security practicessecurity vulnerability
14860,5,great use like  cups because the other i have only have  cupsgreat use
17590,5,first of all im asian and have eaten rice my whole life that said im kind of a rice snob after  years my national fuzzy logic rice cooker needed to be replaced not because it no longer made great rice but because the nonstick coating on the pot wore off and the rice would burn sooner when warming with great sadness i began my search for a new rice cooker after checking out all the major brands and even some i had never heard of i decided on this zojirushi  i am totally glad that i did makes all kinds of different rice and can make other stuff too warming function works well there are a ton functions i havent even figured out yet to me the best part is that this rice cooker is super easy to clean dried rice just falls off the nonstick pot and it rinses clean without scrubbing wipe down the cooker and you are done since i use it everyday easy cleaning is a plus love itgreat rice cooker no regrets
3699,1,the thumbscrew attachment is tight in the camera but the stem that holds the lite up wobbles like a bobble head if you moved the camera too fast it would snap off it will not hold the weight of  lites as it claims not worth the money not sure how long this plastic mount will last just another  wasted on low quality products sold in the us oh the lite burned bright for an hourcheap quality
9090,1,bought these to take pictures for my trip decided to take a couple of pictures to test them out and this is what i got my films are expiredexpired films
14312,5,i was worried about the positive reviews being all bots but i figured i give this rice cooker a chance while the removable parts might be daunting to someone it turns out they are very easy to clean if you just wipe out the steam after use the rice settings work nicely i will test the rolled oats sometime and maybe update but given the good experiences with rice so far im sure it will be fine i did take to heart the warning some people gave about the keep warm setting possibly burning rice so i just unplug when its done cooking and the rice has been fluffed easy to care for if you make the effort after each usei think its decent
10467,5,i absolutely love this little rice cooker i dont tend to make a lot of rice when i cook and this is perfect for making enough rice for me and my husband the compact design makes it easier to store in the cabinet since it doesnt take a lot of space if you dont need to cook a lot of rice and youre only cooking enough for about  servings this is perfecttiny but mighty
5095,1,this camera didnt last but one day longer than the  day return window they are tiny they are of poor quality my heartbroken niece was so disappointed that despite the good care she gave the camera the screen no longer workabsolute garbage
4772,1,didnt even last two months wont charge or turn onlook elsewhere
17477,5,we are a family of  and eat rice just about everyday we had used a very basic standard rice cooker for years and it finally stopped working we read reviews and talked to friends and decided to get this zojirushi rice cooker we could tell the difference the first time we used the rice actually tastes better and has the perfect texture that we normally only get in korea or japan it is extremely easy to use right out of the box the directions are clear and succinct with a press of a button you can make many different styles of rice we mainly eat short grain white rice but have used it for brown and jasmine rice too with great success the markings in the cooking container are large easy to read and make measuring the water to rice ratio easy and very accurate the display is clear and easy to understand and the buttons are easy and feel well made the programming and warming function is great so having the rice right when you want it is easy too it is also very easy to clean we highly recommend this rice cookerthis rice cooker really upped our meals
13356,5,it came in super fast and more amazing in person it even looks bigger than i thought and a great price i love this brand and everything came factory sealed and perfect conditionbest rice cooker ever
8774,1,followed the directions and pics are very unclearpics r not clear
14484,5,this is a great product perfect rice every time ive only used it for rice so i cant comment on its other capabilitiesi love it
1706,1,brought this for my teenage sons birthday in july tidal waste of money it wont read the sd cards so he cannot save take or upload pics wish i could return itdont buy
2585,2,i loved the camera but i had issues with some of the film more than half of my pictures have come out blank or they are very faint and never finish developing i also have issues with the battery life of the camera i have replaced the battery  times already and i have barely had it for a month film doesnt work sometimes
6161,1,everythingeverything
7815,1,album is thin cheap plastic ordered and it arrived broken ordered a replacement and it arrived broken spin of the album is not sturdy returning replacement and not ordering again would not recommendcheap quality do not buy
4981,1,the photo quality is hit or miss mostly miss for the amount we paid for this camera and the cost of each photo this camera is not worth the money the lighting is either too bright for the photo to show up or theres a line through the photo my daughter stopped using it because the photos didnt turn out unfortunately now were stuck with it because were past the return date which is upsetting because the camera was hardly usedphoto quality is terrible
14286,5,"just cooked white rice and it was so easy i love to cook and this rice cookersteamer is of high quality and easy to use ive purchased products from the high priced brand name and yes they are good but for the pricefood outcome this toshiba rice cooker is a great deal i was looking to order the higherpriced toshiba model but it wasnt in stock and i have not regrets with this onethe white rice i made was tender and fluffy i read the owners manual before cooking it was simple and straightforward the clean up was a breeze i even made room on my counter to keep it out looks like a mini boombox very cute im ready to try other types of rice and recipes perhaps the only improvement couldve been a recipe booklet ive heard you can make cakes soups etc time to search onlinevery happy with this productawesome deal"
16768,4,after reading the instructions i tried to make rice and definitely had too tinker with it a little to get it just right now that i have the formula down it works perfectly also very easy to clean which is a big win with a lot of products like thisgreat after a little trial and error
8446,1,picture quality is too bad it maybe has to do with my camera but i cant imagine that any camera that uses this photo paper wouldnt produce image similar to the images on the packagethe color of this photo paper is far below my expectations
7319,1,i bought this camera around  months ago yesterday i tried to turn on the device and i couldnti tried whit all the steps in the official page in gopro and nothing happened i need to figure out this problem as soon as possiblewhat may i doi bought this camera around  months ago yesterday 
8499,1,save yourself the time and effort i read all the reviews snorted at those who complained about the e error and thought i wouldnt be the one who had to deal with that ive now gone through two order processes and both cameras were defective straight out of the box im not ready to say goodbye to fujifilm but definitely the instax mini  not buy this camera
2824,1,i was so excited for this camera and technically had everything i was looking for once i finally got it charged i was surprised to find out the screen was broken so disappointing since i bought this for a once in a lifetime trip and my phone camera would not have been good for now i have a broken camera i purchased that i cant even usearrived broken
3463,2,i got this camera for my daughter followed every step correctly but still doesnt print picturesdoesnt print picture
7703,2,i didnt expect a magic from kids  device but i expected to get reasonable picturebut unfortunately picture is really noise even at day light lit room and dont even try to upload taken picture to your computer  picture quality is awful i guess its a  sensor with software interpolation thats difference between jpeg image at lowest resolution  and highest resolution  jpeg has a lot of ghosts pixelizations etc absolutely unviewable on a computer displaydont believe in shown  spec nothing even closerbtw no even digital zoom as well which even cheaper cameras havewill be returnedpicture quality is awful dont buy this device for 
2215,1,i really enjoyed it when it first came in and we were able to use it once was going to use it today and got it out of my office and set it up just to plug it in and it not work at all i did not expect it to last forever but for the price i expected it to work more than just  time i contacted customer support and they want me to buy a new light even though it is eligible for replacement until march of   time then breaks
17603,5,always wanted one but couldnt afford the regular price so i snagged it when price dropped my family loves the rice more than ever even my  year old can make the rice and it tastes amazing because of the cookerbest rice cooker ever
9367,5,the pot liner is nonstick and very easy to clean the steamed rice  is delicious you can choose the softness or hardness of the rice according to your preference you can make your favorite rice by experimenting a few timesrice cooker
7339,1,i was so excited about the product and became so frustrated that i didnt get it to work looked at videos and tried different angles with no effect i dont know what i do wrong just sadso difficult to use
17160,5,for the past month ive only used my instant zest for steel cut oatmeal compared to the stovetop this little pot is so much more convenient and has never let me down once i worked out the best watertooats ratio it produced very consistent results i used to take time to cook on the stovetop if i didnt tend the pot carefully the oatmeal would come out too thick or even cook to the bottom of the pot now i fill my zest first thing in the morning push a button and go about my morning in  minutes i have perfect breakfast every time it beeps when it is ready and keeps the oatmeal warm until you are ready i only rated  for cleaning because the inside top plate you have to wipe with a dishrag i wish it was as easy to remove and wash as the nonstick cooking pot i did not rate versatility because i havent tried any other food in it yetset it  forget it
203,1,the mic on this camera is trashdont waste your money
13769,5,i have been looking for a rice cooker for some time i kept burning my rice this inexpensive gem is easy to use easy to clean and makes great rice i think its a real findits really great
3781,2, there is no lense protection other that the bag which doesnt lend itself to taking spur of the moment  the zoom is terrible my husbands  year old lower pixel camera takes better shots than this new one  it works ok for every day use but i dont plan to take it on vacation with me for a larger megapixel camera the photo quality is nothing to get excited aboutsave your money look elsewhere
1038,1,the camera does not work i would have been happy with low quality pictures on my vacation so atleast i could have memories but it did not work i took  picture and the memory was full there is nowhere to insert a memory card unrealcheapest piece of work ive ever bought im extremely disappointedthe camera does not work i am extremely disappointed
3200,2,i dont want to write about its lighting qualities read other reviews for that i just want to say that it took me more than two hours to set this up the flash and the radio were not pairing it was a bad experience make sure you know how to do that before purchasing itdifficult to setup
14276,5,super easy and perfect rice every time love itdidnt know what i was missing
3680,1,battery does not charge i believe i was given a bad battery or charger no charger will charge the battery it wont charge at all waste of money lost  bucks  lost money for the event i was supposed to be shootingbattery is obsolete
16868,5,thick metal on bowl is way better than zojirushi models in the same price range i recommendworks perfect for one serving size
4233,1,i got what i paid for a piece of trash i wasnt expecting a super great camera i wanted a simple point and shoot as a backup to my phones camerabut this camera doesnt even take average photos all of the photos are blurrynot worth buying
1226,1,bought this for my daughter to take on a girl scout trip and the screen broke with in  hrs extremely disappointedabsolute trash do not buy
11046,5,next time i want to get the next larger size cooks great rice
10464,5,ive made soupscasseroles and sauteed meats in the rice cooker and they come out delicious there is no timer but i set a timer and go about my day i love the warm function as it keeps meals warm but never dried out this rice cooker is well worth the money and theres lots of recipes on line for making things from breakfasts to dinnersworks perfectly for small servings
17313,5,this is a wonderful device and youll love it more if you buy it at costo for about  lessbuy it at costco
9303,4,need more optionsconvient and easy to use
6086,1,so  i got this for my daughters wedding for oct we get ready to load the film only to discover the whole insides were missing not cool  no photo booth pictures for her wedding for her memory book im just now reviewing all the purchases we made and this was the biggest disappointmentlame  missing insides
13791,5,has useful settings for various kinds of rice mixed grains and beans versatile and everything cooks perfectlycan cook a variety of items
4000,1,poor quality pictures not worth the moneyits stop working
14087,5,within the first week i made white rice mixed grains quinoa brown rice wild rice and lentils chicken and mushroom congee porridge and eggs and all have come out flawlesslylike the hard boiled eggs were perfect i want to try lowering the time to see if i can get perfect soft boiled eggs as well just amazing after using the  one switch rice cookers for most of my life this is the perfect size for  people and doesnt take up too much space i debated about getting a larger model which would be great to make larger portions and the larger models hade steam baskets but i figured for what i typically do i didnt need the larger rice cooker this was the right price point for the quality and functions i wanted very satisfiedexcellent small rice cooker that just works
2724,1,i read all the negative reviews but decided that i would give this camera a chance big mistake not only did it take blurry photos even on the most sensitive settings it was very difficult to program ive been using a canon powershot camera for years but recently dropped it an broke the screen i was hoping this camera would be a good replacement for documenting tenant move out inspections on rental properties ive been using a point and shoot camera for decades and thought the other reviewers were not as experienced as i was wrong this camera is trash do yourself a favor find something else i know there arent many quality point and shoot camera savailable anymore since cell phones all have cameras but im going to keep lookinglisten to other reviews and dont buy this camera
4760,1,i got this product less than  months ago and it stopped working but the red lights is still ondoesnt work
17351,5,"and if you want a rice cooker youll basically never go wrong buying a zojirushithis is a   cooker i bought it as a replacement for an older zojirushi micom rice cooker the bowl was starting to get worn which isnt too surprising because that model has been discontinued for ten years and the rice cooker probably gets used three or four times a week aside from that though the old one still worked perfectly after having cooked probably over a quarterton of rice my initial impression is that the nonstick finish on the  bowl feels harder and glossier than the bowl on my old cooker and will probably last longerzojirushi has three basic tiers of rice cookers now my previous cooker was a model from the bottom tier this model is the second tier which features induction heating in order to more evenly heat the cooking rice from all sides and has a more extensive menu of rice cooking options my old cooker basically had only three cooking profiles  white brown and porridge this one offers multiple firmness choices for white rice two different cooking profiles for brown rice a specific setting for sushi rice as well as porridge sweet rice quick rice and more the top tier also features pressure cooking consider it if you live above five thousand feet altitude denver say or almost any city in wyoming if you live below  feet you probably dont need itas usual the zojirushi does a magnificent job of cooking rice add rice using the provided cup add water to the matching line salt as desired close the lid and cook it will give you a running countdown estimate right from the start of how long it expects the cooking process to take remember to stir and fluff the rice using the provided paddle if youre cooking longgrain rice that should have separate fluffy grains if youre cooking shortgrain nishiki or calrose rice to make say onigiri you probably wont want to do thatit also does a great job reheating cooked rice even though there is no reheat function on the menu just put your rice into the bowl close the lid hit start and wait itll start out displaying the time for the full cooking cycle but expect reheating to actually take about half thatill repeat my initial comment youll basically never go wrong buying a zojirushi the only question is which zojirushi two technical thug thumbs up for the  lets start with its a zojirushi"
11111,4,i like my rice cooker it is very easy to use it is also very helpful when being busy all the time just make sure that you rinse your rice several times before cooking also make sure that you measure your rice alsorice cooker
2566,1,not worth the money broke after a week of useours stopped printing after a week of use
4201,1,the camera lens was broken within two pictures its internal because externally i see nothing wrong the pictures come out weirdly morphed super frustrated that i cant even use my camera i knew i shouldve tested it before my vacationbroke within a few uses waste of money
1800,1,the light nonstop flashes i can never take photos ive gotten like  photos the time ive tried using this camera it looks cute but it definitely does not worki wish it worked
8769,2,a cute gift but the picture quality is terrible and the photos are very smallnot great
4665,1,failed to read after  months of light usei emailed customer service and never received a response if youre looking for quality and or insurance this is not the place or productnot worth the  i paidthe free ones i have received from other brands still work after yearsstopped working in  months unresponsive customer service
4958,1,absolute junk bought this for a vacation trip has been charging since i started the trip turns on for a very brief moment then shuts off in order to return it i either have to use ups  an adult has to be present when its picked up  picked up where im traveling no local ups where i am at or i could put it in an amazon locker but i cant print a label and there is no close amazon locker very disappointed and out quite a bit of money also no camera for my tripjunk
2888,1,in spite of the green charging light the battery didnt charge and the camera therefore would not operatei sent it back waste of my timedidnt work
5209,1,the product arrived apparently used the viewfinder was scratched the sd card was not in its case the cord was loose and everything fell out of the box when opened it was an insult to my intelligence to think i wouldnt noticeused
4988,1,it stop working after  useafter one use it went bad
1227,1,this camera has no auto focus apparently you can take pictures of people and thats about it i was looking for a point and shoot that has auto focus so i can record my jewelry for insurance purposes this is not the camera for that project this has cool lighting effects and i like that it makes a sound to let you know its on off taking a photo unfortunately i need it to take pictures at different focal lengths yes i tried standing back  taking a photo with the zoomthis is going back darn it got here fast it is a pretty lavender color it came with a  gb micro sd card charger and cord plus a carrying strap and a nice little cover i need to read the descriptions a little bit more closely no where does it say autofocusdisappointing
4362,2,i purchased two of these frames so the below review is my consistent experience on both framesthis frame should be much better since it is one of the more expensive ones on the marketpicture quality is just fair your beautiful highres and  pictures are not going to be impressive on this large screenas other reviews have noted terrible remote you have to be within a few feet of the frame and pointing it exactly at the bottommiddle of the frame to get a response and you cannot press simultaneous buttons quickly as it will not register i cannot say enough about how frustrating this experience is trying to use the push buttons on the back of the frame are not a good workaround this alone is a good reason not to buy the frame as everything takes an agonizingly long timethe interface as mentioned in dozens of reviews is not intuitive and seems like its  years old coupled with the horrible remote control this frame might just drive you crazywhy in the world did they try to make this frame do music radio reminders games calendar and calculator no one buys a digital picture frame for that it makes an already poor interface even harder to manage that development time would have been better spent perfecting the basics of just loading and showing picturesthe transitions are slow and clumsy they jitter as if the frame doesnt have enough memory to quickly and smoothly get to the next picturethe random play algorithm is terrible it will play many pictures over and over while never getting to others i see many other users are having this same experience when i googled it for a solutionmanaging pictures from the various sources internal memory usb sd card email inbox cloud services is very counterintuitive due to the terrible interface this begs the question of why they put such a minuscule amount of internal memory into such a huge picture frame i have device a tenth of the size of this frame with  the memorythis frame really does none of the basics that you expect from a frame very well i have owned  or  other older cheaper frames i would rate a few of those higher than this newer more expensive framedo yourself a favor and read through the   and  star reviews if you see the same complaints over and over then be smart and consider that in your purchase decisionvery underwhelming for the price
12130,4,just a perfect size for me very easy to learn how to use it only one thing is takes to long time to cook white rice it take one hour to cook  or  of ricetake long time to cook
5816,2,canon should ashamed of their wifi app for ios  does not work check out the reviews in the app store some are a couple years old and the app still doesnt work my iphone sees the camera connection point but the app doesnt if you are hoping to share your photos easily via wifi as claimed no luck expected better from canon looking at sony for my next purchasewifi doesnt work

8,2,unit does quickly charge device to  however once charged to full it turns off charging problem is it never turns charging back on unless devices is removed and placed back onthis is a problem when charging at bedtime only to wake up with device not fully charged cause it lost battery life while charging unit automatic turned off at  my phone percentage went from  to  percent in less than two hours with it on charging while listening to music  not happy with them at allfails to keep device charged
440,1,i asked the seller several times if the camera had the us letters at the bottom so i could register it in the us the seller confirmed that it did and that i could register it in jthe us when i open the camera the letters were ukca meaning you cannot register the camera in the us if you live in the us dont buy itif you in us dont buy this camera cannot be registered in the us
8577,2,had some issues at first was only getting  fps in  even after the firmware update messed with some settings in obs and got it working properly customer service is bad but they did offer a refund after the amazon return window decided to keep after geting it to work the colors in  are a little washed out but the picture quality is good enough for streaming in  get what you pay for
6979,1, ive used this camera literally twice since ive purchased it and it just stopped working for no reason it has a new battery and it never fell i am completely devastated because i already purchased a whole bunch of fujifilm sheets and accessories which are completely useless now very sad that i cannot even return itnot working
5699,2,i ordered this camera based on reviews i had read the camera i received printed terrible pictures when i contacted polaroid they had me reset the camera resetting did not help my prints were all blue and blown out just really terrible quality prints  they said there is something wrong with the heating element polaroid then said to send it back to the sender to get a new camera when i got my new camera the view blurry  when i look through the viewfinder everything is out of focus and there is no way to fix this the print is also still really bad i tried all the different color setting and the only one that printed correctly was the black and white setting i am very disappointed as i loved the old polaroids and was looking forward to using this new and updated camera i would not recommend buying this producti would not recommend buying this camera
8710,2,  cute design for kids no ink needed just buy the paper roll menu and buttons are annoying paper quality is similar to the one pos machine uses printed photos are pixelated even in the highest setting high price compare to the photo quality printedmy son was not impressed due to the quality of the printinghence  stars 
14752,5,i absolutely love this rice cooker and how easy it is to use the rice always turns out yummy and is cooked so quickly i highly recommend this to anyone who loves to make rice and wants a quality rice makeryummy rice
17343,5,the rice is cooked evenly all throughout the leftover lasts long even up to more than  days the markers on the side gives the perfect water level but let us make sure we use the rice measuring cup that goes with it the rice scooper is very durable external elegant look worth the priceperfect rice cooker
10459,5,"rice isnt inherently difficult to make but the variations of pans lids burner type and user error have made rice the bane of my existence for years i decided to purchase this a year or more ago and put it away thinking nah i can make rice why did i order this extra counter top item flash forward to me cleaning out my cabinets finding it again and deciding to use it just to see why i thought i needed itdirections are pretty straight forward use their cup for the rice rinse your rice rinse your rice rinse your rice yes three times add water to the fill line cover and start the cooker it turned off at about  minutes best rice ive made in my life not one crunchy piece in the pan rinsed with water and soap and done if you struggle making rice just buy this nowfinally nailed the easiest rice ever"
3798,1,since the moment i got this camera ive regretted it it is flimsy the strap already broke and the picture quality is lackluster i should have returned it when i got it but it was a present for my child unfortunately it is now a paperweight and ill need to get something better i dont recommend this camera to anyonejunk
6708,1,this is arguably the most mediocre and disappointing bag ive ever owned for quite a handful of reasonsthe camera compartment is only big enough for tiny cameras i dont need to carry a lot of gear but im also not an amateur or tourist for reference my carry around camera is a sony  and its almost too tall for this compartment even with a small lens it just feels like its too bulgy for this bag which is almost unbelievable like did i get the kids versionwith that the velcro and that compartment also royally sucks and falls apart constantly every time i open the bag the dividers are in a different place than i put them which leads the whole section being completely disorganized and items brushing against each otherone thing i kept reading is that this bag was really comfortable which is absolute garbage i mean maybe while its empty but if you have anything in it it is not made for all day wear i found this bag extremely uncomfortable after less than an hour of walking aroundand lastly the upper compartment is useless except for maybe carrying a hoodie it ends up bulging and hard to close if i have a medium sized book and try to bring a jacket with me even if jacket is tightly rolled upthe materials are fine the bag is well made minus the velcro i would only recommend this to an art student on a budget if they can find it used or a budding film hipster who only has one camera to carryim amazed that i havent seen other bad reviews about this it almost feels like every single review out there for these bags are paid for reviews im still not sure if i want to go to the hassle of returning it or just give it to goodwillthis may sound harsh but im being nice  this bag sucks
8912,1,camera wouldnt charge properly never got it to come on looked for customer support and found none sent an email to the seller and havent heard a word sending it backcamera didnt work and there is no support
10185,4,"manual indicates cups referenced in measuring uncooked rice use included measuring cup   us cupdoes this same reference include all cup measurements in recipes for fluids of any kind  and for other items in recipes other than fluids ie should use included cup for all items in recipeswould be helpful to indicate amounts in milliliterscup measurements very hard to see should use colored markingstype of rice crucial to determine ricewater ratio"
6501,2,its not a very good light for many reasons the battery life is short when i need to change it i cant use the light so i have to wait until its changed and its not very bright its better to get a similar light panel with external batteries so when one is done i can swap it and keep using itunusable when charging
9150,1,very poor picture quality i really doubt it has  megapixels ive used cameras set at  megapixel that performed better also very poor light reading basically a junk  megapixels  power zoom not
5743,1,the item does not seem to hold a charge it took days before it would even work i have yet to have it print a picture despite repeated efforts i reached out through the support system for the product and i have not yet received an answer after a few weeks i am giving this a one star because i feel like ive completely wasted my money the product never worked from the minute i opened the boxstill not working
9131,2,it says to store it in a the refrigerator but the pictures did not turn out week when i did even before i refrigerated it they were dullpictures are not clear

14492,5,absolutely love this rice cooker cooks rice thoroughly and not over cookedfast and well cooked
14042,5,"this mini rice cooker is an absolute gem it will look sharp in your kitchen most of all it does what youve hired it to do very well cook rice in the past ive had trouble with the bottom layer of rice being over cooked in rice cookers however thats not the case with the toshiba when the rice is finished cooking it goes right into the keep warmreheat mode ive had warm and fluffy rice every timeone thing i found strange is that the cooking timer starts out counting backwards in increments of five minutes first time it happened i thought there was something wrong with my rice cooker an odd way to do a cooking timer but you do get accustomed to itthe overall operations of this rice cooker are actually quite logical and straightforward thats good because the owners manual leaves a lot to be desired other reviews have mentioned the same thing the section on rice and water measurements is very insufficient and unclear if i were toshiba i would go back to the drawing board for the owners manualprice performance and functionality considering this is one little gem of a rice cookeran affordable and great performing little rice cooker"
13198,5,for cooking ricei like it
724,1,this camera took really poor quality photos i got better pictures on my iphoneeven from far away although it says image stabilization that wasnt our experience at all photos had poor quality color were grainy and blurry wish i hadnt bought itnot worth the money
1579,2,not even as good as my phone camera disappointed might be good for a kid before they get a phonenot so great
7867,2,every photo i print comes out with a yellowish tint even after adjusting the colors in the appcolors are off
3698,2,unlike  model i bought before brightness adjustment works welldiffuser magnets are offset against main body  off so they dont engagei am using a elastic cord to hold it typical bad chinese product sampleneewer  cover is simple and trouble free without  pici like the light but magnet difuser doesnt engage
7641,1,bought this for a gift and it wont work properly all images are either completely white or only a quarter of the picture prints out what a waste of hard earned dollarsdoes not work properly
8987,1,the product was packaged well and looked new the film was placed correctly with the yellow line showing batteries placed in correctly there was nothing covering the flash or any other part of the camera and the film door was not opened after film was placed for some reason only the first picture came out and the rest would come out black the film was not expired im not sure what was wrong with the camera but it was not worth the pricethis product was most likely defective
2980,1,all of the film is damaged and none of the pictures are showing up i bought them in bulk thinking id be saving money and i actually just wasted it all film damaged
14753,5,if you like to eat glutinous rice this is an investment you wont regret it doesnt have all the fancy buttons features but it just worksjust works
3838,1,i bought this for my daughter for christmas to use on vacations she used the camera  times and it will no longer charge so it no longer works definately not worth the money spent and is probably why return period was only for a monthdo not buy poor quality
7035,1,the air rocket broke literally on the first squeeze the plug in the back of it popped off the cleaning solution is water and the rest of the kit is cheap junk this kit is not worth the moneyjunk beware
3919,1,it was so so when it worked  the quality of the pictures its on the lower end so not so great but ok for a child to explore and make pictures instantly if not so expensive it will be ok the issue was that by the time i noticed its not working we were away  it expired the return window from amazon  amazon directed me to fuji and thats were the nightmare started the numbers that they provide on the website are not working  one is keep getting to the same automatic message regardless the option you chose  and the other one keeps disconnecting i tried emailing them and the emailed bounced back it took me few hours and few customers service staff from amazon to finally get to a supervisor that resolved the problem however moving forward i will look twice before ordering something from themlooks nice but not lasting long
1870,2,cool idea but photos are not real clear i knew they were tiny but not happy with picture qualitylittle little pictures
14385,4,the first time i tried to cook the rice i followed the directions and used their measuring cup to measure the rice and carefully added the correct amount of water as the gradations in the pot indicated the rice became very marshy and soft now i use a regular measuring cup and the the water  and am satisfied their measuring cup is slightly less than the standard one cup hbmeasure the rice and water  with a standard cup
7606,1,not plug and play lightingcheaper than expectedcant recommend
543,1,sorry but this cam no work the zoomone star
9803,4,i actually bought this for a friend whom i visit quite often his old aroma rice cooker bit the dust after literally several years it was a faithful little cooker he eats rice often so i looked for a new and realized this one was only a few dollars more for all the extra features plus it cooks cake how could you not want to try that to be completely honest the only things that have been cooked in it thus far has been rice cake and steamed veggies everything came out perfect except for the cake it wasnt bad by any means just wasnt pretty per se lol i cant speak to its other functions but man it is so easy to use i mean really it doesnt get any easier than mixing up cake batter throwing it in there pushing the cake button and letting it do its thing til it beeps how lazy can you get lol anyway this thing is fun ive had an instant pot and a ninja foodi this cooker is a little smaller but i like that it doesnt take up as much space and it could almost keep up with those cookers on less complicated or time consuming mealslove it
4389,1,this was a gift for my parents we uploaded pictures to the frame and after rotating through a few pictures the screen turned white same problem as a few other reviewers sending it backdidnt work right out of the box
8757,1,it looks great and im sure id love it if it worked the flash doesnt work at all despite trying several different troubleshooting tips from online manuals videos amazon and the polaroid manual wasted a full cartridge on troubleshooting but film is expensive and weve tried almost everything so we wont waste the second cartridge trying anything else the pictures above are just two of the messed up onesflash doesnt work
6411,1,first off i didnt expect much i wish zero stars were an option the gap between the sd slot and body is so wide that i actually slid my brand new sd card into the body of the camera after some failed attempts to fish the sd card out i decided the best thing to do was bash this pos and take a picture do not buy this product if that had of been a old sd card with memories on it i wouldve been devastated well played china two thumbs downtrash
7777,1,the box arrived all opened and used product inside and was very very dirty it is going right back sodisappointedthis is how the camera came in really bad situation
4208,1,i would not recommend this item to anyoneterrible picture quality
5490,2,pretty nice camera and overall im satisfied but i do have a gripe or two the major criticism i have thus far is that the writing on the buttons is already wearing off despite treating the camera gingerly ive had the camera less than  months and one button is illegible already very disappointed with that aspect also soon after my purchase the lens cap fell apart while attaching it one of the tiny springs shot out never to be found so the cap no longer stays on the lens ive never had similar problems with my nikon and canon productsedit   i have to lower my rating again at this point the sticker trim thats around the lens has begun pealing off ive not even used the camera in a few weeks took it out of its case and its hanging off cant be stuck back on readily i think panasonic really cut corners on the fit and finish of this camera although the image quality is very good at this point im starting to regret my purchase because im not confident the thing will hold together over timepretty nice camera and overall im satisfied  not so fast
3354,1,cheap camera  and boy you get what you pay for doesnt work and its a discontinued item worthless other than for a paper weightitem didnt work at all
4040,1,dealing with netgear has been one of the most exasperating technical support experiences of my life i have been through multiple support tickets and they refuse to stand behind their product i purchased the  camera arlo system with a  camera addon package in july of  for about  initially the system was very good  i was very pleased for about a year and a half i started getting an intermittent red tint on one of the cameras in february of  and opened a support ticket with them in april i went back  forth with tech support for several weeks  they give you a new set of instructions every time to chat or speak with them its almost like a game to see if they can get you to give up so after multiple attempts at removing and resynching cameras replacing batteries rebooting the system etc they say they will do a onetime replacement of the camera but during this process one of the other cameras wouldnt sync so i am down one camera i didnt want to go through the same process with the camera that now wont sync and i didnt want to send the camera with the red tint in because i would be down two cameras so i gave upin the fall of  i noticed that the batteries were burning at a much faster rate than they had previously in january of  the batteries in  cameras died in about  weeks so i made contact with tech support again in early february the tactics are the same  reboot delete and resync the cameras repeatedly replace the batteries etc the batteries were dead so they sent me three sets of batteries to try to get the issue resolved i installed the batteries deleted  resynced the cameras and none of them record video and all of the batteries were down to  in three days clearly there is a significant problem they then requested that i do a hard reset which i did i also removed  resynched the base station removed the cameras replaced the batteries in two of the cameras and attempted to resynch the cameras i was able to synch one camera but the other camera wouldnt resynch the lone camera that is synched is offline and will not connect  it doesnt record and cant be viewedso i now have a system that i paid almost  for and it is completely useless after  years i have not gotten a response from netgear after i sent my last two messages in the past  days i am extremely unhappy with how my issues have been handled and i will never buy another netgear product in my lifetime also any potential netgear buyers may want to check out the better business bureau page on netgear which gives you a good idea of how they handle customer complaints about their productsupdate   years later i would drop it to about  stars one camera now has a red tint and i went back and forth with tech support for several weeks about replacing it even though it was out of warranty and then another camera stopped working completely the cameras often become disconnected so video is not recorded and there is no way to remotely reboot each camera so i have to get the ladder out and hit the button on each camera to get it reconnected it seems to go through batteries faster than it did when i bought it as well  i am irritated that i have to dedicate so much time to a system that should be pretty easy to maintain plus i am down to  cameras instead of  because i dont want to go through  emails back  forth with the tech support folkslove this system  wish i could give it  stars my only criticism is the length of time that it takes to start recording  if the subject is fast moving you may miss part of the video in general it is great  easy to install easy to adjust and easy to viewsavesend the video viewed a doorbell ditcher on our doorstep at  and got good video  it was great to be able to see what was happeningupdate  buyer beware
9205,1,purely useless would post a video but camera doesnt work been screwed with no vaseline pos no pos
4456,1,after setting up and uploading my photos it wasnt easy it started working ok but a day later the screen is not working contacted pixstar and told them of my problem they have agreed to replace this is a piece of junk would not recommend am returning to amazonjunk
2205,2,the thing i liked about this item is how compact it is vs how large it expands the problem is the lights inside the box are only on the front and left sides so no matter how you set up your product for photographing you will have a shadow somewhere on it after fussing with it for several hours i decided to return it and just buy some really nice lighting for half the costlighting is horrible
8109,1,the photos are always very dark and blurry even in sunlight even with the flash everything will be gray and not saturated not recommended 
388,1,does not take very good pictures and is complicated to use my galaxy note  from  looks like it takes better pics than this you would be better off buying a samsung galaxy note  for  and using that as a camera only over this which was released in  its camera is far better and if you have a more modern phone from like iphone  or galaxy  and onward there is no need to ever think of buying thisa  smart phone takes better pics feels cheap and terrible quality
3064,1,bought  of these for myself for fathers day one is completely dead a month later good luck working through spypoint customer service ive tried to explain that the camera is dead  times hours on chat you are questioned about the brand of battery you are using the third unit i needed to use part of the box to keep the battery pack in placepaid for a club membership and unlimited photos and videos for a year for all  cams and you get treated like trash no thank youproduct subpar customer service is worse
8562,1,i am super bummed as we are currently out of the country with a new camera that will not turn on it was purchased as a christmas gift and should have checked it before we left literally never used once we charged it overnight and when we went to use it it would not turn on now we are on a trip without a camera i hope to contact the seller to see what we can do really disappointingwould never turn on
6419,1,i bought this months ahead of a snorkeling trip in hawaii first time out the water proof case worked for maybe  minutes then failed in  inches of water and filled with water i lost all the video and pictures of my wife swimming in a school of reef fish it seemed solid but next time ill go with a higher quality onewater proof case failed snorkeling
1838,1,the instant camera i got is not new seems like someone returned itthe camera looks like a returned piece
1419,2,instructions not clear no flash
1169,1,this is very cheap quality product pictures quality is not at all good description of the product does not match it is fraudworst product
5610,2,the camera doesnt work like it should after i charge it or the batteries and then try turning it on it wont and then it will and then it wont again even erased the pictures i had on there very disappointeda little disappointed
8452,1,bought the wrong thing  cant return it because it was after  days before our daughter opened itbought the wrong thing
2383,1,tried multiple cartridges of film nothing workedreceived a broken camera very unhappy
8340,1,will not focus on closeups very disappointed with minoltawill no focus on closeups
4867,1,i got shorted on film and i didnt get the cameradidnt get the camera
3132,1,these were mini sized does not fit in my camera at all total waste of money i took a chance with mixed reviews but ill just be going straight to walmart for themnot the right size
1779,2,im pretty sad i was super excited and happy to get this camera in today and i literally just opened this camera up an hour ago and looked up videos for instructions before using it however the red light will not go away i tried replacing the batteries went through an entire roll of film only  out of the  came out with a picture to see if i loaded it improperly however i didnt do anything incorrect to include not touching or smooshing the film the film is also brand new and was kept in the proper temperature setting there isnt a lot of information as to why the red light is still on in some articles it mentions that the camera might need to be cleaned or has a broken part but this is a brand new camera i dont get why i am having this issue right out of the box i was really excited to use this camera and its tainted my experience alreadynot happy 
1624,1,picture lighting and focus totally unsatisfactory battery life very sortquaity of photos
5312,1,i went on a trip with my friends and excited to take pictures i bought  more films but as i took a pic of friend  it printed all right then turned to friend  and bam it stopped working just like that it did not fall or hit something to break it changed the batteries even the film that was inside and still nothing till this day this carmera doesnt work no matter what i do tragicit has broken
1881,2,i only received three rolls of film not sixdidnt receive everything pictured
6035,1,this camera is very difficult to operate and the instructions are basically non existent the stands it comed with to attach to the helmet and bike were very difficult to assemble and the screws were too large so we had to buy a new set wouldnt recommendterrible quality
8916,2,i had high hopes for these cameras since minolta in my past experience has been a quality brand im very disappointed in these cameras we ordered  for our middle school twins who are taking a photography course right out of the box i noticed the construction wasnt very good quality and they felt cheaply made one of the two cameras flash doesnt work at allbought two one has a non functioning flash right out of the box
4744,1,my daughter got this camera for her birthday and loved it but it lasted a few months and the charging port broke on it she didnt drop it or anything and i went to go charge it and noticed it was an open hole and the piece some how got stuck inside to charge very disappointed if it wasnt for that issue i would say its great for kids not worth the money to only last a few monthsbroke disappointed
2454,1,this camera should not be sold on amazon literally have tried  times to troubleshoot and different ways to filmon this camera as possible every time we film it goes out of focus in  mins but its supposed to be an auto focus camera thats a lie also when using the camera for  minutes it starts to make your footage shake and you hear this noise in the audio like cords are being ruffled do not buy this camera selling this camera for over  dollars is an over kill because its no where near good at all very disappointed but glad i learned a lesson amazon should take this product down also its a scamdo not buy this camera its a scam
5927,1,absolutely wasted my money this camera is not ideal picture quality is trash the haptics on screen are delayed its not worth your moneynot worth it
16642,5,looked at a couple different rice cookers and decided on this one due to size pricing and other reviews so far i love it rice comes out perfect every time and makes it so much easier then remembering my pot in the stovelove it
5042,1,the camera stopped working after one usedo not buy
8781,2,poor image quality indoors evenings mornings even with the flash on images were blurry underexposed and carried a blueish hue tried multiple film packs to see if it was a fluke it was notmust be absolutely sunny and bright conditions
316,1,had to return could not get camera to focuscheck equipment before you buy
5813,1,camera will not power on in less that one month of use have tried multiple batteries have looked online for different ideas as apparently this is a common issue with canon products i have not been able to figure out a solution so i sent the camera in to the canon factory usa repair center this camera allegedly had a one year warranty and i sent it in within  days of my purchase canon replied with a message that they dont perform repairs on this model of camera they said they would simply replace the camerabut only if i paid them  that is completely unacceptable service for a company that claims to offer a warranty avoid this model avoid canon altogethercamera died within one month
8819,1,cool concept  camera but this model specifically does not take good photos honestly wasted moneyeh
2376,1,i took less than  photos one cartridge of film and the camera stopped working although i can turn the camera on the button is inoperabledo not purchase this instax model it is not worth the moneystopped working after less than  photos
7214,1,hard for me to take picturedifficult camera angle
17340,5,"i love rice this makes the best rice there is no competition ive never had rice this good not even in restaurantsmaterials solid cleans up easy definitely quality you can feel itcooking takes longer than cheap rice cookies regular white took an hour or so but worth the wait plays some music when its done my son hears it and comes running in because he knows the rice is readyleftovers tupperware work lunches reheated in microwave still tastes amazing huge difference between rice cooked in cheaper rice cookerskeep warm used extended keep warm for almost  hours press the regular keep warm to bring it back to proper temperature still tastes great the next daybottom line i didnt buy this for over  years because i couldnt justify the price tag for a rice cooker i was wrong if you love rice buy this as soon as possiblenow go buy some expensive rice to go with this like tamaki gold one word amazing"
3356,1,camera will not turn on at all fully charged the battery and when you attempt to turn it on a red light comes on and will not turn offdont waste your money
15780,5,"i couldnt be any more pleased with this small rice cooker from moosumive always struggled making rice because ive had to babysit it and i either add too much water or not enough meaning sticky rice or hard ricethis little device takes the hassle out of the equation and makes up to  cups of cooked rice to perfection all at a fair price for one of theseperfect for meal prep "
7901,2,pics do not turn out as expected they are much darker than they appear on the phone and thus not worth the cost of paper to print very poor quality photos but fast and easy to use the printer would not buy it againdark pics
10664,5,this rice cooker has a small footprint which i like since i dont have a whole lot of counter space  works for a family of  for one meal rice cooks perfectly and does not stickgreat little rice cooker
6220,2,the biggest problem with this cover is that its very stiff so the camera has trouble auto focusing with it on small lenses it just pops off the end fits my  fine but dont bother trying to zoom in or out its incredibly difficult to adjust the zoom and the bag will pop off if you zoom out too fartoo rigid to be worth using
3895,1,the first time i used this it was great  time i came home to transfer all of my photos and every single id of them were no where to be found on the camera just tried it again last night and took lots of cute pictures and made sure i didnt accidentally hit anything so they didnt get deleted i came home this morning and every single one of them are gone  deleted paid  for pictures that last  seconds no thanksdeletes pictures
4604,1,bought for my grandson for christmas and it doesnt workdont buy
14142,5,perfect for  peopleworks welli cooked rice and quinoa and it was perfectthe price is also very reasonablelittle but great
10651,5,this rice cooker does a good job for being so smallrice cooker
14438,4,"i am too used to the zoji brand that went dead after  years bought toshiba to try since it has quick rice function that can cook  cups the function is simple and easy to use except the display is quite hard to look through the yellow or amber tinted coverit is quite consistent with the keep warm feature and i can hear the power cut tick noise assure the rice is kept warm the time display makes it better to find out how long it will take to finish the processworth more than the price"
11225,1,years of using basic walmart rice cookers for under  i decided to get this one mostly due to the pink color and ceramic material first off it isnt ceramic but it worked great the moment i used it so no issues there i kept using this pretty often mostly making small batches as recommend and even started experimenting by adding in lemon and parsley inside after threefour months of use it suddenly stopped working and its difficult to get any assistance on this item from amazon or the manufacturer hard pass get a japanese higher end rice cooker imoworked great for three months then nothing would cook
1309,1,when i turned the camera on it just sat on the ishare screen it wont let me turn on or off the camera ive pressed every button on the camera and it just sits on this screen such a waste of money dont buywont turn on
2819,1,we bought this for our daughter so she could take pictures of her sisters graduation when we returned home and checked it a few weeks later the pictures were gonepictures are gone
7618,1,didnt match the description or sizedescription listed is not correct
6331,1,such a shame my little boy was so excited to get this as a christmas presenthe took two photos with it and the battery died we tried charging it multiple times but it would only stay powered up with the lead in very disappointed 
11085,5,cooking rice for me and my  dogsdoes a good job on rice
15481,4,"i am pretty basic with my rice needs i cook long grain white rice and jasmine rice a few times per week i have been using a name brand rice cooker but it has gotten to the point that it makes a terrible mess every time i use it i tried this one because i like the smaller sizemy first impression is that it is very lightweight almost cheap feeling the electrical cord is detachable the pot does have a nonstick coating that has been doing a great job this rice cooker does heat up much faster than my name brand one did and so far has not left a mess for me to clean upthe reason for my  star deductions is for the lack of simple features there is no steam basket so this is rice only there is no timer you simply push down the single button and it pops up like a toaster when the rice is done the rice spatula is a joke it broke on the first use luckily i have othersfor just a few dollars more you can get a much nicer rice cooker if  is your budget this one will be great if you can make your budget  there are a lot better rice cookers out therecooks rice well with minimal features"
5284,1,sent me the camera but without the lens i had to return the product hope all goes well just spend the extra  and but it from nikon directly and save yourself the headache this product is too good to be true and it is dont bothersent me the camera but without the lens 
13238,1,this rice cooker is an example of things that people would never buy if you could actually see it first the inside pot is poorly crafted with cheap metal alloy non stick coated which will scratch at the slightest dont wash with anything abrasive the warmer setting dries out if not overcook the rice so its better to just turn it off by unplugging it which also means you need to be there to unplug or youll get poorly made rice cheap and not worth itcheap poorly made
4703,1,i have been unable to use i have a otter box on my phone and it will not not fitinto phone very disappointing plus it got to me a month latedont use if you have an otter box case
8172,1,what i thought would suit my purpose because it has extreme battery life doesnt make up for its shortcomings rarely do i come down on something however dont spend your money its compact it seems to have everything going for it but it loves to eat the sd card and you cant get it out this is my second one i asked them to return the sd card out of my other cam they never did it sits in a box and a lesson well learned next month ill purchase a goproi dont think you really want to do this
1131,1,at this price it would be fine if it werent for the fact that they lie about the specs the camera does not perform at  using the  resolution anything above standard hd gets significantly low framerate might be good for a kid but be advised the body is really cheap plastic i imagine the inside electronics are not very well put together based on my product experiencefalse advertising on  camera
300,1,missing memory cardmissing memory card
5516,1,battery problems im giving this only  for now because i havent been able to use it much when i use it more ill edit this to a review of the actual camerai unpacked the  and plugged it in to charge as directed a couple days later went to the zoo very short visit a park took some nice flower pictures and an event last sunday im sure i plugged it in either before or after the park and i was surprised that the battery was low after taking only a couple pictures on sunday at the event i plugged it in when i got home and when i got to the zoo yesterday no powerthe camera does not come with an external charger first ive ever had that doesnt and to charge it you plug it in i was using the cable that came with the camera and there was a red light when i plugged it in each time but the battery never chargedmonday i ordered an external charger   extra battery packs and now have one of them in the camera and can finally actually use itproblems charging the battery while in the camera
8581,2,this is a  camera on amazonit works the same as a  camera on amazonthe picture quality is very lowand the light doesnt work as advertisedthis will be a returnwaste of time
4659,1,when the ad first shows up it states that it works with samsung galaxy  i ordered it and it doesnt work with that phone now that i look closer into it it doesnt have that phone listed wasted my moneycpompatable
13590,5,bubbles over if you dont rinse well but not a huge mess a little paper towel and one more surface to clean after dont let this stop you from getting the classicperfect rice
6051,1,got a defective camera it was supposed to be for my son to take pictures at our trip to disney land but due to the issue we had to returneddisappointed
2481,1,stopped working after only a few months of limited use camera just dieddied after a few months limited use
7369,1,the product did not live up to my expectations it was not easy to trace the item i wanted i would not recommend it to anyoneneolucida xl
4264,1,first impressions the bag looks good a little on the small end i use a sony  with attached sigma  which is a fairly large lens but its exactly what i needed since it fit like a glove and is compact also held my  additional lenses and accessories fit just fine along with an attached small tripod to the loop on the sidehowever after just  weeks of normal use i never even got to take it on a real shoot of taking the camera bag to and from work and hanging it on coat hooks etc the handle ripped once it ripped i could not help but pull on the cord and it immediately unraveled hence why the handle looks frizzy in the picture the handle showed no signs of noticeable wear when i received itheres what upset me more than the bag ripping the bag was just hung on a hook at eye level i watched it when it ripped and crashed on the tile floor with my expensive camera and lenses and because this bag is on the lighter end it has close to no padding on the base the side of the camera sits on the base of the bag it banged so loud on the floor that you would think it was the sole camera with no protection hitting the floor i rushed to check on my gear and the camera seemed ok for now however i dont know if my lenses or sensors where damagedmisaligned in the fall you try holding your camera at eye level and see if you would be ok with a straight drop unsettlingin conclusion the bag looks nice has good reviews its compactbut i cant recommend it whatsoever as you risk breaking your expensive gear due to bag failure this is not something that should not be a concern while your shooting or storing gearpoor quality liability for your gear
8802,1,pictures come out so dark i turned on all the lights in the room with the flash and still very darknot happybad pictures
17309,5,weighs a ton takes up a lot of counterspace in box accessories are perfect works like a dream especially if you are used to their pressure cookers good directions expensive but worth  instapot product replacing other stuff as they die
6134,1,awful bugs out all the time dissapointedone star
1427,1,this is a very poor camera the directions are very lacking can get the menu up cannot change setting from off to on on the date label of change lines from cancel to ok on the delete linewould not recommend this cameravery lacking on directions
7710,2,easy to use but stopped working after  months the screen would freeze and he camera would not turn off the camera would need to run out of battery in order to try using it again would not recommendeasy to use but stopped working after  months
4592,2,camera pack is really nice unfortunately i am not able to take pictures there is so type of defectpictures
8600,1,as a content creator and part time streamer i found that this camera was a complete slap in the face with the false advertisement of  the color was terrible the white balance had a mind of its own whenever a program using the webcam was closed and reopen the tripod that came with the webcam was super light so it caused the camera to tilt over if any sudden movements were madeterrible just god awful product
2591,1,i loved this product for my  yr old daughters birthday she can use it just fine and i was super excited until yesterday i turned it on and its not working anymore we just bought this in sept and i keep it out of reach while its not being used and shes probably used it a handful of timesdisappointing hopefully seller has good customer service will respond with the action takin by cs as well as the response from cs hopefully i will be able to change my review star statusbroke in  months
5844,1,it takes two photos most of the time since i take  to  photos at my home inspections it almost doubles the number which increases the many hours i spend reviewing the photos before compiling my reportit takes two photos most of the time
5429,1,hi seller how do i do an item return i believe the camera is faulty these are pictures taken right out of the box 
2206,2,the unit arrived in  weeks late after being lost in shipping i do not know if it was the seller or shippers fault exactlyone i received the unit and started using it for multiple objects to test i hated it the lights are only on the left side and in the front leaving the back and right uneven requiring additional lighting this box is not transparent which makes it hard to use an existing light in my setupi shoot product photography and thought this would be a good portable unit
5454,2,this camera is okay but the picture quality was not so good the picture quality on this camera was not even better than my old fuji camera that i bought about  ago or more had to return this camera because i still have my fuji camera and it doesnt make sense to pay for this camera that will just end up in the closet soon enoughpicture quality is not that good
2956,1,i got this big pack to last me for a little while half way through the first foil package the film strips started doing this instead of developing and theres no way to know its like this until about ten minutes after you take the photo im so disappointed and consider the expensive product unusablefilm defective
5405,1,stopped working after little use within  months turns on while charging but does not turn on after charging unfortunately i use if for work and will need to find another very small buttons to pushstopped working after little use within  months
2103,1,i purchased this as gift and the camera didnt work when my friend tried to use it was outside of return window so i was stuck a broken camera and quite embarrassedit didnt work
7295,1,i bought the camera to replace my old gopro after it was damaged while scuba diving in i purchased at six weeks ago and now im getting ready to go on another trip i open the box to find there is no battery in the camera and no battery anywhere in the box now that its six weeks since the sale i have no recourse to return itno battery
7405,1,i got this camera today and tried to take a picture of my dog in her bed just to try it out in my welllit apartment flash went off and the picture is still so dark shes barely discernible tried multiple rooms where the light fluctuated and nothing helped tried selfie mode didnt help wasted a whole roll of instax film and checked that the instax film is not expired this camera is either defective or a total waste of moneydefective or extremely poor quality
2465,1,dont even waste a little of your time this is not a good camera just get you a ring light for your phone until you can get the real thing smhdont waste your time
11222,5,this is the little rice cooker who could its perfect for me keep in mind it is a tiny rice cooker it wont feed a family of  but it works great for me and a guest with a little left overawesome sauce
4863,1,used three packs of film now and the first picture of each roll works then the rest of the roll turn out blackblankdisappointing flaw
2557,1,my whole family loved this camera after my daughter received it for her birthday its such a great idea however like many other comments have stated after charging it wont turn on againdisappointing
4185,2,i scrolled for a long time trying to pick the correct package for my grandson i was shorted  packages of film chose the package that advertised  film packaged only received  the package with only two films was  cheaper super disappointed and ripped offpicture shown not what sent
7999,1,easy to use once you figure out but print quality is poor waste of money 
17489,5,you want great rice you want great rice consistently buy this dont even bother considering other models just buy this model right now rice may be easy to make can be done easily in a pot but there is nothing like this maker for its variety and simplicityeasiest rice cooker ever
10044,5,works well and great priceworks well
10635,5,this is so cute it makes  of the best tasting rice i have made in just a few minutes and it takes up no roomthe best and little
168,1,i dont know any of the features due to the fact the camera wouldnt format sd card i called canon no one knew how to fix problem they wanted me to send it in no ill return this crap and buy a nikonjunk
2381,1,the flash is always on and it will ruin  of what youre trying to capture this was an expensive mistakethis is crap
7118,1,returned this item because it looks different the material is very flimsy like a plastic folderehh
2996,1,the film is ruinedim doing everything right but the film is proper messeddissatisfied because im a student who cant afford film to start with and the ones i did receive arent printing properly 
3754,2,bought this for my daughter for her birthday in late nov she was thrilled to use it during her vacation but wasnt able to bc the camera never had a photo card unable to purchase this card anywhere weve looked it has been a unused gift so to give a fair review on quality of photo value for the money etc is impossible but dissatisfied that her bday gift is left unused and impossible to find a photo card that fits waste of money spentno photo card with camera and cant buy elsewhere so unusable
8720,1,i received a pen as a gift and was very disappointed with the quality the video is very blurryexpected more
2889,1,headline says it all i am returning it for a refund and will avoid this selleroverpriced camera that doesnt work
3445,2,it worked for one night and then will not charge or turn ondoesnt work for long
14101,5,so far so goodworks as expected
7229,2,the material was a very plastic fake leather that just felt very uncomfortable on the skin the tripod mount screw was too long for the mount on the bottom of my battery grip the whole think looked and felt much cheaper than the photos i still suspect for some people this could work and the concept is good but i expected morejust didnt work for me
5717,2,the box has no manufacturer date or expiration date this is a very big problem because polaroid film only has a shelf life of  monthsno manufacturer date
4544,1,well after pointing out that my  is faulty to the technical staff over at  after lengthy technical staff emails back and fourth with videos they have gone silent on methe videos i have shared with them are definitive proof of one lens side being faulty long story short as the camera runs for some time gradually the outer lens video gets grainierdustylike more and more to the point it looks like its smothered in dustdigital artifacting this does not occur on the inner lens the same test was done rotating the camera around  degrees same issue same lens side doesnt matter what settings the camera is set with ive tried it all same result with all latest firmware ectnever been in water used  times never droppednever overheatedect still have the screen shipping plastic film on it this is most apparent in low lighting settings but extremely apparent as you can see from the pictures i posted here the first snapshot is from the begging of videoand the second  minutes instationary with no changes in lighting or position terrible noiseartifacts as you can see the other inner lens does not so this the third picture is also the outer lens on single lens mode showing a purple hue haze along the bottom it doesnt matter where the camera is pointedsame issue again the inner lens does not do this in the same conditionstech support just gives me the run around saying its settings issues in low light bla bla bla no it is notnot impressed love the camera but whoahis this the support lack of one getsreturning to amazon as they have not stepped up to offer exchange and i cannot lose my return policy window with amazon 
7904,1,i bought this product because i dedicated more than  years to professional photography including photo lab color and blackwhitei bought this with  photo paper for this printer for my daughter photo booth so we can print the pictures of her sweet  at home we tested with the paper that came with the printer all pictures were displaced basically only  of the picture is on the frame the rest is whiteadde new set of paper and the in every case error of jammed papercontacted kodak  days ago by email to support no answer yetdont buy this product
8876,1,update  feb  a  ago i had sent my amazon purchased minolta proshot  because it wasnt focusing properly and kept resetting itself i sent it as instructed and was sent another in its place i finally gained opportunity to use and this replacement is much worse then my initial oneit too keeps resetting itself claiming something is wrong with the lens defect and had to reset the camera by turning it off plus the internal mirror is filthy because ive got spots on my images cleaned the lens itself and its clean and it also doesnt function as quickly even with a fast processing photo sd cardmy semifunctioning canon continous and images works better than this as well take better imagesi am still under warranty now i will give minolta under elitebrandscom another chance but after that i am demanding a full refundthis is riduclousreceived camera sooner than scheduled date im grateful thanks upon opening everything is wrapped and presented as new a plus however the socall camera bag could be better quality not expensive just dont have the feel so mediocre also having a battery charger rather than having to charge by camera would have been a plususe of the camera i wish there were more detail usage in manipulating the different functions on youtube only showed the finished photos sure thats nice how to get those finished type images would be another plus dont get me wrong i dont mind trial and error but a few demonstrated shortcuts are nicethe instructions are a bit vague and at times frustrating especially when comes to saving settings again like all cameras one must get to know and feel comfortable with anything new with constant usage took me almost a few months or so to become accustomed to my canon powershoton the positive side the shape and feel resembles handling my canon powershot viewfinder and rotating lcd appreciate the zoom capacity and that i am able to use one film camera filter lens over the primary lensoverall nice camera birthday present to self  as of  feb  thats an understatementupdate malfunctioned after a few months  a few lacking now a bad camera
2299,1,returned camera not working properly 
9068,1,an entire pack of  with blurry washed out images and i have  plus years as a photographer i support this project but the images are barely usabledisappointed
17457,5,trial and error with a bit extra water on the softer setting at  ft does good rice the instructions say dont use it at high altitudes i canworks at  feet using softer setting
366,1,got this camera for my daughter and i left it on the charger for three days it still says its not fully charged and wont even turn on unless its connected to the charger i know its a cheap camera but not worth the money i will be returningwont charge
6602,1,great camera but i am so pissed that i cant upload photos from the camera to my iphone as promised the description of the product the manual and the amazon answers for this camera all assured me that i would be able to wirelessly move photos from the camera to my iphone using the snapbridge app i searched for snapbridge in the app store and got nothing so i went to snapbridgenikoncom where it says that the snapbridge app will not be available for ios devices until august  one of the reasons i purchased this camera was far an upcoming trip on which i do not plan to bring my laptop i wanted to be able to share the nikon photos via my iphone onto social media during said trip guess thats not happening now and ill have to wait until i get home to offload them the oldfashioned waycannot wirelessly sync with iphone afterall
16597,4,"this is an all digital rice cooker when turn on all the cooking options show up on the screen you have to use the arrow button to get to the option white rice brown rice etcthe exterior is simple and cleancut with a flat top i got the  cooker so it does not take a lot of space on the counter the interior is designed for easy cleaning the top inner lid can be removed and put back easily with a snapone little negative point i paid a slightly higher price for a model  that is supposed to be made in korea per the product description i got one model  that is made in china i am sure both perform the same however i felt i was misled and paid extra for the same model that was sold for a few dollars lesscook rice fast"
5115,1,i ordered this camera after watching multiple tiktoks about it and once i purchased it and it came in i quickly realized that not only was it over hyped but also that this camera is not good at all after playing with the settings to get the best quality the quality was still horrible and not only that but audio was terrible even with an additional mic dont waste your money on this itemdont waste your money
4999,2,it was a gift from my niece for  years however the gift quickly broke she said that she managed to take only three photos the camera has a red light all the time and the camera doesnt work the photos turned out to be very unclear i dont recommend it its a waste of moneybad quality
1773,2,pictures come out super white and light even in different lightings and the camera will not take pictures  of the time i have to keep turning it on and off and hope it will worknot the best purchase
8140,1,play video i purchased the ghostxl on may   since day one the audio recording was not right when i could not find a solution after several days i reached out to drift via amazon they fairly quickly seemed to get confused and forwarded me to drift directly for better supportthe camera never recorded audio correctly via the external microphone using the same microphone and required drift adapter resulted in two very different experiences if manually starting the recording power on the unit with a long press then press a second time to start recording the audio was great if you turn on the one button recording feature quick press the on button and the recording instantly starts the audio is very distortedseveral email and video exchanges with drift resulted in going thru hoops to try and get the issue across to them in the end they wanted me to try a drift microphone and make another sale of their own branded products but i failed to see the logic in their request they were either truly not getting it stalling and hoping i would go away at one point i was asked and i complied to roll back the firmware on my camera they also seemed to get confused a few times during out emailspros great battery life very good image quality versatile mounting options very good build qualitycons proprietary external microphone jack cable external microphone sound quality issues in auto one button record little to no customer supporti returned the camera  one day before the return deadline with amazon prime thank you amazon for your support in making this right although i cant be  sure i feel drift would have dragged their feet well beyond any return window and i have no confidence they would have provided a resolution as they were quick to offer groundless suggestions almost as it they were not reading my emails or did not understand the issuei am showing the emails below for those why may be curious as to what they may expect when reaching out to drift for support i loved my ghostx older camera and wanted to love this one but the customer service experience was a total let down the product is great a when it works but the support behind i felt was lackingi have attached a short video of the audio issue i sent these same videos to driftc support in the end i do not want to be stuck with a camera that does not work as promised and with no resolution in sight should driftc reach out to me i will gladly update my review and rating but only if they step up and do whats right i am not the only person with this issue a quick search for this model and audio issues will easily show what others have been dealing with my situation is not unique if they reach out via email to me and can provide me a logical reason how the microphone can cause this then i will update this as wellsuch a shame i liked the camera otherwise i love my older driftx and had high hopes for this camera maybe they will correct this issue in a future releasecheerssequence of emails looking for  to drift innovation ltd   i just purchased a new ghost xl serial  with firmware  the microphone distorts badly when using the instant record feature when i manually turn on the

one touch record feature the audio is very distorted if i start the camera then manually start recording the issue is not present this occurs regardless of what mic i use the fact i am using the same mic and mic adapter supplied with the unit tells me this must be a firmware setting or some other camera issue i have also tried adjusting the mic sensitivity down to  with the same resultscan you assist and let me know if there is a resolution for this known issue and if the  firmware my camera came with is newer than the  that is currently listed on the website i fear all i will get from

advise on next steps regarding my case i opened a ticket may   approx  days ago my last correspondence from driftc was may   approximately  days ago as of todays date  i am happy to try a different update if you recall i was asked to and successfully downgraded my firmware from  to  please advise asap as the camera is not functioning as intended and is not usable as is in my situationregardsdrift responded after i returned the  support drift  jun   bsthi raythanks for your patience here and i do apologise for the delays at this very busy timehaving analysed your clips with our team we can see that you are experiencing some kind of interference with the audio in your recordingshowever i do note that you mentioned using a thirdparty mic accessory and although i appreciate that you havent had any issues with this particular mic previously  as our cameras are nor designed to be compatible with thirdparty manufactured accessories unless stated otherwise  see universal mount adapter etc and so if you could try using a drift external mic accessory linked below we can hopefully try and work out why this is happening and get you some answers going forwardlet me know how you get on here ray and i look forward to your replykind regardstech supportdrift innovationweb  jun  you please explain this logic in buying a drift microphone for further testing i sent two clips clearly showing the audio distortion in both clips i am using the same external microphone with the same adapter that came with the camera the only difference is the way i start up the recording there are no issues whatsoever with manually starting the recording with the  party microphone but there are issues when i use the one button automatic recording feature kindly explain what the microphone has to do with this when the only aspect that changes is the way i start the recordingas an engineer this may point to a sign that the firmware or camera circuitry is looking at some other aspect differently for the microphone when starting in different modes this was also a reason why i questioned being asked to downgrade my firmware as instructed by support newer firmware typically resolves these types of issuesregardsaudio issues  nonresponsive slow customer service
5225,1,did not work made my kid so angry because he was so excited it didnt workgarbage
5419,2,got this for my kid as it seemed value for money and a decent camera seems promising and she was excitedhowever the camera was not what i had expected it is slim but its so slim tt if you have bigger hands you might find it difficult to handlealso i was unable to charge it with the provided cable no light lit and didnt seem to work after a few hours of chargingcamera also got stuck with the lens out of the casing and could not retract could be it ran ouy of battery but it did not charge w the ptovided cable a couple of times it managed to retract but w much difficulty and finally it decided not to retractmaking a return is troublesome as you have to send it back to the us and not to amazon sg but i still did as no point holding onto a stuck cameraotherwise if it did work it would be a good hobby camera for a kid given the price point and specs 
611,1,i didnt know the picture could look so badworse picture quality
14045,5,so far it has made perfect rice every time the cheap one we had was ok but no comparison to this one white rice cooking function takes about  minutes to cook so plan aheadgreat little rice cooker worth the price
7045,1,some items in the kit are good and others are dollar store quality i had hoped for more 
230,2,love the idea of the camera and just got it i wanted to have it send photos directly from the cameras built in wifi to my iphone  pro which has an ios of  no luck after searching the internet it seems panasonic only supports this feature up to ios  with no plans to change thatyou can however make the transfer through the internet wifi like if you are home but not directly from the camera not great since i bought it to take on safariif you dont need the remote transfer feature its probably great i havent used it enough to knowconnection to modern iphones doesnt work
14746,5,its very easy and fast in cookingvery good rice cooker
8463,2,i purchased this in hopes of having some fun with film again after years of working with digital and recording some hardcopy memories with a little you know retro twist yes im making myself cringe a bit shhwhat ive found unfortunately is that while the camera itself mostly functions as well as one might expect a polaroid film camera to do including the viewfinder set to the side the film loading process the challenge of lining up the shot of your first go the simple pointandshoot process and bbzztslidetheres your picture the issue i think is that the camera is trying to also work as a digital camera and it sort of cantfirstly having the more traditional viewfinder set to the side and not connected to the lense in the way digital cameras are leaves you with a bit of a problem when you offer digital camera style modes  it leaves everything is up in the air and not in a fun wayam i too close is this person going to be a blur who knows they look okay in the viewfinderam i close enough to use the macro mode am i too close should i wait until i see the whites of their eyesthe manual says  cm away from the object but unless you bring a ruler around with you everywhere have an exceptionally good eye for measuring or have figured out the perfect distance more by trial and error  youre about to get a load of blurry blobs of color for the one shot you could have gotten if the viewfinder worked with the lensesecondly i have no idea what is going on with these different modes but ive had the unfortunate displeasure of finding out that many of them fail at doing what it was specifically designed to do party mode nope all black background when it was a rather welllit area behind us kids running around mode nope theyre a blur even if you track their movement the only one that really worked was the doubleexposure mode which is cool but not exactly the most versatile to sum it up nearly every single image we have taken was blurry out of focus andor underexposed shots that were taken multiple times from varying distances with additional light produced the same disappointing resultsperhaps i received a lemon maybe everyone who used it has shaky hands maybe were all just terrible at this suddenly either way im sending mine back feeling pretty bummedmishmashing digital and film doesnt always work
4505,1,i was so excited for this new instax and with the price tag you think it will be all singing all bells but actually its just ok the reason i am giving it  star is because it jammed half way and destroyed a full reel off instax which amazon refused to refund even though the camera damaged it its a bit weird to use i have  instax minis of varying models and this one definitely has the most weird buttons and not a great description book when you finally get the back open it will automatically try and print a picture and due to it being jammed it just kept ruining photos  
5930,1,came with a random hot pink polaroid case that doesnt even fit this camera did not come with the gray case pictured which is the main reason i purchased the bundlebirthday gift

9058,2,i traveled to europe for a vacation with this film all of my photos came out horribly blotted or not at all considering this film is so expensive i reached out to polaroid to see what they can do they told me that the film was damaged by going through the xray machine at tsa i kept them in a checked baggage what a waste of money really disappointeddo not travel with it
629,2,our  year old son asked for this for his birthday so he could take pictures like we do like cell phone photos not masterpieces when we go on vacation or hikes etc he has used our phonescameras before and takes lovely pictures he unwrapped it and got it out immediately and was so excited and started taking photos and they are horrible blurry poorly lit despite little light that turns on on the front of the camera and not a single shot fit for print he was so disappointed and felt awful asking us if we could return it and get a different onepros small compact relatively easy to figure out how to usecons terrible photosterrible photo quality

9103,1,i ordered my film back in february i just opened it not too long ago and both of my films i ordered came broken on one partbroken film
1808,1,play video i bought this for myself i was very excited to get it i received it and it worked great and then about a week later the button that you push to take the photos in and now i cant take photos try to get some help with a replacement but nobody would help me places that dont stand behind their products dont waste your money because they know whats wrong and they continue to sell their products instead of replacing the products that they sell that are faultylove the polaroid option stuck button the length in light of the camera

2580,2,the actual films or whatever theyre called came in broken two of them were broken but we couldnt get a replacement without returning the whole item thats unfortunate because we could only take a few picsbroken
3721,1,delivered with a defective battery or battery chargerworks with an ac adapter only which doesnt come with the lightdoesnt turn on defective
2382,1,it only worked for  months and then stopped working i asked about a refund or replacement but have not gotten a reply so disappointedstopped working after  months
1369,1,first off i was very excited to play with this camera but i dont like the false advertising that it works with all deviceswhen you take a video it gets stored on the sd card when the time comes to view or edit your videos you have two  use wifi to connect to the camera this works but its a nightmare to play or edit videos this way as its very slow and  use wired connection to your iphone or ipad this is the fastest way to work with your videos except if you have an apple device this wired connection is not supported even though their website says it is check the support message belownow why would you sell me a camera  transfer cable specifically made for ios when you dont even support it why are you selling the cable evenbottom line if youre an apple device user viewing videos and editing them anywhere other than your computer is out of the questionthis camera doesnt work with ios
319,2,i once had an  that was very good and thought this would be somewhat comparable but it is not the auto exposure created muddy underexposed stills so i now use it in manual mode entirely  throughout the zoom range is a plus ill be getting a used canon  ii for this unit to backup in the fieldpoor video
2965,2,the used like new option is poor quality these must have been stored improperly or damaged with time the photos turn out blotchy and darkdont buy usedlike new
12031,4,this replaced my  year old rice cooker by the same manufacturer nothing was wrong with my old one it was just bulky and i wanted something a bit more streamlined so far i like how its performedupgrade
1609,1,so excited for this camera i know its cheap so wasnt expecting it to have the best quality but unfortunately after  months  of course return window is closed it doesnt work screen is all blurry very upset do not  months and it doesnt work
15792,5,this rice cooker works great rice comes out perfect each time it was very easy to set up and it is very easy to clean i was nervous when it said  cup of each since im used to doing  cups of water per  cup of rice but the rice came out perfectly perfect for smaller families needing to cook rice on the side my toddler loves rice so we cook it just about everyday and this shortens the time and it makes it easier for usgreat rice cooker

1718,1,we bought this camera for our daughter for christmas she wanted a blogging camera to make videos for youtube read the instruction manual then once we were ready to record a video once on the recording mode it would not stop recording and the camera wouldnt change to any other mode or anything just kept recording a video would not even turn off tried removing the battery and the battery would not even come out finally it decides to shut off we turn it back on to try again and it wouldnt take a photo or video and kept saying now that there is no sd card whenever there is an sd card and it is the one it came with we are going to try to purchase a new card to see if this one is defective but my guess is this camera is just crap i never review products but i felt this needed to be put out there seeing how it has so many good reviews which is why i bought it and it was our daughters main gift that she wanted more than anything and its total crapdo not buy
4590,1,camera does not print picscamera not working
4434,1,nothing worked right wont play videos says theyre too big every time it goes to sleep it wont wake up we have to go back to the menue and start all over the frames we had before were great now theyve added wifi and nothing worksdoesnt work

6073,1,would never use this stuff every thing i use falls apart instantly everything is lose and not secured well at all dont waste your money it cost me a action camera so sad cant afford to buy another one helmet attachment broke while riding lost action carera cheap parts cost me a  action camera

2341,1,broken right away like she played the video games a few times then tried to take a picture and it froze and never lit up againbroke quickly
8915,1,i love how the camera feels in my hand but i have been charging the battery now for  hours and the camera will not yet turn on so i did i buy a new camera with a battery that wont take a charge what happens next do i need to return the entire packagegetting to try the camera out
5582,1,so i want to start out by saying that when it does print it prints cute vintage photos however it only gets one star because it sucks with batteries every time ive used it twice now ive had to change the batteriesit sucks batteries
10455,5,"i originally bought this for making smaller amounts of rice then after looking at the included recipe booklet i saw it could make other grainsdecided to try steel cut oats which i normally dont make because i dont want to stand over a pot mixed the oats and water and pressed the on button and went back to my officenext thing i know perfect steel cut oats unplugged the cooker added a little cinnamon almond milk and dried apple bits and let it set for a few minutes and i had three mornings worth of oats i could just reheathighly recommend this cooker for smaller householdsgreat versitility for grains"
284,1,i ordered a brand new camera and received unpacked used camera terrible experienceto receive what i ordered
4916,2,impossible to upload photos onto phonespend more money for a better camera
14257,5,i love this rice cooker it makes perfect sticky rice and brown riceperfect rice every time
7640,1,the camera originally arrived a day later than it was supposed to and when it did i only got the camera and the case none of the film i went out and bought my own film to try with it wont work it wouldnt even eject the film protector i ended up getting the film but after emailing them about the camera then calling them they still havent done anything when i called the guy had no idea what he was talking a out and then went completely silent a waste of  do not buymissing parts broken camera no customer support
7881,2,app is easy to install  set up need to sign up etc can only print  photo before it freezes up so need to exit and restart app before printing another one prints have an orange tint to it tried changing new paper cartridge  still got the same results perhaps i received a defective item look at photo attached of what i submitted to the app  whats printed faces looks like orangesprints have orange tint to it
6988,2,fell apart when i tried to take off the included zoom lens like literally went to pieces i feel like its just not that well made  i did purchase another one becuase i need it for my business needless to say i wont be trying the zoom lenslike literally went to pieces
4690,1,using for sentry mode in a  tesla model  and havent had a single issue yet in a month love this as a replacement for the usb stick i was using which didnt worknow this doesnt work either dont recommendwould recommend something else
13258,1,its not goodrice its burning when cookthe product its goodrice cooker
12781,5,i have two other steamers i threw them away this is easy to clean easy to use and i love cosorithe best
8487,2,camera made me giggle the first few times i used it its fun for sure when it works i am writing this from china where i was an idiot and brought this as my only camera other than my cell my first day here and a total of  pics total since purchase i got to take  pictures of my family and then the camera bricked there is an e shown on the remaining frame window tried the reset trick and charging the battery super bummer since the intent was to give pictures to everyone in the village for a camera that cost as much as a super reliable digital ps and pics that are  each i was hoping wed fare a bit better than  shots before it  frames shot and it bricked
3504,2,the specialized memory cards for my old camera now cost  times as much as a new camera costs nowadays so i thought it would be time for an upgrade since this one claims to be a lot more megapixels than my old onebut its a piece of junk battery life is fine but you cant trust anything else about itthe photo quality is wildly inconsistent some pictures come out great some come out blurry  some come out looking like impressionist paintingseverything looks smudgedsometimes it just decides its not gonna take a particular photo at all you snap the shutter but all that records is a black screen when you check it well take the picture again you say but that doesnt change a thing the camera has decreed i dont deserve that shot  will keep returning a black screen until i move somewhere else even if the lighting colors et cet are still the same in the new position occasionally turning the camera off  back on again will trick it into overcoming this tantrum but that fix isnt reliable eithersometimes it captures the picture  lets me see it in the playback mode but then the file magically corrupts itself when i try to transfer it to my computer to share with other peopleit also gets disturbingly warm sometimes so thats worryingive wiped the memory card  returned this hunk of scrap for a full refund dont waste your time on ithorribly unreliable
4828,1,i received the wrong items i have an event tomorrow and ordered the camera with the carrying case batteries and  sheets of film i only received the camera case  sheets of film and a bunch of picture crafting materials and a photo albumno batteries and missing  sheets of film my event is tomorrow so there is no time to replace and i have to go to the store for more film and batteries very very annoyingreceived wrong items
5602,2,im kinda disappointed i was really excited to try this camera the lens is defective causes spots and the batteries were missing i feel like the picture would be decent quality for the price if the lens wasnt defectivedisappointed
394,2,my phone works better than this cameranot worth it
1898,1,order arrived with used film in the film area of the camera and missing film from the order was supposed to arrive with  film but only  was shippedincomplete order
14922,5,its working like a charm and very happy we bought this got extras with the set as wellhappy with this purchase
1365,1,i was using a sandisk  high quality sd card and the data was corruptedi had to format the sd card and the recorded data was lostthere is still no firmware update for this issuesd card failed
7693,1, brand new out the box had multiple issues the sd card they sent with the camera does not work with the camera after following prompts on camera that it needed to be formatted it then told me the card speed was too slow and to replace it or was saying card not found could only add one video but the second issue out the box the wifi setup does not work after following instructions and connecting to the camera as the wifi connection the xdv pro app kept timing out i am going to see if i can get this thing working but if not this will be a return for sure big waste of timeplease dont waste your money on this camera
5702,1,i received opened box and opened packages well one of them i didnt read on the descriptions that this was a used product i would have never ordered and paid full price for thisused opened products
4212,1,unlikable the camera wasnt that great for the photo and it turned out darkunlikable expensive for a blue box and reel when the smartphone takes a better picture than the junk blue boxlikable it was great for short term memories to save it on a hard copylittle girls might insist on buying by influenced by irrationals although i would not recommend the plastic boxunfortunately unlikable 
2688,1,my parents got these cameras for my sons and one is working well but the other will only work if plugged in i ordered a new one to replace it but within just a couple days the new one had to same problem this is so disappointing do not buy i am returning as i cant figure out how to get a hold of the seller to ask what to dostopped working
41,1,the pictures are fuzzy and its better to spend a little extra and get the fuji onenot worth the money
8265,1,daughter loved the camera when it worked for one nighti then tried to set the time for her and now the camera is frozen with the screen on i also made a separate trip to buy an sd card because this one did not come with one as was advertisednow im just waiting for the battery to die and hopefully shut itself off and then i will charge it again to try to get her pictures off and then return itso no sd card and it froze after one night of use overall very disappointedfroze after less than  day of use
4830,1,this product was so disappointing when loading the film for the second time the film would not feed through all the lights started flashing we read in the instructions that when this happens the flashing lights that wont stop there is something wrong with the camera disappointing for our grandsons birthday the film is too expensive to have it wasted will request a refundfilm wont load
9065,1,so the moment i opened my package i could feel through the plastic that half of the cartridge was flat so i opened it and it looked like someone stepped on it pieces of the plastic falling off and the photos were exposed i tried my best to make the cartridge usable to my avail it worked i just had to rip some plastic off but the camera registered it ok then i took a test picture and i knew it was too good to be true the ink made the picture nearly impossible to make outif it werent for the product to be damaged this would be a  star review easy waste of  bucks tbhcame damaged and the photos were unsalvagable
6999,1,takes good pics but it started not turning on once in awhile  now it just doesnt turn on at all  prolly dont buy ittrash
3955,1,this thing is garbage it must be some secondhand thirdparty product distributor or some thing the camera does not came straight on so when you print the photo its proportionately distorted also the lights on the front do not work to change the functionality from indoor to outdoor settings snaps on the case were dysfunctional and im overall very dissatisfied with this product hoping to get a refund somehowthird party distribution terrible product
208,2,thought this would be a step up from my rebel  but it was actually a steo down focus is slow no continuous options no touch screen like my older camera seems like canon rushed this to production i dont recommend this camera to anyone nor beginnersstep down
8814,1,camera was over exposed right out of the boxdo not recommend
6696,1,doesnt work no sim card comes with itno good
3834,1,the camera doesnt accept sd card so its basically useless for a toy which is basically what this is its way too expensive and faultydont waste your money
9475,4,my husband is seriously obsessed with this rice cooker my only complaint is the measuring cup it comes with isnt an actual measurement so if you lose it or it brakes your rice is kinda screwedworks amazing
10476,5,this was what my husband wanted for fathers day he is the only one that eats rice so this was the perfect size he uses it everyday its easy to clean as the bowl can be removed and is small for easy storageuse it everyday
372,1,freezes every time dont waste your moneygarbagedoesnt work dont bother
4298,2,it started out a pretty nice bag its limited on space but i knew that ordering it this was nice to hike with and easy to wear slightly awkward to get into with a camera but understandablethe issue for me has been that i store it hanging from the attached hangar loop and within a year the fabric has ripped from hanging the backing is separating from the top zipper pouch i need a new bag after only a year and a half decent bag  but dont store hanging up  set it on a shelf
9135,1,big waste of money the film amazon sent me was for a christmas gift  however the film sent to me expired june of  first photo i took never developed  one slight image but mostly just gray will not buy again from amazonterrible quality
14502,5,i love it worth it get itgreat investment
5329,1,didnt work and it was my granddaughters christmas giftdidnt work and it was my granddaughters christmas gift
5288,1,it didnt work we had to send it back wouldnt focusnet
6308,1,i purchased this for my daughters birthday and the camera just randomly stopped working i tried the instructions and what it said to do nothing worked and that was it my daughter was pretty crushed because she absolutely loves taking and printing her own pictures and while it did work for less then a week my daughter loved it its such a shame it just stops working after only using it for about a week this company is such a big disappointmentdont get this unless you want to be disappointed
11069,5,i literally use this rice cooker for every thing its my baby and i live laugh love her so much its so small and convinient i just be using tiy for everything at this pointamazing live laugh love it
876,1,i am a teacher and i purchased this camera to quickly capture student work i thought the students would really enjoy the polaroid function and seeing photos displayed we are now on day  of school and the camera has stopped working after consulting the manual and several online posts the only solution i found was to remove the batteries while the camera is on to reset the camera although resetting the camera this way works it is just not practical to take this step between every photo especially while working with students i am disappointed that i will not be able to use this camera as i intended and i would have returned it however this problem began one day after the return window closed i would not recommend this productnot good quality
781,2,this is the most difficult camera to work with that ive had in years in low light the photo is either too dark or the flash overexposes the image outside the images are okay thoughcan not get a good picture in low light
6187,1,i bought this to use for outdoor sport action shots  where i have to continually change the length of the lends this product does not have room for you to manually zoom in and out and even if i am able to get my fingers on the lens to zoom in or out the velcro strap does not stay put and where do the camera straps go this might be a good option for still photography on a tripod but not action shots sending it backnot good for outdoor action shots
3643,1,i wish there was an option for zero stars the camera doesnt work dont waste your time and money tried taking about  pictures and it only actually worked twice very disappointeddoesnt work
2514,1,terrible camera broke in two daysdont buy
5623,2,cheap quality and poor photospoor quality photos
1101,1,edit this company has emailed me  times offering gift cards   and finally  in exchange for removing my negative review this is a terrible and dishonest business practice the only purpose of which is to continue to deceive potential customers into buying a poor quality item do not buy from themi have been in the market for a camera for a while so when i saw this  camera on sale for  off and with great reviews i jumped at the opportunityonce it arrived and i took it out of the packaging i was instantly disappointed it is very lightweight and the body feels cheap the swivelscreen is loose and the whole thing feels like it would break very easily it has customizable settings for photos but they are very broad and basic there is no finetuning i set up my ring light and made my kids pose for portraits and took photos outside my cell phone camera takes brighter more crisp photos i was incredibly disappointed and will be returning this productif you want a camera for your children or dont mind grainy photos this is probably fine if youre looking for high quality images this is not the one for youfeels cheap photos are poor quality
8588,1,worked great now it wont even register on my pcdied on me
1442,1,this is nothing but a cheap overpriced piece of junki had to use a srew driver to get the battery compartment to openthen could not get it closedbuyer bewarethis is total junk
8051,2,for the price of the camera and filters coming out to a whopping  after tax and the name of the product having the word kit in it really makes it seem like it contains film i bought this so me and my boyfriend could have photo memories together i opened this up as soon as it arrived to find it not containing film and i was very upset i dont think for the price and what this is its worth the money to buy film separately let alone if its  photos for  probably better to buy a cheaper cameradeceitful product name  advertises like it comes with film
6480,1,i purchased this and it came with no power source i purchased batteries and light does not work waste of spaceuseless
9794,5,had for awhile now and love iteasy
14295,4,so far ive only made brown rice in this  it came out great but i found several things about the instructions were unclear to me does white rice refer strictly to the basic longgrained white rice or does it include others also like white jasmine  white basmati can you cook those can you cook those on the quick cook cycle can you use the steamer basket with any settings other than the quick rice setting or can i steam fish while cooking brown rice my first attempt at that didnt go so well so i was extremely pleased with the rice but feel the manual needs a little more consideration for those of us who are newbies to fuzzy logic cookersthe cooker looks sturdy seems wellmade and was easy to clean the keep warm setting is great the handle to make moving it to a serving area is a nice feature too 
6159,1,i looked cheap everything in this bundle was sub paryggdrasil foo lhfoufoydoyd
5563,1,we are really disappointed in this camera we bought it for our daughter for her  birthday and almost every picture is over exposed we looked for a solution online and the only thing we could find was to hold up sunglasses in front of the lens when taking pictures but that isnt really possible for our daughter and her little hands she needs both to hold the camera we keep trying new things to fix it but we have gone through a bunch of film with no solution try another modelover exposure is a big problem
14718,5,i love this product i have purchased  i gave it as a gift easy to use easy to clean and easy to enjoy whatever you made will soon purchase a  from the same companylove rice even more
302,1,wanted a second camera that was more point and shoot camera did not meet expectations and there was no communication with the seller would not recommendpass on this
11241,4,super cute i really like everything about the look so far ive only cooked brown rice in it but the rice came out fine my only complaint so far since ive only used it  is that the water from the steam hole puddles on the tops and also puddles along the rim of the insidesteam puddles on the top
292,1,do not order  please this is a warning i ordered the  hand and had to return it this camera has a manufacturer disfunction i took it to best buy and they said they camera didnt work and had a system error manufacturer error seems like great price but this camera is a waste of money and time do not buy manufacturer error in the camera
7462,2,bikers in the clear  anyone else beware camera itself seems fine but please dont get me started on the attachments these are the most crappy confusing and horrible attachments i have ever seenthe only way to attach a strap is to the bottom of the case  which is super awkward for if youre planning to use it for snorkeling or water related  which is what its advertised to doif you want a hand mount youll have to pay separate as there is no handle  i was hoping the random piece of plastic in my first photo was something i could attach to hold without manhandling the camera but no dice its not even listed in the user manual which by the way is incredibly hard to read and understand how to put the  plastic parts together to get what you want hoping i can find some sort of comparable hand mount before my trip you get what you pay for plus some random items that have zero use for the camera
4425,2,ive had  of these over the years they are awesome for a few months but thats it one died just after the warranty expired this  frame was great for a year or so too but since then it freezes often showing a partially pixelated image or simply shows the whole slide show with about half of the pictures displaying properly  stars for several months  stars thereafterdoesnt last long
2689,2,seriously bummed about this it was my daughters favorite christmas gift and she went to town on taking photos unfortunately the next day it would not turn on even after being charged with a proper charger and everything now were in search of the same type but one that wont immediately stop working huge waste of moneywouldve been amazing if it didnt stop working  hours in
7805,1,the spine of this album cracked immediately when my daughter opened it unfortunately my return window closed last week so im out of luck the pockets for holding the pictures are nice thoughbroke immediately
3339,1,brought this camera and it doesnt work needs to be plugged in to turn on even though it says full batterydoes not work
1993,2,i got the camera but the film that is shown in the pic was not with itno film
3277,1,soon it was unreasonably badone star
2884,2,i got this camera for my  year sons birthday and arrived just in time for the party regrettably upon inspection the box has suffered partially damaged giving it the appearance of a product that is not entirely brand new however im pleased to report that the camera itself remains undamaged my son promptly opened the package proceeded with the setup process but unfortunately his enthusiasm quickly waned as he left the camera untouched in a disheartened state merely ten minutes later the captured imaged exhibit a noticeable level of blurriness and the color settings prove to be rather perplexingi would advise against purchasing this camera if your intention is to find a device that can truly engage and satisfy the interested of a child in this age groupnot a quality camera we expected
14920,4,if you dont turn it off right after the rice is done it starts to burn the rice and stick to the bottomvery small but works well
8652,1,all the pictures taken blurr since the camera has no antishakebad quality
4196,1,we bought this camera for our son the light is always blinking and we cannot take pictures the filealways looks exposed not a good purchasenot working
9021,2,you can not use the usb port to charge the camera and also operate the camera at the same timeyou can not use the usb port to charge the 
5026,1,camera wont take pictures already been open two days we have tried everything from changing the batteries to wasting a whole new package of pictures nothing works light comes on but camera refuses to take any picturesfor this price just buy a nice small digital camera and pay  to print the pictureswont take pictures within two days of opening
9070,1,ordered july   for a wedding pictures were awful checked to discover that film had expired in february so we lost  and a lot of fun memoriesexpired
14892,4,i washed and dried this rice cooker as soon as i received it so i could make some rice i was disappointed that the measuring cup and spoon were missing from the order i used my own measuring cup and added a cup of rice for practice and added the required  water within  minutes i had nice fluffy rice i noticed some rice stuck to the bottom of the cooker so i reread the directions best to add butter or cooking spray to the rice so the rice wont stick next day i made  cups of rice added the butter and had perfect rice this cooker is small enough to sit on my counter easy to clean makes great rice now that im a pro i will add beans chicken and veggies for my next easy quick mealgreat rice cooker
16986,5,this is better than most of those cheap rice cookers it cooks the rice decent but sometimes how much water youre suppose to put in kinda depends on the type of ricenice rice cooker for a apartment
17692,5,"ive wanted a zojirushi rice cooker for some time but since i dont make rice more than one a week i wasnt sure if it was worth the money to replace the cooker i currently have it isfor starters the zojirushi is so much nicer made than the instant and hamilton beach rice cookers i have used in the past its well made robust feeling and the retractable cord is a thoughtful additionthe zojirushi us easy to use has a large display and is silent while working it makes perfect white jasmine and brown rice the display is easy to read and i like that it shows the town remaining for the entire cooking period previous rice cookers i have used only showed the time remaining in the last  minutes the keep warm setting works perfectlyall in all a great rice cookerworth the money"
11236,1,stopped working after three weeks of my purchase i only used twice before that tried to call and email the customer service but no response so far dont recommend this productbroke in three weeks no lights on
7426,2,this camera was a huge disappointment the images look awful compared to polaroid cameras the square requires a ton of light and offers less dynamic range compared to polaroids instant cameras of old i dont know how fujifilm could be great with digital and analog yet mess up trying to compete against polaroidawful image quality
3995,1,very bad quality of photosvery bad quality of photos
13905,4,great rice cooker but doesnt tell you the amount of water to use per rice and the other this it that the clock is great even if it loses power it keeps up to the time but its only  hour clock so your not going to get  pm just  but some problems
12249,4,"update jan  after almost  yrs still going strong  admittedly we dont make rice every day tho noticed several reviews complained of damage in shipping or unexpectedly quick demise we fortunately have no problems to relatenote the cooker insert is dwsafe being nonstick coated but the interior aluminum lid which must be cleaned every time is best handwashed dw detergent eats aluminum and will slowly destroy it so just spend the  seconds it takes to spongewash and rinse cleanoriginal  rvw heres our experience since  with  brands of rice cookers were asian and eat a lot of ricepanasonic  fuzzylogic  electronic rice cooker current model is the panasonic  fuzzy logic  made the best tasting rice con took the longest to cook biggest con it died in  yrs which for the price was unexpected and dismayingaroma  cooked digital rice cooker turned out to be much smaller in quantity of rice cooked than the panasonic  cups cooked is  bowls of rice max no seconds  soupsized bowls not those idiotic minirestaurant bowls that no asian ever uses at home pro cooked faster than panasonic con rice didnt taste anywhere near as good biggest con impossible to clean took hard constant work to keep black mold from formingzojirushi  micom rice cooker and warmer largest in quantity of the  weve tried still a reasonable footprint handle is good but rice pan markings are painted on not molded in easier to see but will probably wear off if this cooker lasts as long as we hope it doespros almost as fast as the aroma cooker but rice still does not taste quite as good as it does with the panasonic easiest to clean of all interior lid pops off for cleaning snaps back in easily always wipe off the rubber seal asap after cooking rice no spillovers yet but its big inside and im only cooking at half its capacity right now cannot figure out how to clean vent areacons programming setup is a little more complicated than the panasonic the panasonic wins easily over both aroma and zoji for sheer ease of use but the panasonic isnt programmable for future start so its a simpler menu system of just plug and gooverall satisfied with the zoji and will update if theres any problems in the futurevery good cooker vs panasonic and aroma"
1418,2,there is no flash and the picture turn out poor quality not worth the money pent on itno flash poor photo quality
3020,1,looks like crap dirty and broken right out of the boxjunk
3340,1,camera doesnt work wont accept any memory card and cant save photosworst camera ever
5812,2,i bought this camera for photographing my daughters basketball games the zoom is great but it doesnt have the shutter speed to capture these shots its slow i also tried to take some night pictures at a bonfire and it was darkoverall pictures arent any better than my iphone especially for regular shotsnot great for moving shots
561,1,i bought a kodak  hoping it would be easy to use how naive of me it lasted  years and  months and now wont download photos onto my computer it has historically produced fuzzy pictures and gobbles up batteries it was a pain keep having to turn it on all settings checked etc frankly i am glad to bin it it cost me   insurance which typically ran out  months before it packed up iam going back to the brownie   if there is any oldie who remembers them  
347,2,it is a neat camera packed with features but it really fell short when i found out it takes standard nonrechargeable batterieswhat is the deal with old style non chargeable batteries
3874,1,the camera can be on auto focus and looking straight at you and will not focus on your face that is trashdont buy the camera for auto focus because it doesnt have it
8545,1,i dont think ive been just unlucky got this camera in june as a gift didnt work we got it replaced and after a few pics it stopped working again still flashing e in the back ended up returning in even if i had already bought a case and film for it do not trust this brandi did because of all these good reviewsfirst one didnt work flashing e on the back and neither the second replacement
14762,5,"just me so i generally only make  cups rice enough for two meals for me keeps rice warm till next day without smell ive forgotten it over the weekend and rice does smell a bit but not close to as bad as others ive used in the past everything comes apart easily for basic cleaningwhat gets to me is the learning curve of how to operate customize settings once set its as simple as pressing a button unless you want to set cook times but navigating the menu is codic so youll need to spend a little bit of time to familiarize yourself with it i like it and would buy again for myself or as a gift for familybeen good to me so far"
10201,5,works like a charm convenient size for  people fast deliverysolid
2665,2,too small for my  year old to handlevery small
5389,1,product did not come with a sd card it turns on but the screen is blackdoes not work
1774,1,this is the  time ive bought this camera and it stopped working so quick the battery explodes in the camera for both of my orders it seems like only way for it to work would be removing the battery as soon as you are done using it i wouldnt recommend this camera try another polaroid camera option it was a waste of money  time buying doesnt last
4870,1,terrible waste of moneypictures do not develop dont buy this
1935,2,i ordered the camara for my girlfriend and it advertised to give  sheets but we only received  sheets and  stickers why does it say  sheetsnot all the film came
1825,2,in broad daylight the pictures are fine though not super sharp but a little less than that forget about it i took the photo w the trees and the man around  w pretty decent daylight and the black one thats from the regular function straight up not working the shutters literally dont open only the selfie mode works what a waste of  of film and my brothers first visit to me in years amazon is shipping me a replacement but its not like im getting a refund for the film or a way to recover these memories w my brother idk if id buy this knowing what i know nowdark photos shutter doesnt work except for selfie mode
4651,2,worked for a little while and then broke today after sitting in my drawer for a few months i put it in my macbook and it wasnt recognized i tried multiple ports it wasnt until i took it out and brought it close to me that i could smell that it was burned it had a familiar burned pcb smell fortunately my memory card was still ok i have a second one of these that still works so hopefully i just got a bad unit and their qc sucksworked for a little while and then burned out
8724,1,bought this for my binoculars to use with an iphone  max it was difficult to get it to work asked several other people to try in case i was missing something our results were the same difficult to get installed once it was on it hardly seemed worth the effort it was heavy so for any extended use youd have to use a tripod very disappointing plus i bought it for a trip and the return window ended while i was away so im stuck with itheavy cumbersome ineffective tool
8492,1,ugh i was so excited to buy and use this so excited that i decided to pay extra and use the great extra features with this camera instead of the fujifilm instax mini  when i received it the box was a little banged up i thought ok thats just the box and everything inside looks okwell the battery stopped working after not too long so i bought a new one on amazon and i was good to goexcept for when it just stopped working completely and the display showed e i assume for error at first i thought it was a film error maybe i was out so i opened the back and of course the remaining exposures got wasted i googled high and low with no answers on how to fix this expensive purchase i had mademaybe dont buy this camera if you dont want to waste all the money youve spent on this camera plus film plus and extra battery because the battery that the camera came with didnt last for some reasonheadaches
2853,1,this thing sucks what picture quality absolutely nonecrappy camera
9006,2,i like the camera i like the potential of the camera however the  i received has a bubble inside the lens it doesnt affect the photos that much unless you look for a tiny smear in every picture you take i have contacted panasonic ten times now and sent the amazon receipt for the warranty to cover the lens and all panasonic and do is tell me i need to send them a receipt i am one pissed off consumer i have always used canon products and never had a problem they even replaced a  when it was one month beyond the warranty you must factor these opinions in when you pay the big dollars to get electronics needless to say this is my last panasonici like the camera
13074,5,this is perfect for people that like fancier things and need the bells and whistles it is big about the size of the instant pot duo but has a more square shape the labeled buttons make it easy to understand and use cooks more than just rice cleans up pretty easilymulti use
6251,2,the reason why is the cover makes it hard for the camera to detect the amount of light available i planned on using this for a boating trip and wanted to use my cameras auto feature but the pictures took to long to take i ended up putting the camera in my water proof bag and not taking any pictures the fit was alright for my nikon  what i wanted
13790,4,"all functions works well as statedbut one thing i didnt like is the plastic smell when unit was runningand did notice it is made in chinaall works well except smell"
9363,5, this is a nice rice cooker the size is perfect for a family of  to  its made well and is an attractive steel with a good insert and comes with a steamer basket and a spoon and measuring cup which is small it feels solid and doesnt take up that much space the top is plastic but feels good doesnt seem cheap at all i made a small amount of rice and it came out good although i put a little more water in it than it called for im used to making rice on the stove and having a rice maker like this makes it a little more convenient because it automatically keeps it in a warming mode after its cooked this would make a nice gift alsogood size rice cooker
9453,1,received the rice cooker and it works fine rice comes out perfect slow cooked a recipe and it came out wonderful used it a total of five times when i removed the inner pot for cleaning i noticed that on the heating plate a really bad burn about the size of a dime that had black specs and the metal coating on the plate is coming off the bottom of the pot was fine and not scorched returning for a replacement i did notice that the mode is different on this machine than on my friends in the uk our mode screen when pressed brings up options slow cook where the uk version comes up with soups cakes and more odddefective
96,2,we opened and shut the battery door about  times and then it got stuck and we couldnt ever get it open again this is more like a toy than a cameravery cheap build more like a toy than a camera
6623,1,had this camera just over one year it stopped working focused very slow so missed a lot of shots this was a very well taken care of camera and stopped working just after he warranty very very disappointed i would not but itcamera stopped working right after warranty expired dont buy
5071,1,dont waste your money the reviews over hype it i takes pictures like a cheap camera should they arent even close to  and has serious issues with focusing dont waste your moneyyou get what you pay for
7276,1,i have had this camera since december  and have not yet seen any video the camera does not interface with the computer even after uninstalling and reloading the free software off of the gopro site it corrupted my computers hard drive after contacting the gopro help center via email the only option i was given a list of technical questions to answerquestions that if i were able to answer them i would have most likely been a gopro camera designer not userthis product is absolute crap do not buy a goprogo elsewhere not gopro
3042,2,the picture quality is very bad especially indoors forget low light it is blury in medium light if you want a disposable pice of junk for one time use maybe  but it is not going to take good pictures unless you are outside in the sun it is very hard for a child to use the buttons are are tiny and hard to push a and you can not read the symbols on them but the menus are inposible to use anyway the batery lasts about one or two hours the worst thing is that the battery compartment flap opens all the time i dont know if they are all this bad or if mine is defective but the flap wont stay closed and the lightest brush agaisnt it makes it pop open the zoom works but takes a long time to use and the buttons are small and stiff the lens is fixed and does not move though it is made to look like it comes out this is an illuion it does not the lens is plastic with no way to cover it so it will get dirty and scratched quickly and easily i bought it for my kids but it was suposed to be an up grade fropm the toddler play camera they had this is about the same picture quality but harder to useeven lower than my expectations
4230,1,the pictures are bad quality i returned and got my refundbad quality
3260,1,what a piece of junk picture quality is low with grainy odd color saturated photos has a ridiculously slow shutter button delay the flash isnt a flash its nothing but a weak useless light that has no useful purpose this camera is a ripoff and is barely a kids toy its falsely represented as a legitimate camerajunk
2835,1,im so sad i was so excited for this camera to take lots of pictures of my  year old i took so many cute pictures and it deleted them all with no warning multiple times i wanted to capture memories of my son but instead memories were destroyed so annoyed definitely dont waste your moneyhorrible
2241,1,first camera i received didnt turn on at all got a replacement and it didnt turn on at first but then it finally randomly started working the camera quality is awful and definitely not  i wish i could return this camera and get my money back i wouldnt recommend this camera to anyone honestly but you get what you pay forwaste of money
2375,1,my camera came broken  doesnt work  and its unfortunate because i paid  camera
8766,2,i received this package today the film is expired and doesnt work for over  you would think this product would work properly pictures come out white or brown super disappointeddoesnt work properly
4589,1,stopped working and have no been able to get it fixed and not able to get a hold of anyone to help get it fixeddoes not work
4092,2,just set it up today so far given the high price im disappointed with flexability and software while it is working and the image quality is decent it lacks many of the standard functions i would expectfirst problem is there is no detection zone configuration none so its full zone detection which can force very hard angles or you have it constantly making  second clips of things just out of frame motion this lack of tuning is totally amateurish most security cameras have multi zone prioritythe outdoor mount is a piece of cheap garbage with poor adjustments and cheap aluminum screws meaning your magnetic screw driver heads wont work it also has no real ability to secure the arlo but you cant just must mount it high because of the zone issueyou cant flip the image in case under mounting would give a better angle seriously correction this setting was just stuck somewhere away from the main config so good half point increase  the arlo itself lacks reasonable physical security attachment points that is mind numbing stupid and screams style over functionill see how i feel in a week and if i get a better sense for battery life off the cuff given the preium price im left disappointed and may return and get some hard wired units or something most of this could be fixed by software probable except the utter lack of physical security considerationsedit after  hours i have had it this thing has the worse detection model ever unless you can positioning it where a body moved cleanly from one side of the frame to the other it wont pick anything up without the sensitivity maxed anything heading stright toward it rails until the last second making it useless for getting facesit falsely triggers on cars going by when well out of frame any light reflected at them triggers a false record yet it cant see somebody walking right at them without  sensitivity across yes at no this engine driving these things is just awful im lowering my rating and returning unless you have a very specific side view medium viewer with no possible out frame motion this camera is a wast of timebad physical security no zone control weak software
194,1,i bought this because of all the great reviews and this was huge mistake there is no focus on it it doesnt lock in on an object and focus correctly the pictures looked low quality compared to my other cannondont believe the reviews
8325,2,not so good the picture quality is just okaynot so good
11108,4,i only used this to cook rice it was quick and sufficient cant say anything about steaming veggies or anything but i will say if you are a college student this is quick and easy to usegood
17630,5,i absolutely love this pot food is easy to stew and easy to clean ive been using it for two and a half years now the liner is worn out like this will it still work how can i get a new linerhow can i get a new liner
7755,1,i would give this zero stars if i could doesnt come with cord to charge my niece was excited to receive this gift but was unable to use it right away because it did not come with a charge or charger cheap looking and not at all durable for kids what a disappointmentdisappointing present 
1396,2,decent camera for starters but audio is very poor audio poor
3482,1,bought this camera for my daughters bday had the same issue as some are saying here with cutting off the subject of the picture even though it is perfectly framed in view finder we tested this out many times holding the camera in different ways but every time the subject was printed completely off centered and cut off even when perfectly centered in viewfinder until this is fixed dont buy this camera its sad because otherwise it was a cute camera and could have been a good alternative to the polaroid instaxcuts off subject
7627,2,these are definitely not for photography small and weak they would be good as a desk lamps good for a streaming setup they are powered by usb if you are doing phography stay away get something else 
2352,1,worked for a week and then wouldnt charge it is a cheap one off that doesnt work and we cant return itstopped charging
384,2,it is not that good of a camera dies really fast although its does comes with two batteries i just would have rather not purchased quailing is grainy as hell  but you get what you pay fori was let down
1991,2,initially when the picture came out a bit darker i realised that i had taken in inside the house with lights the next day i tried clicking in natural bright light with and without the flash i was very excited to get the camera returning it my instax mini  clicks better pictures than this dont know if the device quality is bad or it was a defective piece im extremely disappointed with the resultsdisappointed with the picture quality
2596,1,very cute pink camera camera case and flamingopalm treebeach photo case but it doesnt work unfortunately im in the process of returning this item nowcamera doesnt work
3027,1,this item isnt renewed its refurbished big difference false advertising so do not purchasefalse advertising
11075,5,i love this little product its quick to use and clean and easy to store my only recommendation is to add just a little more water then the fill lines to you use it just add the rice add the water put in the heat with the lid on and press the button down it figures out when its done and switches to warm mode cooks up to  cups use it all the timesuper easy to use and clean
7823,2,ive had a zink printer in the past i got it from a kickstarter and the brand was called prynt but the companion app went out of service last year so i got this one to replace my old printer expecting it to be even better than my  year old one that is not the case maybe its user error but only one of the five photos i printed came out correctly every other photo started printing before the paper was rolling so it left a large white gap on the tail end i also got two paper jams and between printing each photo i had to force quit the app or else it would sit on a loading screen indefinitelythe loading screen thing happened with my old one too so i wasnt too upset about that but combined with all the other issues ive run into ive decided to count it among this printers faults i tried all sorts of different paper positioning before each print to see if it was my fault they werent loading properly but with only five chances i didnt get much data so i have to blame the machinein the photo attached i purposely covered portions of the prints to hide faces and i put heavy filters on the photos so im not judging color accuracyim really bummed this kodak printer isnt even on par with my old oneunreliable prints
2092,1,the lights on the camera just kept flashing i removed the batteries that came with it and put in new batteries and same thingcamera didnt work
6130,2,it worked well briefly but now after a few uses you have to replace the batteries it doesnt hold a charge at all you take a couple pictures and its dead horrible producthorrible product
1007,2,horrible doesnt charge well the charge does not last and the screen gets hot charging it as well as when you use it i will be returning this cameraawful
6649,1,one star because we already know its a cheap camera so you are going to get what you pay for but its giving  thats ok you can fix the settings my issue is soon as you take it out the box problems sim card wont activate the camera just too much this camera is not really for blogging per say more like i want to start learning how to use a camera i dont want to spend the money for it and taking like cute photos in the more  lookummmm no
2226,2,pics sometime dont come out most are very blurrybad quality
622,1,quality wasnt good battery life wasnt good and made a bad noise when trying to use itehh wasnt the best
13944,5,super easy set up and usage just plugged it in and set to white rice and got amazing cooked riceeasy to use
4602,1,camera failed and returning to try another onebroken after  photos
9683,5,never used a rice cooker before and decided to try one i can literally throw in rice and turn this sucker on and forget about it while i cook the rest of dinner and when i hear it ding i know the rice is perfect every time will never go without it againwhere has this been all my life
5979,1,i hate to give a bad review but buyers beware the camera shuts off over heats bought the battery and memory card still overheats tried taping my daughters rock show inside ac environment it shut off  minutes no joke i used my phone instead i am a soccer coach tried taping practice or parts of the game as a training tool the camera would shut down shame on this companybuyer beware
6815,1,we purchased the camera and memory card as specified by amazon and the manufacturer the camera would not work it just kept saying it couldnt read the memory card ended up returning bothcould not get camera to work with memory card
3660,1,my product wont turn on after swapping batteries and checking to ensure theyre loaded correctly no blinking light at all product was not droppedbroke after very light use
9479,4,the aroma rice cooker came the next day as was scheduled i used it the day after i needed something small and easily stored on a shelf since my counter space is minimal simple no trying to figure out numerous functions the rice cooked and turned itself off when finished and goes to warm mode until you unplug it the only thing i will do differently the next time i use it is add a little more than one cup of water per cup of rice because the bottom of the rice was ever so slightly scorched didnt affect the taste for my personal taste rice could have been a little softer all in all im very happy with my purchasesmall and simple
6370,2,overall picture quality was better than expected i thoroughly enjoyed getting into the spring and capturing fish and scenery on the fourth trip to the spring i discovered the camera would no longer power on battery was fully charged no deformity on the internal power button and no resolving the problem beyond the return period and no way to use the camera unfortunateworked great three times
7605,1,these are some cheap lights better to spend your money on something betterget what you pay for
2072,1,i used to think that polaroid made a difference in the world i used to think that polaroid was concerned with excellence and quality however i now realize that that just isnt the case this camera is the worst example of what polaroid has to offer and a real disappointment if im being frank slow to print and low definition doesnt make the grade when compared to other high quality instant print camerasfails to make the grade
9370,5,i have a tiger  rice cooker that works but the inside pot is peeling and ive been waiting for the replacement to come back in stock for months this is the second pot ive had to replace so i decided to purchase this rice cooker as the replacement for my existing rice cooker the cost of this new cosori rice cooker is almost the same as a replacement pot for my old one it looks great and the footprint is about the same as my old rice cooker its just taller and this makes more rice we eat rice almost daily so that is the main purpose so i havent tried the other functions the only drawback is the front lights stay on after the rice cooks so unless you have the rice on warm the machine has to be unplugged after making rice i wish there was a poweroff button so the other function lights on the front panel would turn offreplaced my tiger rice cooker
17316,5,"this rice cooker was expensive when i bought it and its gone up in price now that im looking for a second smaller one i have the  cup and am considering adding the  cup due to i like brown rice and the rest of my family prefers white the expense however is the only con after over  years of owning it and honestly its been worth every penny so i dont really consider it a conwe had gone through probably  different cheaper rice cookers over the years you know those common models where it has one button to start and a glass lid while a few of them did jasmine rice pretty good none of them could do both brown and jasmine rice perfectly this one does if youve only ever had the one button rice cookers with the glass lid and you move to this one its like going from an old base model toyota tercel from the  to a nice modern lexus sedan night and day differencethe rice cooks perfectly every time seriously almost every time we have dinner guests over someone comments on how good the rice is which if you think about it is kinda exceptional i mean its just rice right by itself its a fairly boring basic thing and yet this rice cooker makes it better than a standard rice cooker or what an average person can achieve on a stove i say average person because one of my friends whose a chef his stove top rice cooking skill rivals it i cant do it but this machine is like having him in my kitchen every time i make ricebut its not just the perfect rice this machine keeps rice good and warm and ready for anyone to have a serving for days those one button rice cookers we used to own even the better ones that could do a good pot of jasmine you had to get it out of there by the next day or it was going to get bad this allows us to have cheap warm good food ready across days i made a pot yesterday at the time of this writing and i just had perfect jasmine rice with sardines for lunch ill have a perfect rice with grilled mackerel later and ill have perfect rice with my beans tomorrow at lunch if my kids are hungry in the middle of the day and they want a quick something theres warm rice and usually something in the fridge to throw on top of it quick and easy and far healthierusually than microwavable frozen foodnow if you only eat rice once in a while and its not a staple in your house and money is an object then this is probably overkill youre not going to get your money back in the convenience and higher quality of your staple like you absolutely will if rice is a staple of your diet but if it is a staple and youve only ever used those cheaper one button rice cookers with the glass lids and especially if youre trying to use brown rice to eat healthier this rice cooker will be worth every penny pot after pot of perfect rice regardless of what kind of rice you cook in it and if rice isnt currently a staple for you but money is no object and you buy this dont be surprised if rice becomes a staple the convenience of this with the quality of rice it makes may well lead to you eating it far more oftenand for those of you who are into gaba rice you dont need to buy special gaba rice this will turn brown rice or other whole grain ricewhite rice is not whole grain and cant be turned into gaba into gaba for you it takes longer to cook about  and half hourson the gaba setting the regular brown rice setting is  minutes but youre talking about getting gaba for a fraction of the cost just checked here on amazon gaba rice is going for about  bucks a pound if you buy it in a one pound bag at my local winco brown jasmine in the bulk section is like a buck something for a pound and if you buy it in  pound bags like i do on sale you can get it for well under a dollar a pound so you will very quickly recoup the costs of this rice cooker if youre currently buying special gaba rice regularly as you can just buy a whole grain rice and use the gaba setting to activate itturn it into gaba riceso in closing there are many kitchen appliances that promise to deliver perfect this or perfect that with greater convenience and few of them really deliver but this rice cooker absolutely does when it comes to rice i can not imagine going back to one of those cheap one button glass lid setups theyre just a significant downgrade i would absolutely miss this if i had to do thatover four years later and still cooking flawless rice operating exactly like brand new"
14262,5,have used this rice cooker for months already and did not have any issue with it as long as i follow the water level instructions inside the rice comes out good no rice got burnt and stuck to the bottom like some other brands good productvery good rice cooker
7212,2,quality is fine but doesnt work with sony  iii due to shutter button placementnot for sony
3845,1,camera was used with other peoples pictures on the camera also the bottom sim card cap was brokenproduct was used
4899,1,our business has gone through a handful of these cameras i bought  more in october  and by feb   of them wont turn on i don not recommend these as long term camerasgood for  months
5355,2,its very heavy and hard to adjustits a haevy softbox
70,2,this is a pitifully poor camera that takes fuzzy  low resolution images all kidsin todays world  comparing it with their cell phone pictures would pitch it intothe garbage bin which is where mine found its resting place  it serves nopurpose whatsoever  it is not at all a point and shoot as they were at one timean item that serves no purpose whatso ever
4034,2,i have had the  camera system sine around february  in theory it is a good concept as you do not have to have a contract or have some expensive wiring done the system is easy to set up and the cameras have a good picture quality when they work it really only took me about an hour after i got the system to get it up and running i have read comments are reviews of the product and there seems to be similar issues i bought this system as a direct result of someone breaking into my car right next to my house in my driveway while i was home one night since i am a female who may be home alone at times this was a huge issue problems i have  when it was cold i had the low battery reading issue this was a known problem and they ended up trying to trouble shoot it by having me update the firmware on the system this worker for a while but i ended up buying extra batteries here on amazon and they are not cheap they were supposed to send me out batteries for both cameras and then only sent one set so i had to call back for the second  i have the system set to auto update the firmware and it does not do that each time i have had to call for support they have had me bring the cameras inside and reset them and update the version  be careful about how sensitive you set the cameras to trigger one there is a small lag time where i was missing the beginning of an event so if someone came on my porch and walked right away the camera would trigger but i would miss the person then when i made it more sensitive i was getting email alerts for each event almost every  minutes from things like cars driving  be careful about the email alerts i was getting so many that my data plan now always goes over limit and i am charged extra by my carrier att told me that just the fact that the emails have picture files attached to them is a data usage and them when you click on the picture to play the event that is another hit on you data plan depending on how long you have set the video  i am now having an issue where the two cameras that i had issues with are again reading low batteries and now there is a warning message that states either the connection has timed out or  a connection cant be made to the media server i just called a little while ago and was given another case number and told this is a known issue and our engineers are working on it if it was a known issue why was i not notified the representative was not able to give me an answer to that nor to how long it could take to resolve the issue it has been going on for at least a week for me but due to my schedule i was not able to call before tonightthis is frustrating as i do not feel that there is a good remedy for some of these issues if this was cable or the phone company you can get a credit or refund for the missed use of the service i asked the representative what they can do and she stated that they do not have the liberty to make any arrangementsi spent  on this system and i feel like it has been a headache and that i have to actively check now to make sure its workingit is a shame because when it works its really good i freaked out the man who comes and shovels my snow in the winter because he just came by one day without calling and started doing the sidewalks he could tell i wasnt home because the car was not in the driveway i called him and tried to reach him to let him know i saw that he had done the sidewalks and to mess with him but he had his phone at his house and didnt get the message until later it was good though because i was able to see he was honest and didnt try anythingoverall i would be happy with the system if it worked like it does sometimes but just be aware of what your getting yourself into when you get the system also i initially liked the system so much that i had only bought the one camera system and i immediately returned it for the  camera systemdo your homework read the rewiews
1623,2,it is not sturdy feeling at all the picture quality is not even close to what is advertised and the battery died in a couple hours at the zoovery cheap
7204,1,dont buy this thingworthless
17581,5," update while it was fantastic while it lasted it suddenly stopped working a few months later the cooker would not turn on at all i contacted the manufacturer directly regarding the warranty after several attempts to contact them over two months with no response and spending over two hours on hold on the phone just to be disconnected twice i contacted amazon customer service for next steps they promptly replaced it with a new one and provided a return label for the faulty item hopefully it was a fluke thing and the second one lasts as long as one would expect for the investment if so i would still rate the cooker five stars along with amazons customer service not so much for the customer service of the manufacturer of the cooker itself  i would rate that part with one starbest rice cooker i have ever usedwell worth the investment"
1239,1,this camera is a cheap knock of from the original and doesnt work as good  pictures dont come out nicelynot worth it 
4270,2,the case is a bit too small but bigger issue is that the adjustable padding has limited configuration options due to use of materials most of the interior uses a slick polyester fabric with patches of soft hoop material sewn in in specific areas this limits the placement of the velcro hooks to these pads this appears to have been a design change as images of older versions appear to have soft material throughout the interior i can not imagine this being a significant cost savings as there is labor cost in the additional sewing also think the product shrank with version revisions which is too bad i was looking at the product dimensions listed in the description which would be the size i needed and not what i got  of disappointment
4837,1,this camera doesnt work ive used   and one  have come out okay the pictures usually come out black with spots ive watched videos on youtube and i know im using it right i would highly not recommend these cameras from this sellerdont recommend
13903,5,this is a beautifully designed product however the manual is not well translated into english i find this cooker works great for low carb rice it is bit pricey for a normal cooker however if however you are looking to enjoy rice without all the carbs this is the real dealworks well as keto rice cooker
8286,1,loved this product for the first couple of days got it for my  year old for christmas  and what a hit the photo quality is acceptable for the age were talking about and the frames and little things you can add to the pic are fantastic however the first one we got wouldnt hold its charge after  dayswouldnt even turn on by the third returned it with no problemsvery easy but the second one worked for about a week and now wont acknowledge theres an sd card in it so we cant even take pictures went to return it today february  but theres no longer an option to return sorely disappointed the idea is so great and the features so good wed be delighted if it worked but a month after giving it now its uselessgreat until a feature breaks a week later
3985,1,never got to use it broken out of the box as was the replacementbroken out of the box
7149,1,it was great at first but it didnt last long i went through maybe printing  pictures and then when it stopped working now the printer wont acknowledge the new film and so it wont print ive tried different packs and made sure that the cartridge is in right but it still doesnt work waste of moneywould have been nice if it worked
1854,2,i ordered the  photos sheets set and the camera only came with  sheets and its missing the wallet and the case but i paid for the entire setmy order is missing some pieces
4030,2,i purchased this camera due to problems i have with ups deliveries even with a big sign on the door expecting delivery please ring doorbell ups will still either drop toss or leave the box in the yard and walk off wnary a doorbell ringordered some fortunately inexpensive items leading up to christmas got a notice on my phone package delivered wth ran outside looked around no box that was the last straw for me long story short the ups driver threw the box into my neighbors yard and when yet another delivery of my stuff to her house came she noticed the other box sitting in her bushes all wet in the rain cant stand ups amazon let me choose my carrier for my packages fedex pleaseordered this camera i even liked the fact it uses batteries and was totally wireless the setup was easy and went without issue recorded video is decent even with night vision set the camera up out my bedroom window pointing down with a full clear view of my front yard  i was ready for my next set of ups misdeliveries to finally have video proof when a box claimed delivered never makes it into my yardthis is when all the negatives of this camera  setup started becoming exposed causing my decision to return itding  at one point i heard some sounds outside a bit after setup night time and i figured let me fire up the app go to live view and see what was happening  opening the app and clicking the live view button  the app spinned spinned and spinned for about    seconds when finally i started getting live  seconds is a lifetime imo when trying to quickly check some sounds or noises going on around your home the live view delay is always there the time may vary a bit but its typically always more than   unfortunately where i live cars regularly pass down my block so no matter how i pointed the camera first including my yard and the street in front or just my front yard woany view of the street when cars would pass beep here comes the push alertsthis is fine and sort of what you want but theres no way for example to mask out areas you dont want motion sensed  even with the camera showing only my front gate and my yard leading up to my front porch i was still getting motion detected from the street lights being reflected off my car in the driveway perhaps still not really sure whythis was actually surprising because when i put the camera in motion detection mode after mounting the camera  floor window for testing a light on the camera flashes denoting detected motion and walking around my yard the camera appeared to hardly sense my presence while walking around unless i was like in the middle of my yard or directly under the windowding   final straw getting annoyed with notifications due to cars passing by i created a mode that only recorded video wosending alerts woke up the next morning with about  alertsit was interesting though to see the timings of the various videos  you can see trends of when the street became less busy etc the one thing that was pretty consistent however was the vehicles that triggered the motion were pretty much way past my house when recorded typically only showing the tail lights of the car  that how long it takes after being triggered for the camera to start recordingi did actually catch the mail man delivering mail that morning  the video show him already in my yard past the open driveway gate placing the mail in the box and then walking out  again the recording delay didnt catch him walking past my neighbors driveway next door and into the yardmy decision to return this camera occurred when i went out later that afternoon to visit family for the holidays i got a single video packing up the car i did not get a video of the car pulling out the driveway as we left the car just disappearedlikewise returning home later that night no video of the car pulling into the driveway but video of my wife getting out the passenger door and walking to the front door  that was it for me  returnsummary  id imagine this camera is great if you live in a rural area without much street traffic great for potentially catching the occasional deer bear or crowbar toting criminal coming into your back yard etc but without the ability of masking out what you dont want motion detected leads to lots of alerts video being recorded and heavy battery use i quickly from experience over time reduced the recording time from  seconds down to about    seconds with the camera being triggered so often in my front yard especially when looking at the video what triggered the camera was already gone leading to  of perhaps just seeing leaves blowing across the lawnif i turn off the motion detection  does the camera even do anything at that point not sure didnt test dont care  its packed back up and ill post my return request shortlydecent camera not practical for busy streets
14847,5,"this little cooker makes the most perfect rice ive ever had it is economical and very easy to use i love that it switches to warm when its finished cookingeach grain of rice was separate each cooked to fluffy fragrant perfection i only wish id purchased it years agoperfection"
2717,1,i purchased a camera for my son  years ago and it still works today unfortunately i bought my daughter the same one in april and it has already stopped working i am past the return date and out  stopped working
3031,1,we had this item purchased off of our registry for us and planned to use it for our wedding we did not test it and make sure it would work until a couple hours before the wedding when the bridesmaids went to take a picture for the photo guestbook and it would not work luckily they sent one of their husbands to walmart to purchase a brand new one which worked great but they threw the brokenrefurbished one in the trash so i wasnt able to return it and get a refund or get it repaireddid not work

9066,1,i opened my box to take the individual packages out of the main box and  of the  boxes was opened and emptied not only are these films pricey but now i didnt even receive all of what i paid forsomeone tampered with this product
7981,1,love the camera and the features for the first  minutes i got to play with it took a while to pair it with my phone which was a bit of a downer but the biggest issue i have with it is the fact it wont do anything when i came to print a picture hell its not letting me do anything i cant view pictures ive taken print pair it or even turn it off 
9077,1,received on june  july  for one year it saysprobably wasnt even kept cool properly eitherbuy ones you can see the exp  days before expired
17334,4,"was so looking forward to getting this cadillac of rice cookers only to have two disappointing surprises when it arrived interfere with a pacemaker ask your doctor with no further information about the emf to provide to the doctor the clock and all timed functions including the keep warm rely on a battery operated clock and that clock battery cannot be replacedi will ask the doctor but will most likely return i could set the timer to delay start and leave the area as a work around for the first issue but that only works as long as the ridiculous battery situation holds up why oh why isnt the clock powered by the plug epic poor designedit my doctor said they have never had any issues with pacemakers and induction cooking equipment so i gave this a try amazing rice apparently the cooker will still cook other than the delay function after the internal battery dies ive been leaving it plugged in hoping the battery will last longer kept back one star because of this ridiculous design component hopefully newer models will correct this glaring flawdisappointing and unfortunate surprise issues but fantastic rice"
1826,2,bought this camera for our wedding to have for the guestbook after about  pictures it stopped working we troubleshooted everything to try and find the issue but it just stopped working and now we only have  of our guestbook signedworked when it worked

14248,5,ive been using this rice cooker weekly for two years it makes incredible rice and it sings the cutest song when its done i dont think ill ever live without a rice cooker againamazing
247,2,update returned camera and it turned out to be a software issue camera worked great for about two months and then the telephoto completely stopped focusing sent back to lumix after  weeks they returned it saying it was fine camera will not focus when the telephoto lens is extended at all a waste of a fair amount of money this is my grab and go camera when i dont feel like dragging the dslr around now it is only good for objects close byordered this camera to use as a bridge camera during my travels worked great at first although the telephoto is not as good as the coolpix liked the feel of it and the ability to shoot raw as well as jpeg however after a little over four months the telephoto refuses to focus there is a blue glitter effect whenever you look through the lens does not show up on photos but disconcerting when trying to set up photo half shutter does not focusi havent even finished paying for this camera and it is not working highly disappointed in the qualitylumix was a highly recommended brand unable to contact through the websitegreat camera while it works
7427,1, defective less than  yr later flashing light indicating failure with no way to fix apparently a common issue dont buydefective
3957,1,this camera was very inconsistent with proper exposure of a picture it came with multiple film refills and each time maybe  or  photos would expose properly out of the  on the cartridge multiple settings on the camera were tried with various lighting sitations the accessories were nice and the camera was asthetically as advertised but the functionality was poordisappointing purchase
12131,4,but sure how the fuzzy technology works but it doesits all about the fuzzy
11202,5,"i absolutely love this rice cooker first and foremost i received this same rice cooker in red as a christmas gift from my mother last year however i felt daunted by it after one use where i didnt properly read the manual and used far too little water and it sat in my cupboard unused for quite a while until my boyfriend threw it out by accident as he thought it did not workon a quest to  make healthier dinner choices and  find a use for the vegetables that i use for my work lunches before they spoil i decided to come back to the original rice cooker that i didnt bother tackling before this time i chose a different color because white was less expensive than any other color  which is always great to remember to doublecheck when youre purchasing on amazon at  compared to what they sell for in local stores roughly around  at time of writing this i felt like it was a good dealfor the beginner to rice cookers you should always remember that you should take every opportunity to spice things up a bit  that is go wild with your spices that you add to your water while it may be silly i didnt even really think about this  i had this vision of vegetables and white rice in my mind when i saw my rice cooker before not true you can change the spices up so many ways to have very different tasting dishes you can also add a chicken bouillon cube for extra flavor  just make sure to stir your rice very well after youve finished cookingin regards to steaming vegetables i often throw an array of vegetables together  leftover onion asparagus cabbage etc i also use frozen vegetables yes frozen i rinse them with hot water under the faucet in a strainer drain and transfer to my steaming plate ive found that they taste just fine in a hurry and quite honestly its a great way to save on grocery costs too i would suggest trying it out i personally like to salt and pepper my vegetables before i put the lid on top since it will fall down into the rice during the steaming process always remember to line the hands up with your rice cooker and steamer since it helps ensure no loose spots where steam can escape i always add my vegetables a little over halfway through the cooking process  ive found that the directions that aroma provided while quite awesome and i reference them frequently for cooking times  a really great instructional pamphlet to be a little too long to steam vegetables trial and error you will find your preference ive havent tried to steam meat yet  that may be an adventure down the roadin regards to cooking brown rice remember that brown rice has a different texture than white rice if youve never had it before its a tiny bit chewier the directions in aromas pamphlet that reference the water lines only refer to white rice  but they have included directions for brown rice i always use the provided measuring cup to measure  never continental measuring cups because ive always figured that theyve done all the work for me in figuring out what is most suitable i usually do have to cook it more on the longer end of the spectrum when it references times in the bookletbasically  if youre thinking about getting a rice cooker i would recommend this one its not too advanced and its fun to play around with particularly for a person who lives alone or in a relationship i think you may need a larger rice cooker if youre looking for something for a larger family i hope you enjoy it as much as i do i look forward to trying to make nonrice items too like soups the little rice cooker that could"
396,1,barely used once and its stuck at a welcome screen sometimes even a black screen when powered on waste of moneystopped working after just testing it out
1796,2,i ordered this as very good and it stopped working several times throughout my party most of the photos came out very dark almost entirely black i ended up returning it which was a shamewouldnt recommend getting this used
7158,1,i bought mine last year it worked fine at the beginning one time i wanted to print something and it didnt work we tried to repair the item and it didnt work and this a month after i bought it at the end the printer didnt even connect to bluetooth anymore and when i wrote an email to customer service they told me the printer wasnt going to work anymore and that it has no repair very badit doesnt work
9296,4,not totally nonstick soaking required before washingnonstick not quite
5055,2,i purchased this camera for a gift to be used with the adventure challenge book i took  photos before wrapping up the gifts to make sure that the camera worked and they looked great then it took my partner and i a few weeks to plan our date night using the book and the camera no longer took a photo the front light was flashing orange and amazon customer service couldnt help me and forwarded me to the seller the seller said i had to contact the manufacturer and the manufacturer has been no help and i have to pay for shipping to get the camera replaced i would have been better off buying a disposable camera or printing photos from my phone to cvs photobroken after using twice
7589,2,i purchased these to photograph some items to sell on ebay the usb cords are short and the stands are so lightweight that any tug on the cord or small bump and they are falling over you get what you pay for obviously the lighting wasnt that bright either even for small spaces if you are thinking about a setup go at least  tier highertoo light stands fall over with the slightest touch
7666,1,paid  for only film absolutely ridiculouscame with only film no camera cant even ahold of anyone
2603,1,initially only developed every third or fourth picture wasting most of the film eventually stopped developing pictures at all luckily i had one day left in the return window a piece of junkdont waste your money
4603,1,horrible quality half the items were either broken or didnt even work correctlycheaply made
3570,1,this thing is getting too hot when using high frame rate the app for smart phone is glitchyi mean when some body design such options then it should be workable and reliable  
6244,2,its a bit cumbersome once on the camera i used it for the first time this week and i ended up getting frustrated with it and taking it off great concept just a little to bulky for what i would likenot as easy as it appears
4906,1, this camera will not work unless you purchase separately a memory  i ordered the yellow version the box that came was yellow the camera that was inside was bluewill not work wihout additional purchase
7456,2,i really wanted to keep this camera however it will not hold the date or time once it is turned off the  video is definitely upscaled the pictures are lowmedium but not up to par with  we were simply using it for our ebike rides to record our rides its just like being on a motorcycle some people just dont see you and pull right out in front of you and tons of other stuff we needed some way to show video if it was ever needed thats why we wanted to keep this camera but because it wont keep the date or time it will not work properly for us we could not update the firmware on the camera so the camera just didnt work as described i actually own the akaso brave  and i have no issues with it even though it also upscales the video to  i believe it is upscaled from  there are tvs that do the same thing the video on these cameras are equivalent to  at best but they were good enough for our purposes of recording our rides there are plenty of videos out there on these cameras showing the video differences if you have image stabilization turned on it reduces the screen size tremendously if your looking for a cheap action camera to do outdoor good lighting shots and not expecting great quality this might work for you if they fix the date and time issue most of these cameras are utterly identical on the insides with a different brand stamped on the outside this camera comes with plenty of attachments for most beginners with action cameras i did not test the under water case so i cant review on that the microphone is actually decent it did pick up the vibration from the tires on our ebikes but when were just using it in the wide open it worked good another small downside is it doesnt support usbc usbc is becoming the new standard on cell phones so why do these manufacturers keep using old technology maybe cheaper or they have an abundance of old usb micro connections my akaso brave  camera has the usbc on the camera but they left the remote as the old usbb micro  however the  isnt a horrible camera for its price and will definitely be good enough for the beginner in action cameraswont hold date or time
6014,2,had trouble focusing with zoomtook  pictures and the battery diedbad battery life
1050,1,i purchased this because my cousin wanted a camera it weighed like nothing we charged it and was not working properly when it was connected to the electricity it worked but the quality of pictures wasnt the best i ended up returning itnot the greatest
613,1,we got this for a cruise so we could leave our phones in the room the pictures were terrible quality and it was hard to use buttons are small and close together might be a good camera for a small childsent back
7655,1,was fine until suddenly stop working not the batteries not the films i cant figure out so i will return itnot the best product
7724,1,i ordered two for my kids i was surprised to see so many good reviews and i was expected something else the picture quality is very bedbut i was happy to return both at no cost im not really sure how accurate are all the reviews on amazon bad picture quality
8962,1,not the quality of images and couldnt get it to connect with wifipoor quality images
16784,5,great sleek rice cooker for reasonable pricecooks perfectly no burned rice
5162,1,i would not recommend videos are grainy and not clear at all picture quality is just okto be honest my cell phone camera is better i wish i had returned it before the  days expireddont buy for videos
7608,1,cant even see the lights from the warehouse think they have to ship it to you idknot bright enough to light up anything over long distances
903,1,usb cable faulty would not charge bought new one which worked too pictures and video only pictures would show up on computer not the video which would play in the camara tried to play on tv hdmi cable faulty so had enough returned item but cost me  all in all it cost me money will not buy from amazon again unless i get free returnsbought this item in good faith
5917,1,this was my second kodak camera product excluding film and i was once again very dissatisfied quality of the camera was in line with a happy meal prize and the image quality was just awful returned it and so glad i did bought a similar printer solution that works with a smartphone app much better quality  pictures and can do so much more on a smartphone camera look elsewhere for a neat instant picture solution youll be happiervery disappointed at how poor the quality was and awful picture images
9464,5,if you want to get a rice cooker make sure it is this one it is extremely easy to cook rice with this just push the button down and it will cook it automatically you dont have to worry about settings or anything this rice cooker knows the time required to cook for any amount of rice you put in best rice cooker out there
17737,5,"this rice cooker does exactly what it was made for it cooks rice really well and the little tune it plays when it finishes is adorable however if you are looking to cook rice quickly or if youre looking to cook a lot of rice at one time this is not the product for you if you dont mind waiting around an hour for some of the best cooked rice at home and you only want to make at max  measuring cups of rice at a time this little machine is perfect for that i have to put measuring cups as the cup it comes with is a bit less than  cupive owned this particular rice cooker for a little over half a year now and it has held up to weekly use just fine i usually use it for short grain rice as well as long grain white rice so i cant speak much to the brown and gaba features of the unit but for what i use it for its perfect i havent had any issues in consistency or any mechanical issues thus far as long as you follow the directions for how much water to add and you wash your rice you will get consistent results out of itpros it does exactly what it was meant to doperfect for small families or single person useyou can set it and forget it when you start cooking a meal and it will be done before you finish cookingthe tune it plays is adorablecons it takes an hour to cook so if you dont have that long you would want to get a different rice cookerit only has a  measuring cup maximum uncooked on the ricedoes exactly what its made for but"
2040,1,it is a great gift idea first the instructions are wrong the camera must be charged up before installing the first film no charging cable or charger si provided i was lucky and did notice it did not come with film ok those are minor issues but second big issue after charging and installing the film the film cover did to eject watched youtube videos it is supposed to eject automatically  ok maybe a problem with this film it is  nope did not eject looks like this is uselesscomplete failuer
17350,5,ive been using this daily for nearly  months now it really is the best rice cooker ive ever used but i also have never owned a rice cooker more than  before the rice is perfectly made every single time you can tell the cooker to make soft regular or harder rice and you truly can tell a difference on each setting ive only ever cooked white basmati rice so im definitely not getting all i can out of this rice cooker because it does so much more and has mode specific settings for many different types of rice one of my favorite features is the keep warm setting im often busy working and dont have time between lunch break and dinner time to start cleaning and prepping the rice but with this setting i can just make the rice during breakfast or lunch and it sits perfectly in the cooker for up to  hours it tastes the same after  hours vs just finishing  minutes ago the biggest downside for many would be the cooking time on average it takes around  minutes to cook  cups of white steamed rice you definitely cant forget about your rice and expect it to be done in  minutes lastly cleanup its incredible the nonstick pain is truly nonstick and ive never had rice get stuck in the cooker before ever ive never had to scrub the bottom of the cooker trying to get burnt rice off the bottom of the pan it never sticks you can literally just gently hand wash this rice cooker with warm water after every use and get it completely clean this rice cooker is worth the pricebest rice cooker ive ever owned
959,1,so i was intending for it to be my new stream cam and as i screwed it in it literally broke at the seam so not sure if i just got a bad seal on the seam if its just a flaw in the model but be forewarned i have had nothing but issues with the camera senseit broke via tripod
2262,2,the camera will turn on once or twice the begin to not turn on for a long time even after charging all day i dont know why maybe it is just mine the quality is great otherwisecamera often does not turn in
7869,1,i was very excited to purchase this printer but unfortunately the bluetooth does not stay connected to my phone it only printed two pictures when i first connected it then when i tried to reconnect in another time to print more it no longer connected to my phone at first i thought it was my phone but my phone still connected to everything else that was bluetooth i really wanted this printer to work out but unfortunately i will be returning itwill be returning
9107,1,who doesnt love polaroid i grew up in a family that had one of the original cameras that took the  film at one point it was impossible to find or had to be specially orderedfast forward and im actually disappointed in the quality of the i type film this particular pack must have been damaged in production or shipping because all of the film had weird tiger like teeth marks in a horizontal directioni used this film with the polaroid photo lab and the quality isnt that great at all you might achieve better results with one of the new polaroid cameras vs printing after the factnot worth it
9532,5,i use this rice cooker almost every day you can cook a lot of things in it not just rice love it i use it for beans sauces  soups too
6954,2,i bought two of these cameras and both of them broke way too easily i had a case for the first one babied it never dropped it nothing there was some common malfunction where the shutter got stuck and was irreparable i loved the pictures that it took so much that i just bought another one lo and behold that one also broke a bummer because the photos really are so great but the product shouldnt break just from a gust of breath hitting itway too fragile but takes great photos
7345,2,i have struggled with this product for  months the image projected is too small for any use i am going back to free hand drawing i thought this would shortened my time sketching an object before painting but the size of the image is too small to be of use i feel i wasted my money on this product the praise is great in the ads but it doesnt function as statedsave your money
5070,1,sent usedopen dirty filthy fingerprints and packages ripped open for the memory card too and to top it off it doesnt even work and who ever had this camera must have been holding a slice of pizza beside they handled it grosshorrible
7905,1,it only printed  pictures in the first month i bought it until the film started to get stuck now it wont print at all my order was june  of money
10677,4,love ot fast and easy but just a little messy you have to open the lid a little bit to let the heat out or i will definitely make a mess all overawesome and easy
8651,1,bought this for my daughter to bring to summer camp the camera froze after every picture resulting in her having to take the batteries out to restart it therefore many memories that she wanted to capture with photos were lost the scrapbook we were going to make after camp cannot be done now since theres barely any photos i cannot emphasize how disappointed we all are i thought since it was polaroid it would be reliable but i have learned my lesson i will never buy any polaroid brand again save your money and buy from a brand thats more reliable i will be returning thisbuyer beware
6764,1,does not work for the dragon instant print camera 
4033,2,updated three of my cameras have suddenly gone offline i am leaving for a trip the day after tomorrow and need the system to work i got one camera back up by changing the batteries and resynching it with the base station note i got no warning email that the batteries were low which i usually do so far that hasnt worked with the  and i havent tried the  i have tried all the troubleshooting on their site i am not a free user i am a paying customer but all of the support links only take you to forums and faqs there is no link to call or email tech support this is unacceptable when i am a paying customerive had my first cameras up for about  days and mounted the last camera todayunlike some other reviewers thus far ive had no hardware issues all the cameras i have  synced perfectly to the base unit setup was super easythe good the picture is pretty good the remote access works really nicely i use the android app and i do find i have to close all windows in task manager even after ive logged out before i can use it again the night vision is good and the range is pretty good im not sure the distance but the camera farthest from the base station is at the end of my garage and theres the garage a decentsized bedroom and my living room between the camera and the base unit and the camera works fine they are dead simple to mount even for someone whose drill skills are limited and including the extra mounts for the exterior camerasthe bad the recording by motion detection leaves a lot to be desired i get a lot of recordings of nothing i think sometimes the motion sensor is triggered by motion that is outside of the recording area of the camera other times the delay before recording actually begins mentioned by other reviewers is the culprit at the same time things that one would think would be captured like humans walking in through the front door are often though not always missed i have not done any troubleshooting on this based on the numerous reviews and forum posts about this issue plus the fact that it is happening on all my cameras i just dont think it has anything to do with the location of the cameras or whether they are properly synced i think it is a limitation of the systemstill unknown battery life the first camera i put up is already showing a reduction in battery bars but it has undergone a lot of testing and is a high traffic area im now using the default of  sensitivity and  second recordings if need be i can put the q camera with a power cord in that location although i wouldnt love the look of a power cord in my entryway you cant use the q outdoors thoughif your main concern is making sure you get a really good picture of the perp if someone breaks into your house or steals from your property you will probably be disappointed in this system for me it is worthwhile despite that flaw because  really your only alternative if you want multiple cameras and continuous recording is wired cameras that need to be both wired for electricity and connected to your dvr by wires then if you want remote access your dvr needs to be wired by ethernet cable to your router for me this would require hiring someone to do substantial work  i look at a lot of security videos in the course of my work a lot of them are not much help a criminal is not going to stand there in front of your camera they are going to be moving fast and may well be taking steps to obscure their vehicle plates or their faces  at least if you do catch an image of the perp it will be uploaded to the cloud unless the criminal can also hack into your account they arent going to be able to delete the images whereas a savvy criminal will locate and take or destroy your dvr  it is still useful to look in on how pets petsitters elderly family members etc are doing or to see whats going on if i get a text that my alarm has been triggeredthere is a usb port on the base station for further expansion if they would add the capability to record to an attached storage drive that would really make the system even more competitive with a dvr systemgreat but not perfect  updated no customer service
6508,2,the battery life is terrible wont last more than  minutes on a full charge and it cant be used while charging too badbattery doesnt last
14485,4,its size is good enough for those who lives by themselves but it also cooks rice for  and  people i have  because on the day i got it one of its bottom holders brokefine
14725,5,"i did a bit of research before buying this rice cooker and im glad i purchased this one it was highly rated and i find it is very versatile ive only had it a short while but ive made regular white rice oatmeal polenta quinoa and sticky rice a bit different than regular rice but im finding i like it better it has a different consistency and taste everything ive made turned out great the first time i did go online and found a number of recipesinstructions on how to make things in a rice cooker and they turned out wellthe only thing that i found problematic were the instructions they are a bit confusing thats why i went online for all the different recipes im finding that ive only scratched the surface of what this rice cooker can doi do clean the insides after each use and its not very difficult the instructions say not cleaning it out can affect the taste of whatever you make next lastly be sure to wipe out the inner seal on the bottom of the cover because it collects wateri really like this rice cooker because it is well made and i think it will last a long time with heavy usage it has a lot of bang for the buck i highly recommendvery versatile"
1165,1,they gave me a camera that was defective and was jammed but at your own risk this is not a reliable vendor would not recommend to buy from this company againworst camera ever
6219,2,delivered as promised finally opened and used today february  canvas material is good and i like the drawstrings the clear plastic is cheap took it out in cold weather and was very stiff to the point where if you fold it it has the potential of cracking or tearing this is likely made for warmer weather and primarily for rain it does the job in keeping my equipment dry including the lens but this model is actually made for a shorter lengths of less than  mmgood thing this cheap
7302,2,disappointingthats my feeling buying this camera the images are ok arrived in time the case works properly however the camera works almost perfectly if not for the wifi that does not work at alleven trying to update software firmware and all that bulshit wifi doesnt work at alldisappointing thats my feeling buying this camera the images 
7165,2,after installing this on to my camera i found that if i adjusted the straps to fit snugly around my hand id be unable to comfortably reach the shutter button if the straps were too loose it felt like it could slide off my hand and i could drop my cameraunable to comfortably reach the shutter button
4355,1,i wouldnt waste your moneypoor quality

13734,5,after going through two cheaper rice cookers i just decided to spend the money on one that would last super simple no features but will last foreverbifl rice cooker
15850,5,my new rice cooker has a small footprint which i find takes up very little space on my countertop which i like this cooker is easy to set up and use immediately out of the box and cooks excellent rice with no issues thus rice cooker has a beautiful stainless steel design which i find goes very well with my other stainless steel appliances overall this is a great little rice cooker and i highly recommend itsmall footprint easy to use beautiful looking
10405,4,i got this for a coworker as a christmas gift because they said they wanted a rice cooker they cant stop raving about it and they dont know why they have gone so long without one perfect rice every time and easy to useyes

26,4,they seem to work fine they are a little bit sensitive to phone placement i havent evaluated the charging speed as i use this overnight so speed is not critical hopefully they are durable and last a whileworks
8765,1,im usually not one to put bad reviews i caught this camera for my sisters wedding as a bridal gift and it didnt take anywhere near good quality pictures it came with colored  film well it came out black and white on all the pictures we took i looked up and saw that most of the reviews have the same problem with this camera so my sister is now having to return her present  the polaroid and i just got her an instax camera instead and she loves it and even took it to her wedding and honeymoon save your money and dont get this camerajust get an instax instead
7063,1, i had like this package deal and purchased it and shipped it down to trinidad for my niece she open this on december   for her birthday and that is how the camera was loading only lines coming up i am living in new jersey i couldnt get a refund so i lost out on  us dollar plus i also pay to clear this item in trinidad this was stressful i am not buying anything and ship it worldwide againwasnt a good purchase

4815,1,the package was complete and the accessories were cute but the camera came faulty would only light up on the first setting and flash did not activate and when i went through the process of sending it all back my refund stayed processing for over a week not easy to get ahold of customer service supposedly the refund takes maximum  days and it has already been two weeks i am starting to fear i will not get my money back my advice go with another sellergot a faulty product then had to hassle for my refund
3371,1,you surely get what u pay for with this cheap camerathe viewfinder was terrible and the photos were lousywill never spend less on a digital again everworst camera i ever purchased
4122,2,i can tell you i really like this product at first it gives very clear pictures and is nice to have a security around the house one thing that is sort of a bummer is the delay in recording cars drive down my alley and it only records the last little bit of them if people walked in my yard it does record them pretty well and the quality of the video is good i want to explain why im only giving it to starsafter about a month and  yes after the warranty is out  the unit started going offline all the time none of my other devices in my home are going offline at all i also am very familiar with computers routers end modems i have logged into my modem and looked to see if the modem goes offline when this is happening it is not the unit is now going offline all the time and the cameras are not recording because they are not connected to the unit because it is offline this is very frustrating for this expensive of the system i now wish dearly that i could return the unit for full refundnetgear has a lot to do before this is ready to sell to the public it is very buggy and it times does not work at all anymore it always has been buggy even when i first purchased it but at least it work then pretty dissatisfied and definitely would not buy again instead of having a product to protect my home i have a  system that just sits therei want to note as well that i have worked with netgear for one camera that had broke already and they did replace it free of charge however i dont want to have to work with netgear every week to have this working which is what has ended up happeningwas great at first but not anymore
6600,1,it just didnt take the quality photos line outr other cam  i was really shocked at all the great reviewswe were told it was a good cam compared to our canon rebel it gets a o 
5283,1,the camera body is fine but the description is inaccurate if you read the complete description it says the  lens is a vr lens this is not correct both lenses are basic nonvr lenses i am returning productfalse description
454,1,camera didnt work out of the box lcd does not display in spite of all effortslcd does not power on
1523,1,camera would not turn on had to returnhad to return
6434,1,we went scuba diving we bought  of them one was water proof and one was not the screen is not visible under water so you have no idea what your doing i thought i was capturing photos when i was turning the video off and on id spend the extra money and get better camerasnot water proof
8898,2,very poor picture quality and the adjustments are ridiculous if you want to spend your time deleting badly lit photos and thumbing through a manual to try and continuously reset lighting and focus area then this is the camera to buy just use your i phone because this one offers no advantage and is harder to down load or delete minolta and amazon should have pulled this one from their line long agovery disappointed
14889,5,i got this for my boyfriend and his mom fell in love with it because it cooks rice so fast makes a lot of rice only thing i would say is after it cooks unplug and instead of leaving it on warm because it will get a little hard at the bottom if left on warm for a whilemakes a lot of rice
6162,1,the camera came doa it wouldnt start updoa
8322,1,play video i purchased this a week ago and it just arrived today  the sd card is in however its saying it isnt and wont allow my  year old to take any pictures disappointed
14102,4,needs improved directions doesnt tell you when is done cooking or has switched to warming function will continue to try it for now but may purchase nicer one in future does what its supposed to do for the price  size i wantedits ok for the price
618,1,we got this for our daughter for christmas the camera does not work at all maybe i got a defective one but its super frustrating trying to set up something she has been wanting and it keeps saying card error and the screen freezes tried restarting it and charging it and the same thing happened except this time their were no words just half the screen was blue and twitching ridiculousthis camera is trash
9378,5,i was nervous to use this im used to cooking everything in the oven it works well and pretty easy to useeasy to use and clean
2122,1,i would give this a negative  star review if i could it is terrible camera quality if you are of darker skin tone i took  pictures and in every picture i took i was not able to see my self or my friend i found it very offensive please make your camera more inclusive and be able to take flash offnot for all skin tones
970,1,the quality is very poor the videos come out blurrywill not purchase or recommend
5726,1,i got this paper hoping to extend my use of my of the little fuji polaroid instead it either does not print or prints out several sheets with no photo very disappointed returningdoes not work with fuji polaroid camera
512,1,i am so disappointed this worked for about  minutes then the screen froze and the lens would not go back in it was a huge let down i am not happy about this experienceso discouraged this was a huge disappointment
4381,2,this is extremely difficult and frustrating to use the picture quality is great but its difficult and not user friendly when it comes to adding pictures  videos and navigating i get so frustrated every time i try to add images that i wish i had never purchased this product if it wasnt too late id return it i recently thought of giving this to someone as a gift and buying a different brand for myself but why would i inflict this on a loved one dont recommendgreat picture quality too difficult to use
7753,2,did not use item appeared cheap an childishreturned
2473,2,dont expect anything special camera phones are bettercheap
3115,1,disappointed with this film film is already expensive and for the film to come out with this brown at the top of film happened twicebad film
6155,1,i sent it back because it was cheaply made and the quality was terrible i used to teach photography and i wouldnt buy it for my  yr old grandson terrible product
7424,2,so i have had issues with this camera the first time i used the camera it flashed and took a picture made some noise but never produced a photo so after a few minutes and reading the manual i removed the batteries as suggested and reinstalled with the camera on it didnt do anything so i again took another photo but nothing happened this time i removed the batteries and left them out for a few minutes before putting them back in this time the camera took another photo and did eject the picture the picture was messed up i assume due to being exposed  times and the film counter was already at  despite only ejecting one photo i couldnt find any way to reset the counter to  which is the proper number nor could i find information about if it will continue past  on the counter if there is actually film left or if my other  photos are just lost i did contact support but never got an answer and it has been over a weekissues with camera
5818,2,i love this camera and its amazing zoom but it seems like everything i order from amazon is defective anymore the camera does not show the battery life discharging it goes from full battery life to suddenly the charge battery warning every time very inconvenient i dont know if anyone else has this problem but i ordered a second camera as a gift and it also does this and the batteries die very quickly toodefective doesnt show battery life
8405,2,the pack of borders you can decorate your pictures with are entirely too large and pretty much useless pretty sad about it because theyre so cuteadhesive borders are too large for the size of the photos
8410,1,all of the photos came out with lines across horrible quality youre better off buying canon paperall of the photos came out with lines across
9118,1,i ordered a film for my camera as i was taking pictures the film kept coming out uneven i thought my camera was broken and the rollers were dirty until i checked the date the films expired  film
6488,1,i would agree with most of the positive reviews of this light with one important exception i had originally purchased two of them but after a few months one simply started turning itself off after  minutes because i really liked them i purchased a third for back up but again after a few months it also started turning itself off the lights show a complete charge and can be turned back on the two that malfunction though will then turn themselves off again after what seems a random amount of time there is no help from the sellers website and they havent replied to a message about this problem so if you have one that works these are great and inexpensive light source if you dont then they are uselessgreat light until it shuts itself off
13349,1," do not buy the vent is directly above the plug and as the rice cooks water splashes all over the place the top of the lid fills up it splashes all over the counter and worse it drips water down directly onto the plug half the time it trips the gfci outlet in the kitchen just today i got a bit of a zap by touching the cord you can see in the picture that there is water pooling on top of the power cable do not buy this producthorrible design risk of electric shock"
8713,1,downgraded from  stars to  star because the seller got my email from some chinese spam company and now sends my emails twice a week to remove my review for a gift cardthe resolution is amazing in bright light but poor in medium to low lighting situations sound quality is good clips only record for  minutes maximum which is much too short for anyone looking to capture incriminating evidence throughout the course of a daythe battery charges quickly but i suspect it is due to lower than rated capacity weve never been able to get more than half an hour of video from the peni would pay more for a device that can record longer  minute limit on clips
2704,2,overall my  old really enjoyed snapping pictures with this camera but after  months the camera stopped charging and we were unable to fix it im going to contact the vendor to see if they can offer any assistance with the repairstopped charging after  months
1458,1,horrible quality also be careful because they charge you twice for the product bad camera
17304,5,i used this every day to make oatmeal or muesli i set it up before heading to the gym and when i get back i have a nice hot breakfast waiting for me i also use this to make white brown and wild rice and it all comes out perfectgreat little cooker
6109,1,would not buy again broke after only a few monthsbroke after a few months
14272,5,my wife loves it cooks rice which is a plus you can also cook other things with it if desired and has given us  issuesit cooks rice
911,2,its not a bad camera for the price i am returning it and purchasing a video camera from best buy it advertises that it is touchscreen but its notno touchscreen
1447,2,got this camera for my young daughter afterless than a week the battery door broke the picture quality isnt great but it is a cheap cameradisappointing and fragile
3871,2,i purchased my camera used kit body and lens only recieved the camera no lens no battery and many other accessories missing highly disappointed because now i have to spend upward of  on a new lensebe careful buying from amazon warehouse
3542,2,the video is first rate the operation is simple enough the camera is virtually useless for my purposes i mounted it above a pool table in an air conditioned room and it wont run fifteen minutes without overheatingoverheats in an air conditioned room
6174,2,i used this rain cover on my  month old canon  that cost  i was standing in light rain for about  hours and i noticed condensation appearing on the inside of the cover the rain was not getting in it was just condensation when i got home i took the camera out of the bag and it was noticeably wet all over i dried it out but now the camera does not work its been sitting in a bag of rice for  hours and now the camera only partially works i cannot recommend this rain cover the condensation has killed my brand new cameracondensation build up has ruined a  camera
1170,1,cant open the battery door so i cant even use the camera support didnt have a fixstuck battery door
8936,1,after installing memory cardinstalling the battery the camera would not function i called tech support and was unable to talk to a technician i returned the productno support
617,1,im returning this camera because the flash is so weak i tried to take about  indoor pictures with the flash on with lights on in the room and they were so dark and grainy id say this was definitely for use outside in bright sunlightthe flash is so weak better used outdoors in bright sunlight
11137,4,"absolutely love this little kitchen marvel firsttime owner of a rice cooker where has this been all my lifeperfect for whipping up a an order of rice for two to four people white or brown its done perfectly great for quinoa too my only complaint is that once its done cooking if you let it sit too long before you fluff the rice begins to brown on the very bottom i asked around and this is typical for these little rice cookers i troubleshot this issue by immediately unplugging and pulling out the pot insert and placing it on the stove or on a hot pad overall would recommenddoesnt make a bad batch of rice"
6368,2,nice look but the view is not what the box is saying at all i feel ripped off frl frllow budget camera
1176,1,better off using your iphone for sureterrible video quality
441,2,i was looking for a camera to use in the outdoors for both stills and video but when recording video you can only monitor it on the lcd screen and the eyepiece is disabled so it is pretty much useless during a sunny day to record video i knew it was a bad omen when the ups driver got rude with me when i asked him why he wasnt wearing a mask i really wish i had not purchased this camera and waited until i could afford a better one if you dont plan on recording video outdoors maybe this isnt a big deal for you but any enthusiasm i had for this camera is gone and i will probably replace it as soon as i can and give this one away it seemed like a sweet deal but it was too good to be truecant see anything on the lcd screen when recording video in bright sunlight
1008,2,not worth the price extremely basic camera with no ability to focus on the itemperson being photographed we tried taking photos of items  feet away unfortunately the items were very blurry only works if youre taking photos from at least  feet away but even then the quality could be better we are returning and getting a higher quality camera that can actually focus on the subject being photographed two stars for the following one for ease of use another for the fact that it does indeed take pictures even if with poor qualitynot the best camera
13956,5,"very easy to use and clean white rice cooks in  minutes brown rice and other grains need  minutesthe end product is delicious much much better than saucepan rice try throwing in some dried herbs de provance ground garlic and salt with your water before steaming  its cheap easy and riceariffic"
1293,1,camera wont turn in unless its plugged in and it says the memory card is fullwaste of money
15469,5, i love it its so easy to use cooks perfect rice steams beautifully comes with steaming basket two little spoons this is a real review go and look for a discounted one on the post i got one that had a dented box i was shocked that it was barley dented it was brand new i got it cheap i got it for  take advantage of dented boxes from the factory it was fine you can cook all kinds of different things with it but it youll love it i took a picture so you could see the size of it its not too big at all i absolutely love itamazing
500,2,took good pictures and videos for  weeks then would not work gave error message over and over again turn camera off and on again never would take another picture returned for refundcamera quit working
1819,1,the quality of the photos this camera produces are obnoxiously bad i mean really bad super  outta  do not recommend not even for a child to play with this must be the camera that was used to take every single big foot photo in existencea polaroid camera from  has better quality photos
13970,2,unfortunately this rice cooker didnt do a great job for me i usually cook either jasmine rice or basmati rice and while the jasmine rice cooked alright not as good as my previous zojirushi which didnt have the induction feature the basmati rice came out borderline inedible you might be able to get better results by ignoring the recommended water amounts and finding what works best for basmati  long grain rice but i dont always cook the same amount of rice and so i need a consistent way to measure the water and get good results a long grain setting is sorely needed here lastly the time display on this unit is in military time and it is not possible to change this all in all i am returning this one as i dont feel that it meets the advertised abilitieswasnt as good as previous rice cookers
305,2,ill be honest i regret buying this cameratwo stars
4667,2,very spotty performance and practically no technical supportvery limited support
4218,2,this canera has impossible settingsnot a vlogging camera and i paid eighty seven dollars for it to be thrown in the ground and it make me look like a red pop ato and im blackworst
7078,1,my camera doesnt turn ondissatisfied
4458,1,orderered this frame due to all the supposedly good reviews just received the frame powered it up and inserted an sd card with pictures on it frame worked well for about   hours then all of a sudden it just died i moved the power supply to a different outlet even though i know the outlet was working because a lamp was working from the same outlet frame still would not power up from the second and then a third outlet cycled the power switch several times and unpluggedreplugged in the power connector several times toono joyso while this thing wasnt doa it had a much shorter working lifespan than a mayfly much less than  hours this was supposed to be a gift given at a good friends retirement ceremony tonight but i guess ill just be saying something nice now unbelievabledigital frame had a shorter lifespan than a mayfly
1171,1,only used this twice  the charger is broke already cheap qualitybroken charger
7660,1,bought this for my wedding to capture for guest book and throughout the night half the time it would not workunreliable
3572,1,by far the worst camera ive ever purchased gopros videos convinced me to buy it but in reality its super buggy overheats and the software is not user friendly i bought the hero  thinking it was going to be easy to use specifically for someone like myself who doesnt have a ton of experience recording with traditional camerasive been seeing ads for a new  camera from  which looks promising for first time action camera users their app looks pretty user friendly i might get that instead and return this hero  camera ive ever bought
14027,5,i bought this because my old rice cooker was put through the ringer while living with roommates they put the rice cooker pot directly on the stove and used metal utensils on the nonstick coating i was struggling to choose a rice cooker with the same functions and cooking capacity and chose this one it doesnt steam but thats fine since its really nice for its main function which is cooking rice it says you can do other things but i mainly only cook rice it came with a ha dy rice cup and  utensils rice paddle and a soup spoon i suggest buying this for  person households or smaller since it only a  cup capacity a great find and easy to cleaneasy to use a good rice cooker
6063,1,terrible quality not water proofcrap
9494,5,this cooker was just what i neededjust the right size
4714,2,i gifted this camera for my  year old for christmas and she really loves it because its a camera and it looks cool and because its an overall gadget kids her age loves gadgets even if it is a crappy quality well that is the case for this camera very very cheaply made the picture quality is cheap and all the photos look like i submitted a photo from back in the early  lol the video quality is just as bad and doesnt work very well at all my daughter let me know that it keeps stopping it doesnt play what she records were unable to delete pictures and videos even though it says so and we tried we are getting ready to return this camera and get a refund and hopefully get a camera with better pic and video quality dont waste your money on this camera its nice overall and that it prints out pics on spot but the quality overall is not worth it for my  year old i couldve gotten her a regular digital camera but i wanted something super cute and kiddie dont waste your money ive seen better instant print cameras from other kids my daughter knowsthe quality of this camera is garbage
14859,5,i really dont like the thought of eating teflon with my food this has no teflon coating and yet is fairly easy to clean use it a couple of times a week to fix rice for my wife and the chickensno teflon

4679,1,i chose it because of metal body which normally dissipates heat faster but the heat it generates during constant writing at  even not the highest  writing speed causes the sdxc card disconnected and data loss frequently not usable at alloverheat causes data loss
7639,1,i got this as a present for my niece but unfortunately it was broken it wouldnt spit out photos unless you turned it off and turned it back on and the photos all came out completely ruined amazon wouldnt let me exchange it at first and wanted me to pay more money than i originally paid to get a replacementitem arrived broken
4683,1,not recommended this product is highly unreliable after four months it no longer recognizes sd cards i contacted the vendor and they refused to replace it or refund me directlyunreliable broke after  months
2840,1,for kids or seniors get a decent camera for the same price sent backtoo much money for cheap product sent back
4687,1,unable to usenot what i wanted
1128,1,not close to  and yes i removed the protective film and adjusted the video settings to  the output on this camera is significantly worse than anything i have ever used the videos are grainy and jittery any movement of the camera or subject causes distortion in the video and the autofocus keeps flickering every time the subject blinks the pictures are decent but for filming and streaming this camera is worthless i dont understand the positive reviews as i get better quality out of an old camera with an svideo output than thisclarity horriblecolor horribleauto focus horriblestreaming horriblecheap toy at best
5028,1,my daughter was so excited to receive this for her first communion from her grandparents however when trying to take photos they all came out overexposed and the flash takes forever to charge back up she had to only take one photo and wait hours to take another one this was such a huge disappointment we are going to start the return processvery disappointed little girl
8369,2,does this film work with the kodak camerayesbut let me spare you the time the quality of picture that comes from this camera and film combo is horrible buy literally any other camerathe pictures come out fuzzy  times and that small  you get a decent picture it is still grainy and low res if you want a camera that takes quick and good quality photos go with a polaroidthe film is bad and the camera is bad
4843,1,i was supposed to get  films and i only got  films thats not right i paid alot of money for this camera and for u guys to give me the wrong one please help me my daughter is really upset thats so wrong
8524,2,it worked great for  months and stopped it was the best gift my daughter received for her graduation and it was what she wanted unfortunately it stopped producing the pictures i had every intention on sending it back but unfortunately ended up in the hospital and had been collecting dust what can i do she hasnt been able to use it and i have unused photo cartridges i purchased i would like to get another if possibleit worked great for  months and stopped
14768,5,this is most definitely an ideal rice cooker great value if you are looking for a simple turn it on and off cook and keep it warm this is itideal simple rice cooker
5350,1,had to get a new one broke the first dayok
2843,1,dead within a week returned it to amazon and bought a different branddead within a week
2047,2,such a let down i was really expecting more from polaroid but i guess you get what you pay for and this was kind of cheap so there you have it a simple camera that performs simple tasks not worth the price tag if you ask menot worth price tag
941,1,i wanted to use this video camera to record classes for use online but the quality of the video is awful grainy noisy picture worse than the minivhs tapes we had in the  id do better getting that camera down and converting everything to a digital format sound quality was subpar and the zoom function was not smooth at all not to mention the hand stabilizer that actually made the picture less stable causing more bounce and shake than if i was just holding the camera in my handin which the hand strap was also not adjustable to fit a smaller hand size what ive come to realize in hoping that technology had finally become reasonably priced is that it has not in order to accomplish what i need im going to have to spend at least  to get the proper quality a digital camcorder should haveworse than my  camcorder
14251,5,"this cooker works like a charm rice is perfect and amazing every time never sticks no burned bottom the key to nonstick rice is to rinse your rice if you like that crusty bottom dont rinseread the instructions they are key to having an excellent experience with your cookerwhite rice use the included cup fill to brim and add to pot when youve added a number of scoops fill water to the line with the corresponding number in the pot ie if you use  scoops fill with water to the  line press the white rice button and start  minutes later perfect rice easycan set a timer to start the rice later if you wish and it will keep the rice warm and fresh for  hours before autoshutoff ive never been one to keep rice warm like this as all my other rice cookers have been cheap garbage this is the best feature rice with breakfast sure then itll be waiting at lunch and again at dinner so much loveif youre worried about your rice bubbling over and out the lid make sure youre not using too much rice or water make sure your settings are correct and the best way to prevent bubbleover keep the steamer basket in when cooking even if empty this breaks down the bubbles and itll never boil over winanother great feature the power cord appliances always always always come with tiny cords tiny i hate them but this one comes with a tiny cord but its the same kind of power cable connector that my computers and monitors do which means i have  long replacement cables mwahahaha this is not recommended by company so i dont know if this will affect quality of cooker  use this method at own risk i dont have children or pets to knock my cooker down so im not worried about the extra cable this way i dont have everything packed together on my counter because everything has  cables if youre looking for a great cooker this is it i love this so much it even makes a little tune when you start it reminds me of the tune from old zelda games when you get an item possibly my most favorite feature everbest rice cooker ive ever owned"

14732,5,"years ago purchased a rice cooker crockpot and it was no better than a saucepan ive been researching rice cookers for a while and saw a lot of the more expensive ones for resale on ebay the feedback sold me on this one and the price was reasonablenote the measuring cup isnt  oz instead of measuring rice to water ratio learned from a japanese chef always rinse rice until the water runs clear after placing rice in pot cover with water up to first index finger knuckle above rice this method worked very well in the cuckoostop searching rice cookersbuy a cuckoo"
9484,5,i purchased this for my husband and hes loving it the brand is awesome so far its been a huge help you can steam veggies as well so their perfectly cooked you cant beat the price either awesome buy and i totally recommendbest gift ever

10183,5,i had this same brand of rice cooker for  years and it worked great up until the end bought a different makemodel and it was terrible made a huge mess i bought another one of these which is what i should have done in the first place and again works great i hope it lasts another  yearsgreat rice cooker
7043,2,i agree with the other reviewer that the solution leaves horrible residue no matter what amount i used no idea what to do with my sensor nowbad solution

1019,1,was unable to rechargebad camera
7228,2,not sure how to attach strap and no instructions with it confusing
2461,1,so far i have had no luck with this camera all my pictures are turning out blurry ive tried almost everything so not sure what it could be was super excited to take pictures but the quality stinks i read nothing but great reviews so very disappointed however it is easy to useno luck
11954,5,wash your rice follow the directions and you will always have a perfect result between the ease of cleaning and storage love the handle and the perfectly cooked rice you cant go wrongperfect rice no hassle
14475,5,"this rice cooker is very good for making small batches of rice can do oatmeal too easy to use instructions are clear and multilingual also has a nice trouble guide as well also when cooking is complete the cooker will go into warm modethe only thing that i would change on it is the length of the power cord at  inches  mmnice cooker"
5207,1,my child loved this camera taking pictures and playing the few games he took care of it but after  months the camera would no longer charge and wouldnt turn on  disappointed because he was exploring photography and really having fun with it wish it lasted longerstopped working after a few months
7142,2,pros super easy to use quick app never has failed me on iphone  plus or iphone secons pictures never come out right sometimes the darks are too dark sometimes its washed out its never consistent so you have to edit to accommodate for the effect it has on the picture but sometimes it causes you to over correct them and make the washed out or darkened effect worseinconsistent
9223,1,battery would not click into placedidnt work
290,1,update worthless panasonic customer service good camera is no good without good customer servicei bought this to replace my aging  i have loved and used for eight years this camera is much improved in its featuresespecially the manual focus and quick adjustments on camera settingsi will still carry my  as a backup camera and take out on kayak and boating tripsexcellent bridge camera
2425,2,this camera is alright not the best for people who are trying to get into photography since this is a digital camera i would suggest using a regular phone for your photo but for anyone whos really into taking pictures get anything else that does not only have a screen in the frontday time okaynight time not goodany lowlight shots arent good for this cameraconsider another camera
10384,5,"okay ill give it five stars based on the rice it produces and easy of use and design it does indeed make pretty much perfect rice white brown wild etc as well as other grains it comes with a little measuring cup the water level marks inside none too easy to see are calibrated for the number of these little cups of grain you use but the cup is about  cup why because thats  the standard japanese rice serving measure but thats no big deal nor is it a problem that the water marks inside are hard to read just use one measure of water to one measure of rice i know thats different from your usual ratio for stovetop ricetheres a little bit of learning to do at first i use more water with brown rice more like  water to one brown rice and some rice is drier than other rices and need more water i find that you can have a little more water but you dont want to have too little because the rice will be less than fully prepared for instance i forgot about the little measuring cup and absentmindedly used a full one cup measure but added water to the line for two gou i got slightly underdone riceremember that the cooker knows when the water has been absorbed rice cookers work because so long as there is free water in the pot the temperature cannot rise above  at sea level so all the pot need do is stop cooking and reduce temperature to warm when the pot temperature rises about  thats why it works for all grains and that means the cooker doesnt really know when the rice is done only when the water is gonenow you will see all sorts of different ratios recommended by rice cooker recipes and for different cookers lots of people use  for white rice quinoa is happier with a  ratio anything reasonably close will work so long as you use enough water for the grain to be fully cooked when the water is gone if you use a little more water than you needed it will go on cooking until absorbed the worst that will happen is that it might get a little softer than youd like and you can even fix it when you open the pot and find it isnt quite done just add a bit more water and start the cycle again the cooker will still know when that water is absorbed thats the lovely thing about a rice cooker it can sort of peak under the lid for you plus it doesnt have to be watchedgreat rice and a tolerant cooker"
4147,1,day before my trip getting camera ready the tiny ss card broke while trying to put in  time very upset and now no camera for intl tripsmall ss card broke  time use
12124,5,"ive used it a handful of times now i bought an amazon warehouse used one so was a little worried but it works great and i think it was worth the money it makes absolutely perfect white rice brown rice was good too but its harder to get excited about brown ricethe instructions are a little overcomplicated and theres a seal around the top that needs to be cleaned after each use but still so worth itmagic"
4839,1,i literally received a case no camera no flim just a pink case do not buy
7716,1,upon opening the box the first thing i noticed was the viewing screen was scratched up pretty bad no protective film from the factory once i picked up the camera i immediately new this was a bad choice it is so light it doesnt feel real the view finder screen has a very poor quality picture something reminiscent of a late  early  flip phone camera hoping it was only the screen quality and not picture quality i snapped a few test pictures and uploaded them to the computer only to find the picture quality is awful definitely not  yes i took the lens protective film off first maybe this one was a fluke i highly doubt it though i wouldnt pay  for thisvery poor quality
2423,1,returned the camera could not get it to work instruction booklet was worthlessit did not work
8756,2,suuuuuuper dark photos inside will try outside once the snow clears got this as a present for my  yo and it requires a lot more skill to capture a quality photo than i expected i dont recommend this camera well stick with it now that we have it but wish i would have believed the reviewsnot good for indoor photos
10497,4,like the ricer and the fact it comes in colors wish it was just a tad larger like  cups but still goodit is smaller than the picture  cups only but still good for  people
1599,1,my daughter is away at college and kept telling me that as soon as the camera is unplugged it turns off even when it says it shows fully charged i thought she had to be doing something wrong but i was finally able to go see her this weekend and sure enough it doesnt work we tried both batteries and a different charger very disappointingnever worked
16767,5,bought this usedexcellent condition and it came nearly perfect with the exception of a small scratch there are a ton of functions  its a little complicated to figure out but reading the manual was very helpful love it works great excellent rice cooker
17623,5,lightweight not too large to store i like the retractable cord brown rice perfect though does take  minutesperfect brown rice
14764,5,korean product for rice cooker is working perfect easy to use and good tastesimple use
13425,5,my mother passed down her panasonic rice cooker she purchased in japan in the late  i used it until it finally gave out a few years ago it looked exactly like this little rice cooker it is perfect for my husband and i kids all grown and moved out and hope it lasts at least half as long as the panasonic but then again as we all know things just arent made the same these days crossing fingersjust like my old panasonic from japan
3979,1,dont recommend at all broke the first night i got it tried to fix it and wouldnt let me return or even message seller whatever i guess if you buy good luck at least it comes with a lot of stuffabsolutely not
1022,1,i bought this a month ago for my son to go to brazil to serve for our church we are getting him packed and i was trying to show him how to use it because he is used to a phone it will only go on if it is plugged in i have charged it and read all the instructions i of course bought it more than a month ago adding it to the pile of things he is taking based on the reviews i didnt think we would have problems wrong so frustratingdoesnt work
2483,1,photos are bad quality and out of focus constantly focus comes brokenbad quality
9485,5,can always have fresh rice do wish it had an automatic turnoff feature as it will stay on keep warm until unplugged so if you forget about it the bottom becomes brownedperfect for one or two
4227,1,oh my goodness im not sure where to begin i charge the camera for a total of  hours and when i powered it on it was still red with only one line of charge the camera froze on me twice before i could even take a photo i kept receiving an error message so then i had to constantly restart the camera the print quality is horrible and pixelated you get better photos with your phone i couldnt believe how bad the quality was after viewing the photos on my computer i immediately came to amazon to do a refundreturn stick with the brand namesdont waste your time or money
8086,1,lens broke offi send it back right away more than a month ago and still havent received my refundlens broke off
12255,5,i was nervous to buy this looking at the price tag but this appliance alone has become a staple in my kitchen i use it for everything including steaming and making cakes the timer is a lifesaver as i work night shift and dont have to worry about preparing rice an hour ahead the extended heat function keeps rice fresh for days and the manual is incredibly detailedamazing
360,2,the camera its self is so cute and nostalgic it reminds me of my childhood so bad that the picture quality is like a razor flip phone so nostalgic
1798,1,i took maximum  photos in this camera and it stopped workingstopped working in one use
7241,2,got the reconditioned  and it was not in good shape the battery door was missing there were no charging cords and the previous owner info was still present in the camera it was because the camera wasnt factory reset that i could not access it and put my own info in the savings were good but the problems didnt make it worth it and i returned itreconditioned failure
519,1,waste of money  please do something else with your money  dont throw it awayif only i can rate it below one star i would have waste of money
7363,1,total waste of money once it was connected to the table i struggled to get my subject in the view cant do any sizing i wasted my moneywaste of money
5521,1,in my life i had made a purchase as bad as this i am a seller on etsy store and i wanted to give a better quality to the photos of my products than those i took with my phone which is an iphone xr and i never thought that my phone was taking better photos than this really expensive garbage i still dont understand why there are people who still say in the ratings that it is a good product when this does not take a well focused photo with quality it does not have a good image in short a very bad chinese copy is this  i really do not recommend spending even   on this because a motorola phone from  takes better photos than thisdont buy this
455,1,this camera has been nothing but blurry and wont focus im having such a hard time either this camera i feel i wasted my money the camera never ever focuses from i got it i never ever got a good picture its not worth it camera doesnt focuscamera doesnt focus and takes blurry pictures
8293,1,i really tried to give this product a chance it was a christmas gift for my  year old son he was super excited but honestly its been a nuisance and this morning ive had enough unfortunately my return window has passed but i wish i had just returned it because its nothing what i expected no sound no directions the little clip on the side snapped its just a mess complete waist of moneycheap no instructions disappointed
8256,1,so i thought this camera was cute and bought it to give as a gift but i was really disappointed when it arrived it was obvious that i received a used product the box was already unsealed and slightly dirty when it arrived normally the box is taped down andor wrapped in plastic the items inside are usually wrapped in plastic and secured none of this was the case in fact the only plastic container in the box was even crumpled looking and everything looked like it was just stuffed in the box this is completely unacceptable even more so since this was supposed to be a gift luckily i have time to return it and try to get a new onei attached photos of how it arrivedthe camera itself looked clean and seemed to power on which is the only reason why it got a second star it is much smaller than anticipated i would guess the dimensions are about   inches it has two cameras one forward and one reverse so you can do selfies you can switch between a bunch of different filtersstickersupdate so the seller wont let me return the item big red flag there i then tired using amazons atoz guarantee refund but the stepbystep instructions are useless as they dont actually match the available options so you are unable to actually submit a requestavoid this camera there are other option available or buy directly from a trustworthy websitecompanyavoid this camera  received a used product  cant return it
2793,2,i wasnt expecting anything spectacular for this camera based on the price but when i opened the box it is just a glorified disposable camera very light and cheap plastic feeling we charged the camera and set it up anyway there is a several second delay when you press the shutter button to when it actually captures the photo so there goes the opportunity to take fast and candid photos also when we pressed the shutter button along with the delay it would take multiple pictures with one press of the shutter button super glitchy certainly sending this back and looking for other digital camera optionsglorified disposable camera
11119,5,"description is misleading theres no way this little bitty cooker cooks six cups its more of a personal sized cooker a small one at thatupdate it might be on the small side but its the best rice cooker ive had the steamer attachment is a big  cup small but awesome worth every penny"
257,1,i couldnt be more disappointed in a product i have yet to even be able to take a picture with this camera and now it wont even turn on with a fully charged battery extremely disappointing product dont waste your moneyterrible
6726,1,i never write reviews for anything honestly i was really looking forward to getting this bag it seemed to fit exactly what i was looking for it wasnt the straps are thin stiff pieces of foam the dividers are extremely flimsy and overall nothing on this bag justifies its price tag the second i placed my  film camera in the bag it bent all of the dividers out of whack i was disappointed because had they used some more premium materials and slightly better design i would absolutely love this thingdont believe the marketing
10640,5,easy to use definitely a good purchasepractical
5061,1,the product arrived without a box packed in a ziplock i was so disappointed i would surely return it if it was not my daughters christmas gift i was really upset to give her a present that came in a ziplock like something used the camera is good but not great the photo quality is poor and it is really easy to burn them do not recommenddo not recommend

13471,5,works perfect we cook  cups and rinse rice well in a rice rinse bowl and have no have no problem at all with bubble over this is my second rice cooker from these folks and works amazing for a low cost simple rice cooker if you made the max amount of rice it may be an issue but our last rice cooker was a  cup and seemed too large so we downsized and this  cup is perfect for our  cups of dry rice we use rice measuring cup provided and then fill water to lines on inside and it makes perfect rice did not need to adjust at all perfect jasmine cal rose and basmati rice every timelove it
13207,5,for the price i paid this rice cooker was a no brainer very pleasantly surprised i had a basic small rice cooker for years and never had enough rice even when it was just for one person i needed a bigger one i saw the well reviewed fancy ones on here for over  dollars and considered that i am sure they are great but this one works very well for my purposes i dont cook rice every day like some people this one makes a large batch it works similar to my old small basic one but in large amountsgreat value
14785,5,i love the way the rice tastes when made in this ricer no more soggy rice and the rice is wonderfulgreat rice maker
2842,1,good for kids or beginners or just a good simple camera to take around with youupdate this camera sucks after only a few months the camera told me it was missing a card even though it wasnt all of my pictures are gone and it is unusable buy a better cameracamera sucks
5901,1,bought this for my daughter it was her big gift from santa when it arrived i charged it up and loaded the film so it would be all set for use today christmas day she was excited but after taking just a couple of pictures it died i thought it was weird that it didnt hold the charge but figured no big deal well the charging light has remained red and the camera wont even power up when plugged in yes im using the cord that came with it but its clearly not taking the charge no christmas pictures this year super disappointing for both me and my daughter santa flop with this one for suredisappointed  santa failed
6833,1,it stopped working after a weekcheap dont buy it

34,5,work perfectly easily use they do a good jobeasy to use
1950,1,it is hard to believe a product like this is being sold it is impossible to use you can put the battery in the memory card goes in and you can turn the camera on thats where it ends there is no way to get anything out of the camera no way to charge the battery and no way to preserve or send any pictures the camera sits there useless until the cam corder eventually diesthe picture with the product shows a battery charger with extra batteries but i cannot determine how the camera is supposed to connect to the real worldthe item i received does not work there are no cords in and no cords out
2227,1,the picture and information shows  boxes of film for  pictures i received only  boxes since its so close to my daughters bday im stuck keeping it at least the camera itself is really cutepicture is deceiving
17593,5,"we finally did it after  years with the same rice cooker we finally bought a new one it wasnt broken but it was just time we went back to the same brand zojirushi is basically the gold standard of rice cookersseems silly now to think how long we waited to get a new one this machine makes even the cheaper brands of rice taste delicious who knew it was so good that we actually bought my mom one a few weeks later the same exact one true story she loves hers too if you use your rice cooker daily as we do get the best one you can afford its very easy to use and we havent had to take out the manual once its that easy its been great on every setting and who doesnt love this little guys chime when it starts and when it ends very kawaiiwho knew rice could taste this good"
6622,2,unfortunately i have to return my  every single photo taken at the vga  and  setting is slightly blurry every one also it takes longer to focus than my coolpix  i press the shutter and sometimes its a full second before the picture is taken disappointed i thought this would be an upgrade to my  but it isntdisappointed i thought this would be an upgrade to 
17333,5,"i like how this makes rice its precise and makes perfect rice every time ive made brown basmati brown short grain jasmine and sticky rice all good its pretty easy to clean just three components to wash the bowl the steam condensing plastic tray and the metal gasket lid i havent run into any issues i contemplated getting the smallest version  c i think and this version im glad i got the  cup as it is nice and small and likely not much bigger than the  version i usually make   at a time which by rice cooker standards is sometimes not possible depending on the model as the rice wouldnt cook and would start to burn i really appreciate i can make perfect small batches of rice i would make a bigger batch with guests or for meals to go for a party or outing my leftover rice also stays very good yes this rice cooker takes a little extra time to cook but i dont care because the rice comes out so perfectly if it took any shorter the rice wouldnt be cooked as well and wouldnt be worth the price i cant speak about any other zojirushi machines but i can say this is worth the price i expect a long life from this machine and all parts are available from zojirushi direct if neededmakes tasty rice"
8664,2,we expected the up close clarity to be much better than it was compared to other comparable cameras it was blurrynot the best close up pics
5896,2,dont know if camera works  stars bcuz packaging was previously water damaged it had dried before i opened it but camera box and contents seriously damp will put camera in rice would hate for a good product to be destroyed like this amazon customer service is sending a replacement so glad itll be here before granddaughters bday cant give her this box  star for servicepackage damage  product damp
3705,2,it broke the second day that i did a set up for our studio photos the magnet panel doesnt hold well good light tone but not worth the money paidtoo fragile

5592,1,i really want a refund for this cause this is so bad 
4642,1,this is an item sold by ali express meant to appear to consumers as an sd card reader that fits usbc or standard usb this is a feature of their marketing the item is in fact a prop and has no technical function purchase your tech from a different sellerthis is not an sd card reader it is an aliexpress prop
1515,1,burns through the batteries even alkaline after a few pictures battery slot needs to be  mm deeper i need to really force the cover to close my guess is after a few battery changes the cover will break in my hands edges of all pictures are always out of focus i dont know how to turn on the flash because nothing in the manual mentions the flash at all ive had it for  days to late to return it dont make that mistake 
4597,1,im so disappointed bought this for my birthday and half the time you take a picture nothing comes outjust bought and pictures only come out half the time

1032,1,poor quality pics returned itdont buy
1443,1,gotta be honest my cell phone takes way better pictures than this thing with a  camera i bought this thing so i wouldnt have to pull the backing off my phone and stick a sim card in every time i needed to do ebay but the pictures were so blurry after about  tries of changing setting and doing all that stuff i just sat it down on my desk and its been a paperweight ever sincemy cell phone takes way better pictures than this thing with a  camera
4526,1,the unit is not robust enough to be used on a adventure bikes for offroadthe accessories should be supplied that mention motorbike bundle the camera should then come with proper protection for this type of use which is commonly advertised by  on insta camera misleading
4395,1,ordered two of these for my significant other and me to show vacation pictures instruction manual is minimal and no way to have a live conversation with customer service ive loaded one frame one way and the other another way and cant understand how i did it in the first place so confusing would never have purchased these if i had known the hours id be spending to do something that should be simple im pretty computer savvy but this is extremely confusingmuch too difficult
16961,5,at first i thought it was too complicated but after reading the manual my rice comes out perfectlove it
947,1,this camera is worse than a phone camera and feels like a cheap toy the description is misleading unfortunately we missed the return window but i highly recommend you do not buy thisthis camera is terrible
2974,1,neither film packs fed into the camera they seem damaged i r defective awfully pricey film for this kind of issue not happy at all may have damaged the camera itselfbad film packs do not work may have damaged camera

2652,2,the quality of the pictures are not good for the price you can get a better camerablurry images
7297,1,i bought this gopro camera in december as a christmas present it worked well for  months then the display screen stopped working i contacted the manufacturer and learned that because the factory depot is not an approved seller they will not honor the one year warranty i contacted the factory depot and they will not accept a return after  days this is highly disappointing all aroundcareful about who you buy this from if you want your manufacturer warranty to be honored
3273,1,cannot get it in focus will need to contact nikon in ireland to solve the problem or try and change the lens bad experience so farbad experience so
2099,1,it was expensive so we got approved for a payment plan and then they took out all the money at once so i returned it very dissatisfiedstay true to ur word
13536,5,"this rice cooker is everything i wantedi bought this rice cooker for a few reasons first i wanted a brand i knew i could trust to deliver good rice and zojirushi is the best brand of rice cookers second i wanted something cheap thats why i was happy to find this model which is about  depending on the size you go with lastly i wanted a rice cooker that was small and the  cup size is perfect for me and boy do i love the simplicity of flipping a switch and letting the rice cook all on its ownfyi only the  cup and  cup sizes come with the steamer basket and the keep warm function however neither of these were important to memy favorite type of rice is jasmine rice so thats what ive used this product for and it turns out perfect no more spending half an hour trying to get my rice to cook all the way only for it to end up a pasty mushy messthe included measuring cup and spoon are a great addition and cleaning the rice cooker after use is very simple i just wish this also included something to wash my rice in as i had a difficult time getting my rice fully washed with what i have at homeand to anyone worried while some reviews have had issues with this product i have not experienced splattering or burnt rice as long as youre washing your rice and are using the correct ratio of rice and water you shouldnt have any problems i dont know if its true but someone said that the included measuring cups  cup does not match the united states idea of  cup so i would guess your rice could end up burnt if youre using a us measuring cupa rice cooker you cant pass up"
6233,2,i have a nikon  and this was really difficult to get in place with it i liked that it had two openings for your arms so you could still focus and shoot as usual but this cover was awkward to use and it was constantly sliding over the front of my lens i only used it twice then gave up and just put my camera away when it rained its a good concept but would be better if made for specific camera models rather than using the one size fits all approachnot as useful as hoped

17322,5,"i tend to be critical about japanese white rice this one definitely makes the best japanese white rice that i have ever made at homei conducted my own taste test by preparing the same japanese rice on this cooker and one other nonih rice cooker also made in japan that also produces excellent rice the rice was washed in exactly the same manner where the kernels were gently rubbed while damp never letting it sit in the murky water i added some agar as typical to both cookers the cookers operated sidebysideresults this zojirushi ih cooker is the winner the key difference was in the individual kernels when you chew into a nonih kernel you can feel the softness on the outer side of the kernel but the center is harder the ih cooker produced a kernel that was cooked  evenly not too soft and not too hard all the way through the ih cooker kernels had just the right amount of stickiness between each kernel so that the kernels didnt bunch up so tightlywhile such factors may sound insignificant in the end they matter these details are analogous to how one may evaluate a loaf of bread made from identical ingredientsit was amazing to see how the exact same rice came out so differently between the two cookers i would not go back to nonih in the future and i will buy zojirushi againih induction heat is worth it"
3177,1,this camera will go off with the slightest shadow or grass moving where my normal trail cameras would never have an issue the customer service reacted as if i had never used a trail camera before would not recommendterrible experience

283,1,loved the camera at first but after about a week of minimal use the screen turned black and only the view finder works tried messing with settings and no luck googled for help and it seems this is a common problem with these cameras i took great care of this camera while i had it and did a lot of research before purchasing i did not know about the screen problem until it happened to mefaulty screen
9007,2,used this to shoot a short film the auto lens is practically useless as things are super digitally and only good for bloggingbut i decided to use some of my old glasses that i use on the dslr the results were less than average for daytime shots as things were too bright and did not produce the cinematic effect so to speak it was hell to work with exposurethe camera has a better low light performance and the image stabilization is good that being said even the low light videos look too digital with high contrast etc my dslr shots are way better in comparisonfor bloggers this might be ok but for cinema purposes i would say noexposure issues
5123,1,its a junk never buy itjunk

905,1,very stupid decision on my part i was hoping for pointandshoot quality but its  worse than the camera on my old android phone i tried using once realized i made a huge mistake and went for return since it has lithium batteries there are complicated shipping instructions you have to adhere a million warning labels to the box in just the right way or they wont accept it this product should not even be allowed to be sold on amazon or anywhere else the quality is so bad save up and get yourself a real camera from a good company or buy a good camera secondhand not this cheap flea market craplearn from my mistake please dont buy this
13927,5,"i will admit to only using this once so i cannot speak to its lasting power but it is easy to use with a cleaver measuring system to where you dont need to measure your water anymore and make a perfect batch of white ricei struggle making white rice although it sounds easy i can never get it to the correct consistency that youd have at any restaurant this device solves that its small and quiet while making a batch with perfect consistency there was no excess water at the bottom and no scorched bits stuck to the bottomit can also make more than the manual says it can make  cups of uncooked rice but thats like  services in my bookgreat for what it does"

2594,1,we did everything the instructions guide told us to do the camera simply does not work even put in different batteries the camera looks great and our grandchild was very excited  and then disappointeddoes not work period
695,1,everyone in the reviews said this camera had picture quality close to their professional camera it definitely does not the pixels are terrible and it compares to the cheap kids cameras they have on here every photo in the sun is over exposed and cannot be edited after too late to return it because by the time i downloaded the pictures onto a computer i already got rid of the packaging very disappointed that i wasted my money do not recommend also the sd card does not stay in like some of the reviews said i have to manually hold it in for it to workterrible quality

13434,4,exchanging for the  cup the size of this thing was extremely confusing this is for three cups of dry rice and three cups of watersize of the rice cooker   cups dry  cups water
152,2,low res bad light truly a bad purchase and no value for loads of  i paid exposures cost a fortune just a way for fujifilm to recover their lost profits from digital camera revolution 
7668,1,it came on but didnt take pictures had to return it for another onedidnt take pictures
7978,2,i like the idea of a printer and camera in one but as the first one to launch from instax this is definitely a disappointment the pictures come out extremely dark and if not yellow ive been using instax for years now so i know what the good pictures turn out to be like didnt even use up all my instax films as this is too disappointing definitely not recommended 
8663,1,my child used this camera a few times and it took pictures fine however after this waterproof camera was placed in shallow water it stopped working and will not even turn on this was the childs birthday gift and i am now a few days out from being over the  days since this product was received so i cant get my money backterrible

9280,2,makes rice fine but when its in keep warm the rice on the bottom gets crispy hard other rice cookers i had dont do that also the button to open gets stuck most of the time so its hard to open only had this rice cooker less then a weekkeep warmhard rice
5849,1,was not at all like explained if the camera was on the motor ran constantly so you couldnt leave it on for a minutes if you were waiting for more photes like my canon  or the  hs otherwise your battery would not last more than a  day it was always deadwas not at all like explained if the camera was on the motor ran 
3846,1,no memory card is included i can not to anything with the camera now why wasnt a memory card includedthe instruction book was not helpful how can i order a memory cardhow do i get a memory card
2267,2,very frustrated that despite using quality batteries and changing them more than once this camera almost immediately says warning battery exhausted and shuts off the camera has basically been unusable online i have read others expressing this frustration very disappointedno battery
4699,2,it is working but not as good as expected i have to connect it and reconnect it more than once to workmany other better alternatives
14265,5,the rice comes out better than i have ever made it does take a little longer but with the timer function i can do it ahead and it is one part of dinner that is already taken care of i did have to read the directionstwice clean up is a breeze my third rice cooker and by far my favoritei liked to so much i bought one for my son and his wife
1880,1,although it was new the image quality is terribly bad i returned itfaulty
8868,1,the camera card slot in camera is now broken so the card wont click inthis has been garbage from day onedont buy
11095,4,not as good as the original but still fine this does not have a bellchime for when it switches from cook to keep warm my old one would have a slight mechanical bell when the switch popped up from cook to keep warm  no big deal youve just got to remember to watch it its also on as soon as you plug it in  so if the lever is at keep warm its going to start warming as soon as you plug it in it also will stay on warm forever until you unplug it i want to say my original one had an off setting but i cant be sure the cord is permanently attached to the cooker  the old one detached like an old coffee pot or popcorn maker its no big deal but just something to know i do find the steaming basket works very well  as others have noted dont blame the cooker if foam escapes and spurts all over the counter its the type of rice andor the preparation rinse rice until the water runs clear and that solves the problem removing the excess starch i like it much better than trying to deal with making rice on the stove and the steaming is very easy and an added bonusgreat basic rice cookersteamer
4241,1, the camera will not power on at all i have charged both batteries that came with it and still nothing i will be returningwill not power on
3975,1,the batteries they sent with it didnt work they were melted together i didnt get all the film they said i would get because one was empty and repackaged and another one was opensome of my film was open 
308,2,its ok but the lens is  asstwo stars
7320,1,cant use the gopro app because its password protected cant connect it to my computer to reset it because the software or firmware is corrupted you sold me a bricked piece of garbagepassword protected from previous owner corrupted firmware incompatible with my pc
5909,2,the camera is very easy to use but the picture quality is terrible the pictures almost look a shade of green my  year old nieces fujifilm instax camera takes better pics definitely would not recommend itpoor picture quality but easy to use
6878,1,would not worki received the camera and it did not work
14758,5,we absolutely adore our rice cooker and use it daily thank you so much for making such a user friendly device my teenager loves making their rice everydaybest thing ever
4315,1,i chose this sling pack because it was supposed to provide a better fit for women however the strap has padding only on a short portion and none at all on the edges with my narrow shoulders it cut into my neck so painfully that i could barely use it empty lightly loaded it was a cruel joke i also felt painful digging from the buckle for the side strap when that strap was not in useif the strap seems to fit a well endowed woman better than the lowepro  after which it is modeled that is only because the placement of the strap is impossibly uncomfortable on the neck if you have wide shelves for shoulders it might work in any case wear it loaded around the house before taking it out in the field five minutes told the tale for mepadding on strap very poor
2113,1,this product did not work and i even look at youtube to find a solution there was none so it was a waste of time and money the light keep flashing and i even changed the battery numerous times and the results are the samewaste of time
13564,4,i have rarely put more than two cups of rice in the cooker at a time no matter how much rice i put in there will be a little or a lot boil over the product is easy to cleangreat for a cheap model
5946,1,i am heavily disappointed with this camera first to begin with the very first time using the camera the pictures were not visible and the screen was covered in colorful dotsi turned the camera on and off for a few times but it did not work secondly as i turn the camera on to take a picture it does not work  the screen is black and the flash would go off and freeze even after i turn the camera on and off i am so disappointed with this camera i rate it a zero i do not recommend purchasing this camera save yourself the money and hassledont waste your money
9140,2,this brand has okay quality but i wasnt satisfied with it ok quality
8697,1,cannot charge does not work off of batteries either will not stay on longer than  or  secondsdoes not work
13773,5,we majorly upgraded with this machine i officially feel like an adult ive used it  times so far  twice for white rice once for oatmeal and once to steam eggs i figured it was going to make rice perfectly and it does the steaming of eggs was simple and worked great the surprise was oatmeal  was skeptical about the other functions but thought id give it a go using my combination of almond milk  brown sugar and water with the oatmeal selected the oatmeal preset and  later the oat meal was perfect so far i love it and was well worth the money hopefully this will be the last rice cooker i will ever purchaseexcellent rice cookersteamer
874,1,camera didnt not work not even for one picture change batteries and it still turn off quickly very disappointednot good 
2784,1,this is supposed to be a whole set of items i ordered two of these and neither box included all of the listed items we only got the camera the bag one film there are supposed to be  extra films and stickers as wellwhere are the remaining items
11215,4,first time using it top is perfect bottom is soggy its better after a good stir i like everything about itits cute
2598,2,it only came with  packs of filmfalse advertising
1979,2,the quality of picture is the same on this maybe worse than the polaroids  years ago was hoping for something a little better when it came to the pics if i was you id get one of those little printers that print pics from your phone to look like a polaroid not as expected
7656,1,stopped working within a month of purchasedo not buy
5245,2,so i bought this camera based on several reviews that said it takes great pictures and that the quality was awesome i cant disagree there however i wish someone would have mentioned that the battery for this camera does not hold a charge at all we recently visited universal studios in orlando and my wife wanted to take pictures as we walked around the pictures were great unfortunately we didnt get many of them as the battery kept dying midway through our day its not like we were leaving it on and we were fully charging it at night so i dont understand the problemif the battery could keep a charge i would give it  stars but because i missed so many pictures on our vacation because of the battery i cannot rate this camera very highlygreat cameraif you only need about  or  pictures a day battery sucks
7677,2,unlike panasonics own youtube tutorial the advertised webcam capability is not incorporated in this model with the lumix webcam software installed when you connect the camera using the supplied cable the viewfinder does show the necessary pc tether option it will only output the lumix home screen not the lens image since there is zero coverage of the webcam feature in the manual or panasonics site other than the youtube video you arent getting that featureok so you dont want to use it for video streaming is it okit apparently has no onboard storage like some of the cameras in this price range regardless of the word optional associated with the sd card you need one it appears nothing in the instructions say it needs additional storage unless you go past  but it doesok you didnt expect it to have onboard storage is it okthe camera is quite dainty the onoff switch is smallest ive seen on a camera if it cold out or you are wearing thin gloves you might have to operate the switches visually instead of by feel you have to operate some of the features like charge port the lcd viewfinder the top view focus knob the flash with your fingernails if you have no fingernails you might have to bring something to work it i will guess the charge port door will be the first thing to break on it since its flimsy and not restrained welli havent decided whether ill field test it or not i was going to use it for automotive vlogs but i doubt it will handle light field duty am i expecting too much at this price point perhaps thats why i gave it two stars ill keep using my  year old camera until i make up my mindi wasted  hours trying to make the webcam feature work i have many webcams but i thought this would be a step upupdate while the camera was sold in midfebruary  it did not have the november  camera body firmware update  this is what enables webcam capability sort of it does not transmit audio like most webcams do it is simply a device driver for the video output the updating process is not well documented but here is an  formal sd card with  put sd card in  locate  firmware on panasonics site and  unzip the file into the root directory of the sd  put sd card back in camera turn on camera switch to review images modethe documentation does not necessarily match the  screensit doesnt change my opinion on two stars since the docs are poor and it becomes a videoonly webcam even though it has a microphoneif you wanted webcam capability internal storage or a field camera poor choice
4728,2,its not really a bad thing as its expected but the camera will only print  photos tops before it kills the battery thermal printers are power hogsthermal printer kills battery
510,1,this product didnt work at all after i switch on it prompts to few settings and when i finish the settings it switches off the camera i could not use it at all its wastage of moneythis product didnt work at all after i switch 
1187,2,this camera is loaded with features has  and  optical zoom great value camera to learn how to use advance features without spending piles of money but just cant get over the fact that it uses non chargeable batteries really makes it a pain if your using it heavily or doing videossweet feature packed camera but uses standard battries
3575,1,took it to the beach using the handle it came with the quick connect that it uses either totally failed or is a horrible design it literally fell off walking into the ocean with the  wave fell to the bottom of about  feet of water and was gone looked for hours for it dont trust that quick connect setup for anything except walking around with itlost on day one
5905,1,i read really bad reviews on this product but said screw it and bought it anyways i regret it this product is not worth  at all the case it comes with does not fit the kodak unless you squish it in there and the funny this is its not even the right case the picture quality is not good i honestly am disappointed if you wanna buy it consider this just buy the camera you dont need the extra things its not even close to worth the price point wishing i could return it honestlyread the reviews
11120,5,cooks rice and steams works perfectlyworks perfectly
438,2,the lens is not what i expected i thought theyd be stronger there are no instructions this camera is a lot more difficult to understand than my little sureshot my little camera takes better pictures than the canin eos 
3636,1,i ordered this for my favor her birthday unfortunately after she opened it  we went to use it was broke only printed out black or white pics  was missing sing  boxes of film sent it back for a full refundbroken
1946,1,i really wanted to like this little camcorder it is very nicely designed seems to function well and has a remote that works very well to pause or take stills from a distance however that is the only really properly working thing in the camcorder kit i received the socalled  video looks like scenes from a comicbook or a paintbynumber canvas very flat with little detail i would have been alright with that had the audio been good alas the sound recorded using the internal mic was bad and using the external mic made it worse whether off at  db or   since i had hoped to record live music this was the deal breaker i found a similarlooking sony openbox for only  more that gives much better results and i can at least reuse this bag to protect that anyone need an almostnew remotethe remote is the best thing about this
10006,5,super easy to use and great price  different uses and easy to clean small enough to store on the counter without taking up too much space also on the smaller side but it actually makes a good amount for my house of  product
13101,5,thus is the cutest rice cooker ive used several times since getting it and the rice has always turned out perfect last time i even cooked rice and steamed some fresh corn on the cob and they both turned out perfecteasy to use
8513,1,review  after having read the bare bones user manual i proceeded to take my first picture after properly loading the batter and film cartridge promptly received a e error in the digital display afyer researching online since its not in the owners manual that error means there is something wrong with the lens mechanisms maybe what really stinks is the error trapping on the fuji website suggests changing film cartridge so i wasted  of those im sure theres no refund thereregardless after only having had it literally one day its going back to amazon and a replacement has been orderedthis is the highest rated instant camera for this price point on the internet and i figure its worth another chancereview  will come after i receive the replacementnot worth the time maybe
7488,2,i got the camera knowing that i am not going to be filming a lot and therefore did not want an expensive one so over the last  months i had this camera i used it all of  hours  times all together mostly in my car recording rides recently i got a kayak accessory that allows for the camera to be mounted on the side rail so i took the camera with and decided to film some kayaking and fishingfrom the first use i noticed that the buttons on the side up and down buttons did not have the same look and feel or the click sound as the power button or the shoot button the buttons did not click required  the force of the other buttons to work and were almost impossible to work with while the waterproof casing was on i did not make much of it as i did not use the camera a lot but i think those were faulty from the beginningon the last trip the buttons stopped working the camera is operational only from the touch screen but the side buttons do not work which means that i have to open the case every time i would like to change settings this made the trip very frustratingi expected more sturdiness form the camera given the camera is almost brand new the backscreen film is still on no scratches was never dropped and that i assumed these cameras to be for extreme sports otherwise the camera does what it is supposed to do videos are solid batteries last a while and if the buttons were not giving me problems this would be a solid purchase probably a lemoni might have gotten a lemon otherwise does the job
5564,2,i paid for the bundle that included the camera camera case and  sheets of film the  sheets of the film was not includeddidnt get the film that was included in the bundle
2228,1,really disappointed not a single one of the  pics i shot came out in focus regardless of the light conditions i had an old instax  before this which sadly broke comparing the old pics with the ones taken with the instax  really shows how horrible the quality is not sure what to do get another  maybe this is just a one off bad product but im definitely sending this one backblurry and bad lighting
3886,1,the product mentioned is incorrect the vendor has detailed the product with power ois but the lens does not have the power ois  the same is available at much lower price the description is deceing and misleading dont fall trap for this camera at this price point 
3334,2,it didnt come with a chargerbad
1712,1,i was not impressed very disappointed as it was so smallnot what i expected at all
191,1,i literally purchased this for the sole purpose of being able to drop videos from the camera to an iphone or ipad and i have just learned after unpacking it and trying to utilize it for my students that it is not possible and the videos must first be transferred via usb to a computer and then emailed to the phone i am extremely disappointed by thiscant wifi transfer videos
8867,1,vacation i should have used the reviews because some mentioned problems with the camera i would like to know how i can sent it back i was gone for  months and couldnt sent it backstopped working after  weeks and i was on vacation could not charge had to buy another camera
15491,4,upon unboxing i was surprised at how lightweight this is my last one was about the same size but a bit heavier i love the color looks more of a sky bluemint to me than green the rice paddle works well but is very thin and doesnt feel like it will last long the  cup measure cup is spot on it also comes with a recipe book that has a pancake recipe showing a stack of pancakes but it says they take  minutes to make one i am confused by this recipe but its nice they included some options i guess upon cooking the rice i started to freak out that there was a really bad chemical smell when it started heating i realized that it must be coming from the metal inside of rather than the actual part holding the rice i let it continue cooking and the rice was fine i do wonder if the ceramic coating is safe i love having a rice cooked again so much easier than making it on the stoveits nice to have a rice cooked again
3986,1,the camera stopped working after a few weeks of using itstopped working
4206,1,the camera quit working after the  picture return window expires quick on this product fyidont buy
5981,1,bought it in december for a trip to hawaii in april worked the entire trip with no problems has been stored in its case since took it out today july and it refuses to turn on dont think its a battery issue as prior it would come on when connected to charger even with battery removed  bucks and worked for  daysno longer powers up
9870,4,absolutely superb rice ive tried oatmeal and quinoa as well  following measurements carefully both of those led to liquid oozing out the overflow vent kept it because the rice is so perfect trying to mess around w the grain ratios overall happy to have it and use it a lotperfect rice other grains
9256,1,the camera felt cheaply made when i held it the pictures were horrible the zoom photos was so pixelated just stay away from this cameradont bother
14109,5,i heard about this brand form somewhere before thats why i was surprised and happy to see that they are selling it on amazon i love the color of this rice cooker because it matches all my other cookwares and the preset function is awesome i can prepare the rice hours ahead and it will be ready when i need it great producti love the color
6584,2,i bought and tried and returned this camera it had good reviews for dance photography and low light situations i was not satisfied i had originally purchased a way more expensive nikon dslr and loved it but couldnt justify the cost i now plan to save up to get that camera and am fine with my  until then this camera was fine i had a cool pix point and shoot years ago i lovedthis is bulky like a dslr but seems to produce more like a point and shootits ok
525,1,could not figure out the interface and i am quite technical dont buy itthere are better cameras
3606,1,once connected to the go pro something happens mid recording and you lose all of your audio something isnt connecting right once the battery supprt is plugged into the media mod the connection with the built in mic and the media mod gets crossed and lost you end up losing all audio it sucks i lost all my audio on a standup show i was doing i wouldnt buy the creator pack its garbagemic drops out and you lose all your audio
16648,5,i tried cooking brown rice and worked very well this is an excellent product 
4971,1,wifi doesnt work like other cameras supposedly through the app is how the link is created but it does not go beyond recognizing the camera this situation makes passing photos more difficult very badlywifi
6235,2,very bulky and uncomfortable kept my camera dry but almost couldnt get it on over my  lens also i have no idea what the velcro strap is forit was constantly in my photos and i had to remember to hold it to the side also my gloves kept getting stuck to the velcro the clear plastic is nice and thick but the rain cover in general is so big that it was very difficult to position the clear plastic over the viewfinder not worth the hassleitll be going in the trashnot worth the hassle
15869,5,there is four of us in my family and this rice cooker was able to hold enough for all of us it super easy to use and cleans up easily the ceramic coating is definitely a big plus very nice rice cooker 
8558,2,i desperately wanted this work and be great the photo quality is not very good but i could live with that the camera only worked with minimal use for  months and then just quit i just sent an email to fujifilm support to see if they will do anything about it total bummertotal bummer
1500,1,not worth itone star
868,1,received only camera and pouch all other items are missingmissing items

14720,5,stylish works great perfect for sushi or quick sides or snacksrice ready everyday
901,1,i can overlook any quality issues with a camera at least for the work i am doing but to have a camera cut off your videos after  min is unacceptable i thought it was just a fluke or something on my first recording because of how i set it up since i record for over an hour at a time i had plugged a portable charger to it but on my second take without it plugged in i still got the cut off video im going to return it and get something better as a presenter who needs to film  hours of footage at a time a camera with this severe of a flaw is useless its such a shame too because i loved everything else about the cameravideo cuts off after   min
397,1,the lenses suck i never got to use it and my lense already dont work now they dont wanna refund me my money not even refund jus send me a new lense for my camera but they say nomy money back
11066,5,im not even sure if it works yet because i just got it but if it does its a very versatile appliance and it will be worth the  bucks it cost me its small and wont take up much counter space which is a big pluscute and versatile
3204,2,the output of the flash is low and does not provide quality photos i needed to increase flash  in order to even compare with my canon flash forget bouncing flash as the output is very low this was a very poor purchasenot a quality flash
10461,4,"so i had a larger rice cooker previous to this regardless id only make two cups of rice each time so when that one decided to go on the fritz and undercook my perfectly portioned rice to water ratio i decided to downgrademy husband had actually gifted the pink version of this cooker to someone who enjoyed using it so i decided to give it a try but in a monotone that camouflages with my counters because you know visual clutterof course i made a mistake at first use of courseinstead of reading the instructions because pfft who does i winged it with my superior big brains and used my fancy culinary school supplied stainless steel  cup measuring cup for the rice and waterchaos ensued it was comical reallythe rice had fluffed up so much out of the bowl that the lid was just sitting elevated on top of a mound of rice like a hat which ended up undercooked of courseso i put my much more small and humble brains to work reading the instructions which said that i need to only use the cup measure that they placed in the box for a reason who knewthat resulted in the beautifully cooked and fluffy rice that you see presented to you in the photoi only use this for rice and not as a crock pot so i cant speak to that but so far as long as my brain stays humble and i resist the urge to use fancy cups i can have perfectly cooked rice whenever i want which is maybe once or twice a week you know carbs and all thatsmall but mighty"
4657,1,not recognized or only recognized for fractions of a second same results on multiple computers  os the first use it worked just long enough but now totally unusableworked once kind of
9655,5,"love this one rice cooker small but can cook up to  cups of ricesmall but can do the workperfect rice cooker"
16684,4,"preface im on a quest for the perfect reasonably priced rice cooker sadly this is not it the one for me my family eats white sticky rice every day so im looking for a rice cooker that looks good on the counter and not only makes tasty rice but also keeps it warm and soft for days my old panasonic was retired after  years it was replaced with a zojirushi  which made tastier rice but after a few months it started drying out rice on the keep warm setting i tried going back to a basic zojirushi with no bells and whistles zojirushi  but i realized that a micom microcomputer rice cooker does actually make rice with better taste and textureas for the cuckoo    uncooked micom rice cookerpros cooks rice well keeps rice warm without drying it out high quality nonstick finish on cooking pan versatile menu options compact design attractive appearance important since mine lives on the counter affordably pricedcons push button on front the whole unit slides back when you push the button topheavy lid in order to keep footprint small electronics are in the lid when you open the lid it has somuch momentum that the entire unit rocks back and forth quantity markings inside the pan are hard to read black on black i prefer a longer soak time in the programming of course one could just soak the rice before starting thecycle like i used to do with my old rice cooker it really does improve the taste and texture not a retractable cord no spatula holderfor the money it is a decent rice cooker but for me there are too many annoying things about it to put up with every daynot perfect but makes good rice"
5655,1,if you were hoping to save some money on a camera to take decent photos of your family travel etc this is not it there may not be a cheap option i was really hoping this noname brand camera was the answer but the pictures are basically as bad as an old flip phone such a hassle to return it but thats what i will donot the quality it claims to be
8072,2,i really wanted to love this camera and tried two different rounds of film one color  and one itype sadly the quality of the pictures was so poor you are much better off just sticking with your phone cameraphoto quality is poor
14869,4,it worked perfect the first time after that it still works but i have to run it twice i like the sizeim on the fence
2821,1,i purchased this camera because of the awesome reviews i havent even been able to use the camera yetthe reason is because i ordered the  gbsd card that is advertised to go with this camera but it doesnt fit no where does it state that this camara only uses the micro sd cards aka mini sd cards now i have to wait even longer to see if it will be as good as the reviewsnot very happy
3946,1,sadly this present didnt work out as plannedi unboxed and set it up following directions  my kid took two pictures and then bam the lights of deathwe trouble shot it and still could not even with fresh newer batteries get it to work so i returned it and bought the instax that the wirecutter recommended instead  the  in bluefingers crossed that one doesnt turn out to be a lemon like this one wastwo pictures and then  the lights of death
526,1,product only worked for  days then wouldnt work and was only used  timesbad product
6730,1,theres no permanent division between the bottom and top so small things can fall through the top to the bottom i returned it if it had a permanent sewn in dividing piece it would be perfectno sewn in middle piece
7337,1,the problem with this device is that it can only scroll out images that are within six to eight inches max you cannot get a decent size other than something on a small drawing padit is also very wonky in that you have to position yourself way over the lens in order to see the shadow form reflection youre better off getting a projector or just learning how to draw betteri returned mine the whole thing seemed a bit defectivecant do anything above a few inches
9125,1,this film was not worth the  bucks i paid i gave my son two packs i used once pack and have  left both my son and i did not have results as expected i want my money back this purchase is not warranted to either quality nor expectations here are just a few of the photos that i took except this review board will not allow me to share my photos and i have to keep typing to have  characters i will go ahead and say that it was a special day my motherss  birthday and we couldnt use the camera because of the poor qualitynot a good purchase
11113,5,cooki hrice cooker
9364,5,nice cooker easy to use and clean and the rice came outnicecooker
3358,1,pictures are blurry was suppose to stop motion i have tremors and needed something that stopped the photo but this was not the one even though it advertised that it diddo not recommend this camera
1108,2,the camera video quality was lacking the camera itself feels cheaper and like it would break easily ive tried using on multiple occasions and just cant get myself to like itfun little camera not for serious use
144,1,camera no longer works after only  months cant return because past the return window very disappointed should have gotten a different kind camera randomly wont shoot at all then if it does the film just comes out blankbroken after only  months
3844,1,this camera was poor quality i purchased it for my  year old since she loves taking photos the camera was very weak junky plastic i returned it because i knew one bump or drop and the camera would be in the garbageterrible quality
7604,1,these car about the size of an index card the picture is misleading dont waste your moneydont buy
14875,4,i have been more conscious about living a nontoxic lifestyle of course its not going to be perfect but trying my best i replaced all my nonstick pan with either glass or stainless steel and finally i replace my nonstick rice cooker with this loving it so far it cooks perfectly and no mess like the nonstick that i threw away totally happy with this purchase and highly recommend but i wish the lid does not have plastic at the bottom so when you cook youre cooking the plastic as well also the water gets into the lid so i have to unscrewed it every time when i clean im thinking of finding a different lidreplace my old nonstick to this nontoxic stainless steel
14861,5,this is amazing just follow the instructions and you will have rice i love itvery convenient
4631,1,tried both ends usb and apple side tried two different computers and two different operating systems called support but it went directly to voicemail it either came broken or its just junk buy from a reputable company instead lesson learned for medoesnt work
1597,1,the sd card it came with filled up after five pictures i bought a bigger sd card which it didnt recognize even after formatting it with the camera i bought a different one thinking it was a problem with the sd card and that still didnt work then i put the sd card that came with the camera back in and it didnt recognize it either this is a piece of junkdidnt work at all
4880,1,i normally never write a review because  of the time i have no complaints however this  is the reason im writing this review i purchased this so called bundle but i only received the camera where are the rest of my items am i able to get a refund or have the items im missing sent to mewhere are all my items
9130,1,if i could give  stars i would what i paid was not worth what i received  of the photos did not develop at all and the other  were still not the  of  photos never developed
9325,4,easy to use rice cooker perfect for those quick meals compact in size and easy to use rice comes out perfect every timemakes perfect rice
1113,2,buttons on top and back are difficult to usedifficult to use
1892,1, of the film cartridges only contained  photos instead of  purchased on february  and the camera stopped working all together days after the return window the photos were never rightthese are either duds or refurbished total nightmareso disappointed
9054,2,i have had issues ordering this film from amazon before the photos come out overexposed and i at first thought it was something i was doing wrong in inserting the film into the camera i talked to a polaroid specialist and they told me the film i was using was expired i just ordered another two pack of color film and when it arrived i saw that it expired  film
9327,4,the rice cooker looked modern and fairly easy to use in term of durability of cooking and mechanical latches it will need to be tested out over some length of times i will provide an update if running any issuesmodern design and easy to use 
5087,1,we went through  of these cameras and neither one of them worked for more than  days the first one was replaced and the second one was just past the window of return so were stuck with it throwing it outwent through  of these cameras neither worked for more than  days
10037,5,we just bought this rice cooker to replace our old one and we are super pleased with it it makes perfect rice every time and keeps it heated up afterwards it is super easy to clean as well with its non stick pot great product for a great pricebest lil rice cooker
852,2,i ordered this as a present for my daughter i received it in a very timely manner however it was missing the selfie lens which is the real reason i got this set howwho do i contact to get the missing piecesmissing pieces
9500,5,"this product is very easy to use instructions are simple for loading rice and water there are two minor issues i would like to see resolved but in no way detract from this devices operation once you have loaded the rice pan with water and rice the next step is to press the front lever to cook the rice but caution is needed here because there is a tendency for the rice cooker to tip over as the lever is pressed a simple fix for the manufacturer is to add a foot peg to the bottom front of the cooker otherwise hold the cooker in the back as you press the cook lever minor issue as the rice cooks it tends to boil the water thru the steam release hole in the cover making a bit of a mess on the table surface where the rice cooker sits "
7169,2,this was great for about  uses but the straps loosen on their own they arent easy to tighten on the fly eitherthought it was great
3701,2,the brightness is great and the adjustable color plates it comes with but the battery will not hold a charge so i have to keep it plugged into a power source which is very inconvenient when trying to do shoots outdoorsbright but power source is poor
5221,1,this product looked great and arrived in good shape it turned on however when the memory card provided is inserted the entire camera turns off look for a different productarrived broken  when memory card inserted screen went blank
10482,4,so easy  quick to make rice now will definitely be making all kinds of sushi soon as well as some harry playing in the kitchen lol made  cups of rice in the maker for a sushi bake and it was enough to spread on the bottom of a  pan dont be alarmed when the rice looks like it will overflow just watch it lol but  cups is the max id do i dont need to make big portions at a time but if you have bigger cooking aspirations than i do go for one that holds more than  cups otherwise im impressed very cute  small where it doesnt take up lots of space in your cabinets great addition to my appliancesmusic for a sushi restaurant
9639,5,for the price its a no brainer unless you need to make more than a few cups at a time you simply just set it and forget it itll even keep the rice warm if you actually forget itworks great
8825,1,i purchased  picture quality is crapjust not that good
4198,1,play video when i placed my order it brought  films and only  came outincomplete my order
7144,1,i was promised  packs of instant films when i only received  pack of instant filmsdisappointed
3715,1,buying this item was a total disaster for me i bought it for a job and in the middle of shooting on first use the light went off i tried charging the battery but it was not even charging it was really embarrassing not buying viltrox againuseless
5330,1,had a bad batch of film this is not the first time ive used this camera bummed my film is junkfilm issues
13557,5,i love zojirushi products they are simple and high quality i love my rice cookerhigh quality product
2961,1,i bought this item and half of the cartridges were damageddont buy it
4245,1,not easy to usenot easy to use
4847,2,its not worth what it cost it dont take good picturesnot good
5361,2,the product description is  this is not a packaged cohesive product it is a group of individual products some dusty and old thrown  as a whole what was delivered and the way it was delivered make this an extremely poor  what is pictured and described is not what was  the whole experience was super shoddyproduct description does not match what was delivered
6387,2,i already have a dash cam very similar to this one which shoots perfect hd video so i thought this camera would produce the same results it doesnt not close i tried each of the  resolutions and each time the picture was the same a high distortion poor quality video im sending it back im spending a little more money for an  hd not even close
7195,1,it was a great purchase at first a bit of a pain to put on but i finally got it secure and snug or so i thoughtevery time i shot the straps would start to come undone more and more one day it finally happened i was holding my camera in one hand and the straps came undone and my  fell thankfully i caught it before it hit the ground i really had faith in this thing i secured it and gave it a second try but nope camera fell again and i wasnt fast enough to grab it damaged my camera dont go cheap i regret ever buying this thingi never write reviews and i just typed out a paragraph here thats how you know its badit was great until it wasnt
2384,1,the photo quality is not good camera broke after only a few usesbad photo quality
3037,1,my daughter was so excited about this camera she got it for her birthday today and i set it up for her when we got home battery was charged quickly and i let her go take a few photos to get acquainted with it she brought it back to me to show me the photos i went to put it in the case and accidentally dropped it on the kitchen counter at most about a  fall from my hands and the screen went nuts and then it quit working altogether if it cant handle a minor bobble like that its not worth it and definitely not suitable for kids ive already started the return process i may update my review depending on how they handle the return however well be purchasing a different camera regardlessbroke in just minutes
11052,4,"i bought this product for  in august  so that i could easily make rice dinners in college usually rice with some vegetables that i steam above it has been a worthwhile investment that lasts me to this day here are some pros and cons of this productpros for a rice cooker is really cheap for the utility im getting out of itits quick and easy to use just add rice and water and optionally the steamer with other food you want to steam push the lever and wait for  minutesits compact yet makes more than enough rice to last a few meals  cups is a lot of rice for an individual college student like me and storing the rice cooker somewhere else when im not using it is easy since it is fairly lightweightit has lasted me for almost a year with regular usage and i believe that it will last me at least a few moreunlike another review complaining about the stability caused by the three legs i felt that this rice cookers stability was fine however i make simple rice dinners that only involve me preparing vegetables and adding them to the steamer rather than actually breaking frozen food in the steamer like the reviewer did interpret this based on how you plan to use the rice cookerthis rice cooker is easy to cleanconsi wish there was a bit more feedback to indicate that the rice is done cooking more expensive rice cookers play some sort of audio while this one just changes the indicator light and makes a click when the lever is moved back to the noncooking position i find myself often going back and forth to check when the rice cooker is done cookingthe cooked rice tends to become webbed at the bottom if you dont rinse out the starch well enough and it has mildly burned at timesits easy to forget to unplug the rice cooker when youre done even if the metal pot is no longer in the rice cooker it will keep warming if you dont do anything this seems like a safety hazard that is easily fixable with some audio feedback or an autoshutoff mechanismoverall this wont cook your rice as well as an expensive japanese rice cooker can but if all you need is a few cups of wellcooked rice regularly this is the product for you i took off a star because of the lack of feedback that is an inconvenience at best and a safety hazard at worst but this rice cooker will otherwise be able to meet your ricecooking needscheap rice cooker does the job"
4813,1,i used five cartridges of film trying to figure out why this camera was printing out black photos with grainy white spots i tried opening the film in complete darkness i tried different settings i tried different depths of field none of my photos came out which was infuriating i called amazon tech today and was informed to check inside the camera to see if a piece of black tape was covering the shutter sure enough there it was why would there be black tape covering the shutter i read all of the directions prior to use none of which informed me to look for a black piece of tape that would make it impossible to take photosblack tape covering shutter
273,1,i returned this the next day after receiving it it was poorly packaged and looked used i can not say that it was used i can say the feel and weight felt very cheap and i do not recommend this camera when it comes to something like a camera just purchase it in person that way you will not be surprised with well junkthe bad thing is that i really wanted it to be a great camera and it isntarrived broken
17085,5,"i finally used my instant dutch oven today and made braised turkey thighs with onions carrots potatoes celery and fresh herbs i seared the meat first put it on a plate while i browned the onions put the meat back in and added the veggies and broth braised it for  hours it took me a few minutes to understand how the settings work but then it was fine meat and veggies were perfectly done by the end of the cook time and it all tasted much better than i expected rich flavor and the sweetness of the carrots blended perfectly with the savory flavors soooo good the instructions book gives you enough info and the settings have enough flexibility that you can sort of do your own thing with a recipe and not mess up your food i was very pleasantly surprised its soaking now so ill soon find out how easy it is to clean this is a fun cooking vessel and i hope my success with cooking continues im single and dont cook very often i love cooking in cast iron and i love my slow cookers so this instant pot dutch oven is my favorite new toy if you love to cook in cast iron and love slow cookers you will love this pot update it cleaned up well after i cooked the first dish in my first review i didnt burn anything the second time i made a braised cabbage dish and because i wasnt familiar enough with the controls and tinkered with them too much the cabbage took a looooong time to cook and eventually burned on the bottom i was trying to slow cook on a high setting but had to go back to the booklet to find out how and the cabbage stunk up the house this all took so long that i had burned cabbage on the bottom of the crock i let it soak overnight and the pot actually cleaned up perfectly i used a nylon scrubby sponge and dish deterg with a bit of ammonia i was really impressed i was a little too adventurous with that recipe selection i wont do that again until i understand this cooker the stench cleared out of the house by the next dayif this is a new type of gadget to you read the instruction book first then enjoy"
4190,1,i bought  of these cameras for my grand kids ages  and  in august for their september birthdays they loved the cameras while they worked about  to  days issues  the battery will not hold a charge in either camera  a light stays on stating it needs more light but never goes off until camera loses charge after  secondsthese are not cheap so i would stay awaycamera has a short life   days
671,2,ive never had a problem at being able to get a camera to work i purchase a kodak with in a minute i was talking picturesunable to operate
3495,1, i was really looking forward to seeing my  year old daughter use her own camera and make cool portraits of our dogs and animals like shes always wanted to but it never happened after the first pack of film the developed film got stucksucked back in plastic was stud and she was scared to open it  therefore exposing itshe was in tearsall this after the original device was lost in transit a heads up for parents of creative and artsy kids just shop at target purchase the extra warranty and dont buy anything from amazonit doesnt charge or turn on id like my money back pleaseit broke after using it for two days ruined my daughters birthday surprise
6371,1,the video quality is awful and barely useable i got this camera after a car ignored the crosswalk and knocked me off my bike i figured if something like this ever happened again it would be good to have it on video this is not the camera for that i didnt need the picture to be cinema quality just clear enough to see whats happening and read a license plate at a close distance nope not sure how a  hd image can look so bad well heres a hint it is not  i set the camera to its highest resolution setting it claims its recording  x  but the video is actually recorded at  x  still a  video is technically considered hd but this video is definitely not hd its probably being recorded at a much lower resolution and then scaling the video to a higher resolution this is a common way a company can use a cheap cmos instead of a ccd sensor then use software to give it the same lines of resolution to claim its hd but if you start with grainy video and multiply the lines of resolution then you will end up with a grainy video thats been scaled up to look even worse its like the difference between digital zoom and optical zoomi can not say im totally surprised but for this to be even worse than my already low expectations is just sad i know it was only  but even a webcam that costs half that is capable of capturing a readable license plate at  feet of distancepicture quality is terrible
2359,2,cute retroish look easy to load and shoot then comes the picture and its terrible flash is auto and does work by work i mean there is a light that flashes but pictures come out way too dark too expensive for the camera too expensive for film just to end up with such a poor quality of pictures put your money towards a better digital camera or better yet just use your phone unless you have an iphone  i guarantee it takes better picturesdont bother
11091,4,i love this pot this helps me to make a quick lunch for the kids without all the hassle it does burn the rice a little at the bottom but its not that bad at allyessss
2101,1,the camera stopped working after about a month of use i got it for my sons birthday end of january we used it for a while then it sat on the counter for a couple of weeks after that it never worked again the film wouldnt come out and eventually the whole thing died im sending it in for repair now so ill see how that goes but its annoying that i have to pay to have it shipped out there when it just stopped working out of nowherebroke after  months
5975,1,nice camera and all though perhaps not spectacular considering we all have phones in our pocket form factor and connection options and waterproof being the top  features most of all this has been described ad nauseam by otherswhy do few report on battery performance it sucks you may be able to get  or a little more from a fresh battery and you will have to have that thing hooked up to the charger all the time off the charger without doing anything with it it is turned off this new unitbattery is at  after  days by weeks end at  that is ridiculous what good is a camera if you cant just grab and go with itnothing go and only a little pro about this camerano that battery performance is not ok 
6692,1,this product is a major refurb it feels cheap go to a drug store  buy the real one for  more the photos dont turn out well at all barely visible complete waste of money the film it came in was wrapped in saran wrap do not buy 
2223,2,after one maybe  session with the plug doesnt really work anymore i have to twist the cord for it to turn on like when a pair of headphones stops working unless the wires are twisted in the right way its really frustrating especially since i didnt do anything that would damage the cord or outleti was expecting more from this price point and the actual light box is pretty nice but if the plug doesnt work its basically useless and pretty horribleis it broken is this normal what can i do
6756,1,dont buy these or the camerapicture quality is awful
5375,1,delivered today but didnt come as explained missing a whole pack of film  not happy needed it for our trip not as explained
16769,5,"well i dont know if these reviews are real or fake since ive seen them exact same ones in another website and also i dont see this exact model cuckoo  in their cuckoo website to be honest it only appears in amazon and bestbuy when you google itanyways so far ive only used it once and it made flawless rice like advertised no complains so far looks really sleek for a rice cooker but will update soon the more i use it also it says  cups uncooked  cups cooked well i dont know how is this possible and i think is very misleading since that is what i was actually looking for anyways i will still keep it because of the looks and how well rice makes but to explain what that it means is this product comes with its own measuring cup and i guess thats how they measured the  cups which are actually half a cup of a regular american cup capacity so far i cooked only once and i used jasmine rice  cups of rice and  cup of water per cup of rice and it got to the top of the measuring ruler the inner pot has which i think that is the max raise of ricealso ive only washed it by hand and it looks very durable not cheap made in anywaysleek and good product so far"
10541,5,house warming gift nice color works so far and receiver satisfiedarrived quickly good size
2255,1,worst quality its like a hard plastic like material photo quality sucks you cant even even make this updont waste your time or money on thisyou get what you paid for
9078,1,excited to get my film so quickly however this film expired february  and it is currently end of june  if this was known beforehand i would not of ordered itexpired film
2287,1,it didnt last a week piece of junk stopped taking photos lens locked up not suitable as a paper weightcheap junk
13234,2,very pretty works fine except for the switch to cook sometimes easily slips to warm which means the rice doesnt finish cooking now that ive had the rice cooker for months i have to prop the switch on in order for the rice to continue cooking and monitoring is a must if you dont want the rice to burn the first rice cooker i received was missing certain items including the plug so i was sent a replacement and had to send back the first rice cooker a lot of inconvenience for a pretty rice cookerfaulty button
2802,2,just cheaphad to push button  times to take a photo cheap
2707,2,my daughter was really excited to use this after opening it on christmas but button to take pictures got stuck making it almost impossible to use the pictures also look really dark even in a well lit roombarely worked on the first day
8893,1, months old and had a charging prolbem from the start instructions showed what charge light looks like if charging correctly then a few days ago i checked on it after about  minutes of charging camera was very warmand batt so swollen had to work it out with small screwdriver dont buybattery swelled
11117,5,by far the best thing for cooking rice all you do is add the clean rice and water and turn it on it automatically turns off when the rice is done and is perfectmakes cooking easy
6037,1,i was embarrassed when i gave this to my grandchild turning  looks like a toynot impressedtoy camera
8394,1,i was so excited about this but it was a major disappointment the pictures had lines through them and the colors were extremely faded it got worse and worse the more i tried to print or edit the photos and seriously who wants to edit every single picture before printing it so it doesnt look as bad i read reviews of the other mini printers like this one made by different companies and it seems they all have the same problem with color and quality i highly recommend using mpix online to print your photos theyre cheap and extremely fastterrible printing quality
9398,5,it does what you think it does and does it well its a rice cooker and it does it well it makes soup and does it well its easy to clean and operateits just good
8146,1,initially i wrote this review about mediocre software but then the buttons stopped working and didnt get any support from drift so im dropping down to  stari bought this to use as a dash cam for both car and bike the camera has an event detection feature which will save incident footage to a separate directory on the sd card it also has dash cam feature which will overwrite older videos when the sd card is full the problem is that you shouldnt use these at the same time even though you can turn them both on in the settings after talking with the support team they told me to pick one not bothso you can either have event detection or continuous recording if you enable event detection the sd card will fill up and the camera will shut off or you can have continuous recording and risk overwriting an important bit of footageyou would expect that you could use both events get saved to event directory everything else is saved to regular directory only regular directory is overwritten when sd is full so you can keep recording until you are basically full of eventsi was afraid that i would have dash cam enabled get in an accident and not remember or not be able to shut off the camera the camera would keep recording and overwrite the accident or i would have event detection enabled have the sd card fill up and turn off halfway through my ridedriveafter trying with several computers each different oss i was unable to get my computer to recognize the camera i had to remove the sd card and use a separate sd card reader every time i wanted to download footagebuttons stopped working after only  months drift didnt respond to my request for support
4764,1,the led light was great while it worked ive had it two months and it finally died as you can see whether the power switch is on or off the charging lights stay on but the light will no longer turn on even when plugged in i havent dropped it wet it or abused it i know its not a very expensive light but with all the great reviews i thought it would have lasted longergreat until it wasnt
8161,1,fool my twicei bought a ghost x and as others here have reported it stops recording after  minutes every single time fortunately i was able to return it before the  day window closedthen foolishly i bought the xl figuring that maybe the different firmware wouldnt have the same bug well apparently it doesnt but there are other problems today i tried to connect it to my pc my mac using  different usb cables it doesnt work no indication on the camera pc or mac that there is any type of usb connectionaside from that picture quality is horrible not a single license plate readable on a bright sunny day using the highest picture quality settings on the camera it has a setting for generating thumbnail videos which cannot be turned off set it to off in the settings turn the camera back on its set to on theres nothing you can do to turn it off running the latest firmware the event detection will trigger lots of events on a normal ride eventually filling up the card with locked videos and stopping the camera from recording anything else i went on several rides which were not recorded before i noticed thisterribletotal junk avoid

14306,5,i always wanted a fancy rice cooker that i see in kdramas or cdramas this rice cooker seemed like it was easiest to use for me than most of the other ones out there i tried it for the first time yesterday when it arrived for white rice let me tell you ive always either use a pot on the stove or a cheap  rice cooker but thisthis it made my rice fluffier stickier which my kids love and doesnt burn at the bottom of the pot my cheap rice cooker did that when kept warm you could also keep the rice warm for up to  hours without fear of it burning at the bottom this is definitely worth the investment im so excited to explore more options i can make through the rice cooker like porridgeworth the buy
990,1,this was not at all the camera i thought it would be this is worse than the  digital cameras i bought in  the pictures were terrible if someone wanted to print a picture i cant imagine being able to decipher what the picture even was my boyfriend and i went on a vacation and try very hard to be present in the moment and like to leave our phones away as much as possible however i wanted a way to document the trip with pictures as i am a photographer by trade i wasnt looking for perfect pictures i would have brought many of the expensive cameras i have at home but i was looking for something decent this was not it  isnt a lot and i understand getting something good for the price but this was not worth  maybe  maybe for a kid to carry around it was lightweight and zoomed rather far but these are the only positives i can giveworse than the digital cameras i bought in

840,2,unfortunately after  months  its useless it stop working pictures were coming all white dont last
8436,1,no idea if this is a good product as the camera that you use it in kodak is a piece of junk no charger with it beyond difficult to load film and if you are lucky enough to get the camera to work u might get a picture to spit out after  mins junk camera and film

9073,1,not sure if this happened during delivery or if this pack was defective but i bought and saved the gold pack specifically for a trip to paris  they all came out awful  as pictured included pictures i took from a different pack the day prior that were fine so its not the camera or user error wish i had just bought them in person at a store since i couldnt get the one picture i really wanteddamaged
14776,4,i had bought an inexpensive rice cooker and this is not better than that one only thing i improved is the nonstick bowl versus an aluminum bowl this also takes a lot of room in the cabinet versus an inexpensive one why i gave this  stars it acts much like a pressure cooker with a seal that honestly tenderizes meat no more pounding the crap outta the meat with a hammermultifunction is great
2230,1,fotos way to smallsmall fotos
9463,5,our larger rice cooker broke so i decided to purchase a smaller less complex one this one is perfect for sitting on the counter and storing since its so small its a  cup capacity and we have maxed it out the rice came out just fine at the  cup capacity we are a family of  and only made  cups at a time in our last one so this one for the billperfect even for bigger families
2659,2,my daughter loved this camera as a christmas gift its simple to use easy for her to learn to navigate and takes pictures theyre not great quality but lets be honest for a  year old the fun is taking the picture not reviewing to see what it looked likeso why the low stars the first one we received froze constantly the reset button would usually do the trick to get it back going again but im talking every  minutes it would freeze let me tell you pressing a tiny offset reset button every  minutes because my daughters camera keeps freezing is not my idea of a fun afternoon nor is it hers we figured it was defective so we returned it and ordered anotherwell this one just got sent back too unfortunately after less than a month the camera will no longer power on without being connected to the charger  making it totally useless the battery seems to charge to  but then trying to turn it on while unplugged yields nothing not a beep not a light not a screen uselessthere are over  reviews here at  stars this tells me that either folks have had better luck than us and weve just been super unfortunate or that people review it after  days and never come back when theirs dies  i dont know which needless to say we wont buy this againif you do  good luck i hope your experience is better than minegreat kids camera if it worked
6631,1,flash is manual wth you have to open the flash when you want to use it there is no automatic flash otherwise i was expecting a pointandshoot camera this is not it fine if you are always taking pics outside and dont need the flash but when i want to take a pic indoors im not going to remember in the spurofthemomentletmegetthatpicture to raise the flash bulb going right back the product description should mention thisflash is manual  not a point and shoot camera
17508,5,i didnt realize i had it for this long we have probably used it at least ever other day it cooks white brown any other rice great as long as you follow the directions will buy it again if it ever fails however no slight signs of it yet it is worth the money highly recommendedstill great after  years
14088,5,"ive always used a steamer to make rice which usually did a good job but occasionally gave me undercooked or mushy results i really dislike singlepurpose kitchen toolsi have a small kitchenso id never considered getting a rice cookerthen we fostered an elderly dog who needed a warm ricesweet potato mashground lamb meal  timesweek and the whole steamer process was a pain a chef friend recommended this rice cookerwow you wash the rice stick it in the pot with some water and push a button  minutes later you have perfect rice and its kept warm until you need itand its not singlepurpose this also does my favorite cracked wheat and steelcut oats cereals for breakfast so that you wake up to a hot breakfast it makes congee and also cooks other grains including wild and brown rices pretty automaticallywe are eating a lot more grains these daysdont know how i got along without one of these"
2095,2,i got packaged which looked like it was usequality of picture
5903,1,i ordered and paid for a new item not used or refurbished but what i received was obviously a returned item it came in a box that had clearly been opened tape on both sides was cut and the camera inside had scuff marks on both sides i didnt even bother to turn it on i had purchased this as a gift and the condition it came in made it completely unusable avoidreceived a used and damaged item

17383,5,"i wanted rice wanted it done right easily and repeatable was going to do brown rice even though i like other rice better however the gaba brown rice is my goto and one of my favorites takes a while to cook but with the timer its easy stickysweet rice was perfecti figured if i wanted one machine to do rice as well as possible might as well have zero regrets and get this oneeasy to clean takes seconds easy to store mine sits on the counter all the timefor ease you can add frozen vegetables crack  eggs on top with it having about  minutes left on the timer best purchase ive made for a long timezojirushi support via email is great too they have a website for other grains that gives you instructions for other rice varieties they even replied with their unofficial quinoa ratio and cook setting  waterquinoa and white rice setting if you want a firmer texture use the quick cook menu settingreplacement parts are also available if after years you want another bowland seriously health whatever aside gaba rice is delicioussignedrice kingshould have bought this years ago"
3605,2,its always on even when you try to turn it off you cant charge it then pack it up for the next day the battery will be zero the only way i know how to actually turn it off is to take the battery out when you do have battery power it will drain very quickly ive not been able to use it for an hour yet as it drains the battery quickly even when you are not filming maybe its the display that doesnt turn off or maybe it is running the wifi at full power looking for a signal in the wilderness you cant even do a timelapse that has any length because the gopro is such a power waster i complained about this over a decade ago when i got the first model i thought they may have fixed it by nowonce you get some footage you may still be out of luck i was unable to copy files directly from the gopro to my computer using usb im not a fool i write the embedded software for devices like this you are supposed to let the gopro automatically download the files to the web where you then download them from there to you computer this can be an enormous amount of data worse yet its totally unreliable you dont find out until hours later that it failed or longer if your battery died during the process then what the quik app seems to be a third party application that is being phased out how are we supposed to edit video how do i access the sensor information that should be attached to the video how would i overlay that data why do the sensors even existthis is so frustrating the camera is very good but the software decisions have rendered it hardly useablebattery drains when not in use cant download videos quik is no good
7265,1,this camera has terrible image quality i dont know if its a manufacturing quality issue there must be some that work well but google gopro image quality and youll see a lot of users who cant get good quality images out of their devices i unfortunately have one that sucks ive tried using it several times under different conditions and different settings i also tried using the highest quality sd card no the advice of some users unfortunately at this point ive had the camera too long to return it or get a replacement ill never buy a gopro again there are many better optionsterrible image quality

501,1,i purchased this for my daughter for christmas and wasnt able to open it until recently it was refurbished and wouldnt accept a memory card then kept asking to restart the camera and since they have a limited window for returns it is a total loss a total waste of time and moneyworst camera
2213,2,everything was fine at first after a couple times of picture taking the lights began to shut off and turn back on i noticed the power supply was heating up so i had to disconnect it to cool down i was given some credit back to purchase another power supply thats fine and all but now my projects are on hold until i find the right power supply this is an inconvenience for mepower supply issues
6259,1,having tested it without the camera in yet with just a bit of running sprinkling i discovered an ugly thingthe seams are not tapedsealed and that where the water gets in very quickly also the actual fabric is not waterproof like your marmottnfcolumbiaetc rain coatyou would be better of repurposing your old hiking rain jacket and some duct tape frankly i can not understand what are all the great reviews all about i didnt expect a water proof pressurized tank but unsealed seams and cheap fabric is a joke although probably it would hold fine in a light drizzle for a short  session but so would my  weather sealinggreat product to test amazon return policy which is also great i  amazon
697,1,pictures are horrible quality  my iphone is  better also very difficult to use  like other reviews said its annoyingly bothersome clicking the button to simply take a photo and nearly impossible to focus the camera all the other buttons werent set up in a way thatd be useful for you to find the features youd use most often in an efficient manner not at all worth the  returned immediatelyso cheap

17617,5,ive used other models from the same manufacturer and they all work very well it should be noted however that the builtin timer uses a battery that can not be replaced by the user when the battery goes dead it must be returned to the manufacturer to be replaced as specialized tools are required the battery is hard wired into the circuit boarddoes a perfect job
4584,1,i bought one as a christmas gift and it only work for about  weeks a got a replacement and the second one worked for  month and again this one is not turning on and now there is no refund or replacementbad cameras

8692,1,the camera would not take a charge so only worked for about an hour then never worked againnot a good buy
13585,4,"worthless followed directions to the letter at least what was provided in the product we especially paid attention to quantity of water and rice after approximately  minutes the contents was boiling over spilling all over the counter unplugged and simply through the entire contraption and contents into the trash will stay with minute rice on the stove had great hopes but left disappointedout of pure frustration i took the product back out of the trash and gave it another whirl after reading numerous reviews regarding spill over while we had followed the directions note they are poorly written we noticed there were comments regarding the water to rice ratio a couple of reviewers indicated to put the same amount of water equal to the amount of dry rice so we did that in our case it was  cup of dry rice using the plastic cup provided with the cooker and  cup of water same plastic cup we noticed the the water level was right at the level of the rice this time  no overflow  in addition the cook time was very short  the rice came out great  no mess we have now cooked a number of servings of rice  both white and wild using the same formula worked each time therefore  i have adjusted my rating from one star to  stars did not give a  as this initial process was so daggum frustrating we like the productdisappointed  update"
658,2,i honestly was vey happy with all the bells and whistles i also didnt mind that it was so light in weight my biggest issue was the quality of the pictures they were poor qualityresolution and i was unable to utilize them especially from one platform to the other i was better off using my phone which i was trying to avoid if youre not really concerned about the quality of the images or if its for a kid its perfectpoor image quality
3840,1,wanted this to take simple pictures of stuffed animals for my instagram and the pictures are horrible quality i tried it on the highest settings as well and the pictures are still horrendoustakes very bad pictures
3940,1,i purchase the this item for my son straight out of the box the item didnt work we try taken a picture of the same item using all the different settings of the camera and all photos came out black we try taking pictures indoors outdoors in multiple light sources and the camera kept given us just black photos i reach out to the vendor to see if he can send me a new camera i will update my review once i get a response from themit doesnt work

5778,2,was not impressed by this camera i purchased for taking a mix of stills for my blog and some shots of family as well every single shot i took of a person or dog came out extremely blurry i tried every mode and adjusted the shutter speed and other settings in hopes i could get a decent shot no luck when i tested out the video feature i was also very disappointed in the video quality when i loaded it to my computer i found it was so grainy and of poor quality my iphone takes  better photos and videos than this camera if you are considering purchasing this canon powershot  hs i would honestly recommend purchasing another canon more in the low  range as those are comparable to the abilities of this camera this maybe works for other peoples needs but definitely not mine so i will be returning and spending more for what i needyou get less than you pay for

14750,5,my family loves rice this cooker makes it perfectly and it keeps it warm and fresh for a good stretch i can put a plate together in no time with the base rice perfection
6227,2,the companys youtube video is clear that this is for a large lens dslr standing on a tripod alas the amazon description doesnt say thati ordered this for my nikon  with a  lens this cover is way too big and bulky the lens strap doesnt work well which you can tell by the fact that there are so many questions on the amazon page on how to use itoverall if you have a large dslr with a large lens youll probably enjoy this but for anything else bewarecaution  definitely not for mediumsized dslrs or if youre not using a tripod
3466,2,im really disappointed in the quality the pictures come out i purchased this for my daughter  and its just not worth it its easy enough for her to use but it doesnt come with a charging cable photo paper is pricy and the quality itself makes me wish i didnt purchase thiseasy to use but terrible picture quality
7409,1,play video i ordered this a few months ago for my wedding that is next month i decided to finally open it up to see how it looks and works and the light just blinks super fast and does not take a picture i thought it was the new batteries that it came with so i ordered new ones and tried that and still nothing now of course im past the return date and worried if i order a new one it will do the same thing i searched online and it appears this happened to a lot of other people who purchased this camera so upsetdefective

2808,2,this camera will not snap a photo until the camera is happy with the shot it takes patience although i thought i had caught on to the delay and necessary green box i discovered that several shots i thought were captured were not captured also after clicking only about a dozen photos it totally froze the only option was to remove the battery on the plus side it is light weight and pocket size the photo quality is acceptable i would have been pleased with the camera if it had been a simple point and shoot when it froze i gave updifficult to use
5766,1,wrong sizeordered wrong size
7887,1,ive only used this a few times due to fact of the terrible quality of the pictures they come out very dark regardless of all the adjustments i made now its saying no paper when i just added some it is a terrible itempoor quality
17490,5,"i give this  stars because i know it would be exceptional based on my zojirushi   model which i sought to upgrade in size after reviewing the dimensions of the  version it seemed like this one wouldnt take up much more real estate on my limited kitchen counter i was wrong the smaller version enabled me to slide it behind another appliance while this version did noti encourage you to consider the zoji induction models they are outstanding for me the  model was perfect in terms of the counter space i have availableso much larger than i expected"
16884,4,i grew up eating rice cooked over clay stove and heat option of wood fire so when the pandemic hit i thought it could be my last chance to taste rice cooked in a modern rice cooker its ironic now with this new rice cooker that i could go back to enjoying plain rice with just soy sauce and a banana as in the poor old dayshitech rice cooker
968,1,i got this camera because of the reviews and i wanted to start a youtube channel but the quality is horrible it wont focus without the extra lenses provided with this product and when i use the lenses the quality is horrible i had to use a color corrector please dont buy and waste your money save up for a better cameraquality is horrible
17265,5,my fiance and i cook rice almost every day so i purchased this to make things easier i love it it is excellent quality it is very easy to use it cooks our rice perfectly every single time and keeps it warm until you are ready to serve other rice cookers we have used in the past have rice stick to the bottom this one comes our clean every time and is very easy to clean after use i definitely recommend thislove this
6044,2,the camera has a lot of great features but the picture quality is very poor kind of defeats the point of having a camerapoor quality photos
6193,2,i was out shooting when the skies opened up and it started raining fairly heavily at times so i finally had a chance to try this new rain coverit did a great job keeping my gear wet and i like that the zippered opening on the bottom made it easy to leave on the tripod as i was installing itmy main gripe about this thing is its somewhat awkward to install and its really hard to put on without disturbing the focus ring im actually not sure how you could manual focus with this thing installed anywayedit within a year or less the plastic window on the back got really cloudy and difficult to see through no amount of soap and water alcohol etc has cleared it up this thing has never been outside during the daytime and it was stored in a dark place so im sure it wasnt uv degradation just poor quality plastic breaking down over time the exact same thing happened to a friend i recommended this product tountil the plastic started breaking down it seemed to work okay
8314,1,rip off not sure if we just got the wrong camera but this is tiny and not as advertised it is for a kid but not a babynot the size as advertised it is   x   want my money back
15865,5,"play video i love this rice maker its my first one and its soooo easy to use all i did was add  cups of rinsed rice jasmine and  cups of water turned to on and that was it about  minutes later i had a full pot of fluffy rice it was perfect and delicious because the pot is nonstick the rice just fell out leaving an almost spotless pan the cleanup was super easy this will certainly be my new go to rice makereasy"

4914,1,this camera leaked on our first dive trip at about  feet  meters it didnt work at all it is a waste of money unfortunately because it was broken we put it in a hold on the dive boat and then forgot it we cant even send it back now what a piece of junkworthless camera

1719,1,out of about  pictures i took less than  were in focus and even some of those were not really crisp i should have just used my phone to take pictures with rather than wasting  on this camera if you want to get into photography or video making just save your money and buy a canon rebelterrible focus
12299,5,i sat on the fence about buying this for a while due to the price but am glad i got it i would say due to the countertop footprint and the price if you wont use it often it isnt worth it however if youll use it multiple times a month i think it is completely worth itworth it
1586,1,bought this  months ago and had problems with it freezing first i thought it was the sd card so i changed then i thought it might be corrupted files so i deleted basically nothing helped it started developing occasional lines across the display and now it wont even keep the sd in it basically spits it out i tried contacting seller through amazon and amazon responded with a message we are sorry to let you know that your messages associated with order id  cannot be deliveredthe seller associated with your order or inquiry has left the amazon store or is no longer able to receive any further email communicationsseller left amazon message so no communication
4408,2,i ordered this as a gift for my husbands birthday initially i was excited about it and then i set it up it essentially looked like cheap small computer monitor i set it up and had images loaded waiting for him as a surprise my concern was confirmed when he walked in and asked when i got the small computer monitor im pretty computer savvy and i found the software to be clumsy at best im really thankful i didnt try to use this as a gift for my parents or my grandmother it would have never gotten set up successfully i was also really disappointed in the image quality whether they were taken in my iphone or by a professional photographer the quality was pretty poor many images looked blurry and pixilated i read a lot of reviews before settling on this frame but ultimately returned it for  i expected more i turned around and purchased an aura brand frame and its beautiful truly looks like a picture frame image quality is the highest on the market and app interface  set up was seamless for a hundred dollars more it was worth the exchangedisappointed  returned
8563,2,i am trying very hard to fid good in this product i admit i am using it in linux and it was plug and play though it defaulted at  i had to edit the configtxt to set the resolution manually  off it is usb  only the picture is very clear yet very grainy if that at all makes sense it has a severe delay in mpeg formatlike up to  seconds delay and the focus is horrible perhaps in windows using software or if i try obs or linux equivalate that i can access setting to make it perform better but there is no way usb  is fully supporting  videonow on to the light it worked ok at first now it wont stay lit after  days of testing when it is lit it is flickering when the sun is shining through the windows and perfect this does pretty nice video but with indoor lighting it is horrible the picture is so clear and detailed you can see all the pores and stuff on my skin yet everything is also very grainy and noisyi really like how the base swivels and turns in all directions but it dont fix the fact that it lags so bad shooting video if i choose  the lag is much better but the picture is still terribly noise as the same as mpeg mode thats why i tried mpeg mode but the fact of not being usb  i dont see how it can transport  k video unless its super compressed which would explain why its so laggy and noisygrainyim really frustrated because i really wanted this to work out and leave a great review as i have for other products of theirs now i am not sure what to choose i want to return this and try the logitech bio im not sure what else to choose without stepping up to a dslr or digi camcorder ive been looking at go pros but for that much you ought to but a nice  digi camanyhow better off avoiding this cameravery dissatisfied
8032,1,the black film doesnt eject and keeps getting jammed i went through  cartridges and the same thing happened and it all went to waste bc of light sensitivity of the filmsfaulty product
2504,1,used the camera one time and now it is broken and the light on the front wont stop blinking cant take any photos and i changed the film and changed the batteries have no idea why the camera stopped working such a waste of moneydont buy
6446,1,the camera doesnt export the video format properly every file is unreadable and unusable weve tried the files on chrome books windows apple and no devices able to open the files it appears the video files are corrupt we tried various memory cards and reformatting the video cards and still got the same result in other words no computer will able to view the videos the video files are basically worthless ps i am tech savvyvideo clips dont work
3574,1,by far the worst customer service subscribed to cloud but could not get my phone number verified after so many attempts no online help to guide and nobody to reach for assistance cancelled the subscription but cannot get the refund so disappointingworst customer service of any top brand
9260,2,bought the camera for my daughter so she can vlog our vacation the sound is horrible it sounds like youre under watersound is horrible
1889,1,honestly a giant waste of money im so disappointed youll see three identical photos in this review one taken in daylight one at sunset in lower lighting and one with the flash covered to try to remedy the constant issue of super over exposure every single photo ive taken with this camera has turned out terrible unless taken indoors in low lighting and even then theyre not good and still over exposed this camera supposedly has auto exposure thats absolute crap i should have saved my money and bought the insta  with the manual exposure adjustments waste of money also definitely not an issue of film because this is the second pack ive triedterrible photos
17134,5,i have had this item in my cart for months but was waiting to see more reviews and for it to go on sale when it went on sale for cyber monday along with a lightening coupon i jumped and got myself a christmas present item arrived two days ago well packaged and in perfect condition i used it today to slow cook a chuck roast and it was amazing i was able to sear the roast deglaze the pan and then set it all to cook at a precise temperature rather than just fingers crossed on low med or high for  hours due to my schedule i had to wait until the last half hour to add the potatoes but i was able to quickly up the temp to cook them nicely in time for dinner everything turned out beautifully i did not think to measure the cooking temperature for precision but its on my list for next time so far i am in love with the stylish look but even more with the functionality of the unit i will use this for so many things i will update if that changes but for now i would definitely say go for itthis thing is the real deal so far
6928,1,i received a broken camera the lens will not retract at all also it has a scratch on the bottom corner this camera was most likely dropped by the former customer and was returned very dissatisfied and disappointed this item will be returnedbroken a returned camera
4666,1,it is simple to use but it broke after  uses and never read my sd cards again it overheated and got to hot to touch after being plugged in i dont recommend it if you are going to buy something similar buy one from a well known brand like sandiskit broke
5802,1,surprisingly this was not a good camera i purchased it mainly for the zoom aspect to use at my sons sports games i wanted to be able to zoom in on the playing field while social distancing nothing came out clear which is very frustrating i missed so many wonderful opportunities to take photos and videos most photos on any setting were blurry so disappointed because our iphone and samsung galaxy cellphones take better pictures trying one last time we took candid photos outside our home to capture us in the fall season colors but the camera never focused frustatedly my son said just let me use my iphone we did and the photos came out great sorry but i would not recommend this camerasurprisingly terrible camera
458,1,all i wanted was a camera that would shoot action and i could zoom easily this camera takes so long to auto focus it misses all the shots and the zoom even with the long lense is less than my phone canon should be ashamed of themselves for selling this piece of junkbetter off with a normal camera
18,5,works just like they shouldworks
12117,5,its expensive but its fantastic not much more to say the real question is whether you value rice to this price point 
304,2,this camera is huge its not convienant to carry around all day on vacationi sent it backtwo stars
8523,1,i followed the instructions for setting up the camera and turned it on before i could even take a picture the window that normally displays the number of pictures you have left read e for error and wouldnt work after doing some research i discovered there is nothing i can do to fix it because the e means either a faulty battery or lens  so needless to say i returned it and i was very sad to have to do so because i was looking forward to taking pictures with all the new features this camera offers i would recommend getting the warranty if you get this camera to avoid this problem further down the roaderror
6693,1,the camera does not workvery disappointed that my granddaughter had to receive a broken camera for christmas  
8515,2,took about  pictures with this camera loved it until we took a picture heard a pop and now the flash no longer works frustratingly happened a week after the return window closedflash broke
1010,1,when i first bought this product the first thing i did was plug it in after letting it charge for an hour i put my sd card in and tried to test out the camera aside from the buttons making little to no sense the camera kept getting frozen and the buttons would completely stop working obviously it is a cheaper alternative to buying and expensive digital camera so my expectations were not high but in all honesty i wouldnt say this camera is worth more then  dollars maybe i just received a dud but i was highly disappointeddidnt even work
5485,2,i have been using cameras for  years and i needed something with a long zoom and light weight the menu to get something to turn on or off can be a pain in the butt but overall its not a bad camera drawbacks can be the simple fact that if you miss a piece of dirt on the lens your camera might be focusing on the dirt instead of what you thought you wanted the picture of and end up with  photos of a spot of water on the lens instead of the nature at niagara falls also you might want to use a polarizer and have to find one small enough to fit this cameras threads on the lens i also hate the view screen in the rear of the camera especially in bright daylight i am so used to taking photos by the eyepiece and must learn to use the rear screen instead a bit of a learning curve i guess the end results might not be what i used to get from all my dslr cameras and lenses but i also dont have to carry many pounds of gear on a hike or for traveling as wellthe menu to get something to turn on or off can be a pain in the butt but overall its not a bad camera
8249,2,was excited to gift one of these to each of my daughters for xmas ordered two only one came with sd card so the other kid was not able to record video or save many pictures on hers big bummer avery durable and decent recording quality just no storagemissing sd card
8459,1,it didnt come with the rest of kit my daughter is upset what happened
3710,2,the light is more powerful at  than at  since i always use it at  is not powerful enoughlight intensity
5656,1,i bought this camera to make videos and take photos for my now closed online shop but i couldnt use any of the photos or videos because when i hooked it up to my laptop the footage had lines through it like a vhs tape that was worn out i tried editing it but it just doesnt work on the camera screen they look fine but not when uploaded to a computer im not sure if anyone else has had this issue but im really bummed i wasted  looks like bad vhs tape on my computer
513,1,this camera is the worest one i ever had no matter what is the set up on it still takes bad pictures my cell phone takes much better picture than this on what is the set up on it still takes bad pictures my cell phone takes much better picture 
573,1,stopped working properly you put batteries in and straight away it says they are depletedi have to send the camera back to america to get a refund rather than through amazonwhat a con 
8018,1,its not connecting to my phone anymore 
14261,5,its easy to use and store and we love itperfect rice every time
3487,1,i was so excited to use this product then i started to take photos they came out blurry and the color was way off i also stored it in my bag and it came apart there are three tiny pieces that help the camera eject the photo lets just say it is not worth the hassle of trying to put it back together even though the photos that i did take i hung up i cant help but laugh each time i see them because of the lack of quality i would prefer to get my money back and pay more for a camera that is more durable and take a decent photoinvest your money elsewhere
3613,1,this product wont and cant link to my iphone  its stays stuck on the setup section just purchase the go prodont purchase if you have an iphone
4917,1,bought this specifically for a trip we took where we planned to snorkel camera took a handful of pictures then stopped working now it wont even turn on called kodak and was told to email customer support two emails sent with no response dont buy this camera complete wast of moneygarbage camera
6695,1,very poor diseno the worst materialsthe worst thing i have ever seen
8729,1,i received after the feeling that this is a cheap chinese product and indeed after using the camerais not advertised  with the  cell phones are clearer than this too disappointed a waste of my moneynot worth the price
6945,2,dont even waste your money by the second use i couldnt even turn it on i even replaced the batteries and nothingthis is my second time purchasing this camera  both times it just stopped working completely im so mad that i wasted my moneywaste of money
5281,2,i got one of the defective ones unfortunately because it takes great photos for the pricebecause it takes great photos for the price
207,1,i just bought one of these big mistake the hot shoe is lacking a main center contact making it only able to use canon flash units you cannot even use a flash in manual mode because of this it also means that any kind of wireless flash triggers are rendered useless couple that with no interior contact pins for full interface with a battery grip and this thing is a waste of money my old rebel xs is way ahead of this new turd canon you let me down with this trickerya joke from canon
9128,2,i bought this as a gift for my son its just bad tech at this point and film is expensive boy dont buy thisway too expensive for photos
14270,5,i grew up in a household that ate rice daily for years i was antirice cooker convinced that people who complained about cooking rice on the stove simply didnt know what they were doing while i stand by that belief as i get older im getting lazy and wanting to be coddled by unnecessary luxuries thus i splurged on this rice cooker and let me tell you its the real deal the electric computer controlled slow heating of the rice really allows for a more precise cooking process than is possible on the stove the downside is that cook times are noticeably longer in the rice cooker than the stovetop  minutes for white rice and  minutes for brown rice this is offset by the convenience of preparing it ahead of time though you have to change habit of making the rice last as its the fastest to cook to starting the rice cooker before prepping your other dishes all in all if youve been comfortable cooking rice all your life the traditional way this is not quite a must have but definitely a very nice to have appliancetreat yourself
3819,1,this camera is poor quality and not worth the price we gave it to our  year old for christmas and its basically junk the picture quality is terrible it looks like we got it from the dollar store ill be returning if i can find the box in our christmas wrapping paper buy something betterbuy something else
3789,1,this camera after  months will not hold a charge and cannot even send it back for a exchange  waste of money  cant even use it will not hold a charge wont stay charged
3519,1,controls dont work cant get the memory card to format even in my computer sad cameracamera wont work card wont format
10505,5,very small footprint on the countertop makes  servings fast follow the amounts provided in the instructions and it makes perfect rice i got the aqua color its darker than the photo and matches my kitchenaid aqua mixer perfectly i love it excited to try steel cut oatsexcellent mini rice cooker
14871,5,efficient for a single persongreat product
3931,2,i ordered a teal color as it is my daughters favorite color we got pink instead the  pack of film worked fine all the pictures came out perfect the rest of the film that came with it were horrible none of the pictures came out rightcheck your order when you receive it
1813,1,stopped working right after warranty is totally hit or miss with taking photosstopped working
11190,5,a couple of notes on usability  the cooker is best for cooking a maximum of  cups dry uncooked rice with  cups of water and the measuring cup is an unusual shallow design unlike most other rice cookers but this helps with decanting when youre rinsing unboiled ricethe steamer lid is a great feature
3368,1,camera quality sucks worst camera ever will be returning but very lightweightdont waste your time
918,1,this is my second type trying to buy and inexpensive video camcorder this was a disappointment though the instructions were better feel and look of the camera is poor the plastic casing is inferior the best adjective is flimsy the video screen wobbles at hinges because the screen is so small touching the icons are difficult and i dont have large hands my recommendation bite the bullet and buy a name brand camcorder i also recommend that you check out camcorder in a store and purchase through amazon if you find one you likei recommend you not buyits flimsy
6616,2,liked everything about this camera except for the accessories i did not receive any of themfour  aa alkaline  usb   lens caphow amazon can sell a camera with these basic items makes no sensegreat camera no accessories
2064,1,all pictures turn out completely white i missed the return date by  days and now i have a camera that doesnt workdoesnt work
7780,1,not easy to use and seems it is going to fall apart soonmade very cheap
7791,1,i bought it for my nieces birthday and she never even got to use it it wouldnt hold a charge at alldont buy
2117,1, of  flashing lights system error and stopped working after  only rolls of filmstopped working after  pictures
9015,1,the sensor stopped working after  pics it was going to cost almost as much as what i paid for it to get it fixed waste of money live and learnsensor is garbage
10083,5,bought this rice cooker for my daughter and she loves it she puts in the rice water pushes a button and forget it the rice comes out perfect every time she used to cook her rice on the stove great for her family and apartment makes more than enough rice for them got it from the warehouse great pricecompact powerful easy clean
8035,1,i dont know what im doing wrong iv played with every setting auto filter no filter adjusted brightness contrast saturation downloaded photo editing apps to adjust white balance curves every single picture is either beyond washed out very dark and dull or some mud in between really wanted to like this thing but the print quality is absolute trash if someone knows how to get colorful vibrant prints from this  brick please let me knowphotos are washed out and dull
105,2,feels cheap and freezes all the timenot impressed
6542,1,save your money and buy something else the straps squeak with every step incredibly annoying id return but i missed the windowannoying squeak
8851,2,not worth a crapjunk
5911,1,camera arrived not working charged per instructions but never completely charged turned on and off two or three times and it wouldnt turn on anymore charged overnight and same problem next day very disappointed and a pain to have to return camera plus all the film i ordered and find something else to order in time for an event shouldve read reviews to learn that there are many negative reviews for this very same problemcamera not working and wouldnt charge completely or hold charge
6770,1,the brand for the telephoto and wide angle is some off brand that you can buy separately on amazon for  the tripod was flimsy would not trust it not to fall over with the weight of a camera im returning it very disappointedcheap unusable bundle
2849,1,terrible picture quality flash is just a light you turn on and doesnt help quality cheaply made not easy to use and poor battery lifedo not buy this camera
598,1,first off this camera has a speaker and makes noise with every action there is seemingly no way to turn it off and it is obnoxious second the pictures dont look the same as an older nikon coolpix which is what i wanted the flash on it is trash it is trash im returning it as soon as i cannot like the old digital cameras
14268,5,easy to use and what i like the best  it keeps time info even when unpluggedthe best reice cooker i ever had
1459,1,i have already retuned the product for a full refund  it would not work the camera would take one picture  than go into a fuzzy screen and stay that way  sorry it did not work out for mewas not for me 
14856,5,we cook a lot of rice at my home this makes it easy for my teen as well i love how easy it is to remove the pot and clean bonus with a measuring cup and scoop great purchasemake it easy
2620,1,this was on my wedding registry and i received at my bridal shower was excited to use during the wedding reception and honeymoon it stopped working during the wedding reception i thought because of the batteries it came with it worked during the honeymoon i just went to use it again and it keeps blinking new batteries did not fix the issue this timestops working
9618,5,"omg how much do i love this rice cooker i already have another aroma rice cooker so i am familiar with the brand which has served me well this new rice cooker is so much easier to use and clean much smaller footprint than the other one too i used it to make some grits this morning id found a recipe online for how to cook them in a rice cooker a while back i had to modify it somewhat use less water because i prefer to eat my grits with a fork not a strawi was a little concerned that the grits might pop out of the steam hole i know how i felt when one would hit my hand when stirring them using a pot on the stove top not quite al green level pain but better to avoid at all costs turns out there was no need for concernall i had to do was fill the pot with  cups of water and  cup of grits plug in and set the unit to cook and just went on my merry way when i came back into the kitchen about  mins or so later the unit had already switched to warm and my grits were close to perfection still think ill use a little bit less water next time i dropped in  stick of kerrygold pure irish butter gave it a good stir and voila next time ill add  cup of shredded cheddar cheese for my cheesy grits yumclean up was a breeze too as the pot is also nonstick and it took a whole lot less effort no cleaning around a gasket the rim the vents on the top removable inner lid no boilovers etc as i experienced with my aroma housewares  digital cooltouch rice grain cooker and food steamer stainless silver  uncooked   cooked which i purchased from amazon in  hallelujah thank you aromano regrets here"
13711,4,"i am bad at rice i do not know why but unless its in a pouch i will screw it up i picjed up this tiny cooker the plain model no keep warm option and it has been amazing tips if you also suck at rice  rinse the rice a lotlike  or  times to keep the starch from sticking  only use a rice cup that it comes from and the recommended water lines in the pot its less than a full  cup so it matters  do not forget the wait time  mins after it pops dont touch the lidi have made sushi rice jasmine rice basmati rice long grain brown rice and rice combos all with the same process and measurements with no issues its not perfect but it is so much better now "
1486,1,never worked came brokendo not buy this camera
7352,1,awkward to use and doesnt work as well as advertised returned immediatelynot useful
1860,2,by the time i got to my second film cartridge the camera started printing blanks and i mean milky white blanks not even fuzzy or gray or cloudy that orange light comes on flashing and i wasnt even able to take more pictures ive only had it for a week absolutely dreadful not to mention its impossible to reach the manufacturer and the batteries they sent it with didnt even workblah
11051,4,"i use this product very frequently around  or  times per weeki have used it to cook rice and quinoa as well as to steam cauliflower and sweet potatoesthis is the only rice cooker ive owned and as such i dont have anything to compare it to however i have to say its quite nice perfectly cooks white rice and quinoa the only things ive tried thus far and the steaming function with the steamer basket works just as wellnow i cant say that the issues ive had are exclusive to this cooker and i dont even consider them to be huge issues the steamer basket is stained orange from steaming sweet potatoes is that normal i dont know but it isnt a huge deal it just makes me wonder if the plastic they used for the steamer basket is maybe a bit too porous if you try to cook your ricequinoa in broth you are going to encounter a few problems these arent really problems with the rice cooker but they still warrant consideration the broth is going to bubble and boil off much faster than plain water that means that its going to make a mess and if you use only broth you will undercook your rice if you go by the directions i recommend using the regular amount of water and adding some broth as extra the cooker does not cool down fast enough to not burn the rice i say burn in quotations because some people like the crispy rice i do not not actually a problem i have experienced because i have been avoiding it but i have a feeling if you try to cook the maximum amount of rice that this cooker can hold  cups you will definitely overflow the cooker as it boilshowever the way that the cooking dish sits inside of the cooker prevents the liquid from damaging the electronics i typically put a kitchen towel either over to stop the splatter or under to catch the splatter the cooker this helps prevent messesoverall this is a great first rice cooker for me it requires very little input or effort and cooks the rice perfectly minus the crispy edgesworth every dollar"
915,1,honestly there is no way this is a  megapixel camera the video quality is abysmal given as a gift so the return window has closed for me and im feeling lied to and ripped offhorrible quality
4743,1,worked for about  months then just completely stopped working wouldnt charge anymore not with the cable it came with nor with any other cables we hadpoorly made not worth it
2194,1,three major design flaws first the leathervinyl backdrop is folded when shipped and for storage this results in a crease in the material causing a line in the backdrop you can edit out the line with photoshop but for the cost this shouldnt be necessary to fix this the unit should have the backdrop removed and rolled up two the sides are not strong enough to hold the unit up alone this means the sides will slightly cave in making the backdrop uneven again resulting in something that can be fixed with photoshop but why and lastly the lighting is not well diffused this will cause a glare on anything that might show a reflection the overall build and materials are great but the lack of a good backdrop and ability to properly store said backdrop are why this unit is only worth  starpoor design
13108,5,i love my rice cooker it is a lot like my old one my ex husband stole being a island lady got to always have your ricerice on
7303,2,i got the camera and i thought it worked fine but then just a little after having it for a month it stopped working i know i didnt damage it it just randomly shuts off on me i do make sure that the battery is charged etcstopped working after a month
161,1,i had to return this camera it is way to complicated some reviews said it was a beginners camera and it is not i have been using cameras for  years started with a pentax manual that took film was so glad when digital camera came as i had put so much money into film and develement i had a cannon powershot for  years that i loved but it died i decided to upgrade to the rebel as i had used a friends and liked it the one i bought did not even seem like the same camera way to much complicated instructions to do the most simple things charged battery put in a new memory card took  photos and camera told me card was full normally i can get  to  photos on a card depending on how much vidio i take which usually isnt that much i prefer taking stills i have never had a problem with a memory card but you never know i put in another card that was new and a different brand same thing  photos and camera said it was full this was not good i put those photos on computer and was disappointed with the quality i could have done just as well with my cell phonethe zoom on the camera seemed to have a problem too it would take  to  seconds or more to auto focas on what i wanted to take a picture of with still life or flowers or sceanery i would get the sakes by the time it would focas i could find no way to turn off the auto focas even putting it on manual and sports did not do any good that ment if i was trying to get a shot of something moving it was long gone by the time the auto focas did its thing tried to call cannon support no answer emailed them no answer i gave up on this camera and sent it back sure not worth what i payed for itreally bad camera
2872,1,at the price this is great for kids my two year old son loved his cam cam unfortunately they fail pretty quickly our first one after five weeks was showing very distorted images shortly after youd turn it on take one picture and it would freeze you couldnt even turn it off youd let it die charge it up and again only get a picture or two until it freezesnow we bought a second one and in less than a week it is going through the same freezing process only this one freezes with a blank screen the power light is on but there is no input we again have to let it die charge it up and start overgood for kids but doesnt last
2758,1,i purchased this for my birthday party to take photos come in and it didnt work had to return it cant say if it was a good camera or not cause it didnt workbomber
4535,1,connectivity and support are not worth the hassle stay with gopro for a better experience and significantly better user experience this is a waste of your moneypoor quality poor experience
5372,1,battery life doesnt last long and doesnt come with much information on when the light blinks or loading the film priced to high for purchasebattery life
2519,2,i left this battery charging for hours after it suddenly turned orange or low battery i waited for the red charging light to turn off then i began using it again less than ten minutes later it was already back on low batterybattery is terrible
4664,1,it wasnt compatible for half of my drivesmicro sd cards thats not all it kept corrupting multiple video files when viewing or playing them through allll of my micro sd cards ugreen has great quality i really like their aux cords they cant make these though they suck at it i would have rather purchased a no name brandhad to return because
8579,2,i paid two times the price for this camera and would not focus with a close up id check dont waste your money the light heats up quickly and gets hotlight gets hot
1403,1,i would not recommend this camera for a content creator because the pictures and videos do not show up clear very poor quality i will not recommendnot for a content creators
7744,1,i sent this back its like for american girl dolls its so tiny my son is  no way it would last long it would be mistaking for a toy not a camera picture quality was very fuzzyway to small
2170,2,after trying every way to get a white background i still waste time retouching every image at first it seems like it can do the job very well but when you start working with the booth youll notice a few  no power onoff  the front three window openings are loosely secured and get in the way they are magnetic and get detached very easily perhaps stronger magnet could do a better  the white drop is great with the exception of  light setup and strength is very  pictures do not come out with a white and bright background but rather grayish i am using iphone  and have no luck with my photos i need to manually adjust brightness level which defeats the purpose of having such an expensive box or get an additional lightdo not expect photo to come out with white background
8717,1,it didnt work when it arrived i sent it backupdates    the company offered me a  gift card to take this post   the company offered me a  gift card to take down this   the company offered me a  gift card if i take down this   the company offered me a  gift card to take down this postdidnt work
1112,2,i already have a  digital camera that works fine however i was attracted to this one because it was advertised as  i guess that applies to video because the picture quality sure wasnt as good as my  camera besides its twice as large  bulky as my current one also  as far as the  part goes  i already have a gopro  as well which takes terrific video  yes  i realize that its more expensive as wellnot recommended  get a good digital camera  save up for a gopropoor picture quality vs a  camera too big  bulky vs gopro 
3602,2,we use a lot of the gopro cameras pretty much daily they take great images this is true but to make the statement that the gopro  black is waterproof is false we have three of them and two were ruined by fresh water one damaged from simple rain hitting it on a boat mount and the second stopped working when it was submerged for two minutes in two feet of water not a user error made sure the battery door was shut tight and locked be warned many people are saying the exact same thingnot water proof
3479,2,cute idea and ok for my  year old but the viewfinder doesnt match what prints out so you waste so much paper just trying to get something in the center and the colors are sooooooo off unless you are in sunlight i wouldnt get it again too bad if the pictures remotely matched the viewfinder and the color wasnt awful would be a fun camera but its too awful honestly cant believe that a company would sell something that doesnt work that well disappointedfun idea but horrible quality
6041,1,purchased as a gift did not arrive on time amazon marked as delivered which it wasnt when i contacted them that it was not received they sent againbut was further disappointed when we opened it instructions are confusing and incomplete it references music but there is no way we could get that function to work directions also reference parts that arent there and very cheaply madevery unhappy
6885,2,we bought this camera to take pictures of patients wounds and it is horrible the pictures are very grainy and you can not adjust the camera at all to make the picture betterdissapointed
6030,2,this is very small the parts that come with it are a bit confusing and i cant figure out how to use the music function not sure how easy it is for a child to use if i cant figure it outvery small
6966,2,i have had this camera for  months and after using this only a handful of times it has just stopped turning on tried replacing the batteries re installing the batteries numberous times and done just about everything i can to this camera to get it to work seems to have died for good on me real bummer because i dont want to spend another  on another its made poorlynot made to last

5558,2,my sister got one of these cameras from another retailer and i thought it was such a cute idea so i bought one myself got it the day before christmas for a party i was having on the  and took some pictures for that it worked at first then as the night went on i would turn it on and go to take a picture and nothing would happen the little red light on the front would just flash repeatedly so i would turn it off then back on try to take another picture and after doing that twice seemed to make it work again i tried using it again a week later on new years and it would do the same thing take a few pictures then stop working turn it onandoff twice then it would work but this time it kept doing it every time i turned it off for any extended period of time it would not work until i turned it offandon a few times i tried to use it a couple weeks later and it just would not work i turned it off and then back on at least  times and it would not take a picture only the little red light on the front would flash a bunch of times for how much this thing cost an how expensive the film rolls are i am very disappointed in this productstopped working almost immediately
13763,5,i love this rice cooker i bought two of them one for myself and one for my daughter it is so easy to use you just put the ingredients in it and push the cook button when its done it goes into the warm cycle no timing to bother withthe machine knows when your rice is done i love it ive had mine for several years now just purchased a  one for my daughter highly recommend itlove my rice cooker
1729,1,one the item arrived late scratched and has no lens cap but thats not why its getting one star its very cheap feelingi compared it to my  year old pink kodak digital camera in the same price point and this weighs a fraction the photos are not sharp lets just say they dont make things like they used to guess if you came from a generation where cell phones replaced cameras this toy might be for you while the the zoom capability is higher picture quality was not better than my iphone pro which is much easier and more useful to have on your person this is more so a novelty item than a quality camera maybe a fun gift for a kidtwo weeks after ordering i received a post card offering me a  gift card in exchange for a  star review this may explain why its rated so high for such a pos hope i still get the gift card for sharing an honest opinion and keeping it  if they can pay  for a review the camera cant cost more to than loose change to make either spend a few hundred more on a nikon canon etc or just use your phone i returned it this camera is crapdont bother
2221,2,quality look good love the foldable construction but the built in led color is just not good lighting is not even too we uses nice cameras but a lot of post work is needed in photoshop to adjust the lighting you will not get a professional light box look out of this light box if you do not use photoshop would not recommend this product at all a diy paper box we built previously with lamp coming from each side through a translucent fabric was better than thisquality look good love the foldable construction
1425,1,purchased as a gift shippingdelivery was only positive i can say product appears quality from distance but up close very cheaply made the  time being used the tripod broke inside camera used anyways and all pictures were so dark you couldnt see them the parents reviewed everything and did researchtroubleshooting to no avail and ended up throwing it away i cant return it for a refund since its trashed no stars or recommendations from this dissatisfied gift giver who lost  twiceworst product ever
5991,1,i personally love the gopro camera i have a hero  however their customer support is horriblewith my initial purchase of the gopro hero  i purchased a media mod when i tried it it would only record through the internal microphone you couldnt hook up any external microphones because it wouldnt recognize them i called gopro support we walked through the issue and then said that i needed a replacement i sent back my media mod and almost  weeks later i finally received my replacement oh yes it almost took  weeks to receive my replacement but wait the replacement i received was a media mod for a hero  and it was used their were scratches all over it and it looked visually used even the numbers in the external flap where you insert the gopro was worni contacted gopro and after back and forth communication which took a couple days they said they would send out another one that took another  weeks to receive so now were into just over a month and a half of this i finally receive the package and guess what oh you guessed it its another media mod for a hero  so  now i have  media mods for a hero  but remember i have a hero  i got off the phone with their support team and they said that id have to first return both of the media mods i received which were incorrect before they would send out my replacement supposedly for my hero  but wait the other customer support person i spoke too weeks ago didnt have me do that actually she said she wanted me to hold onto the ones i received until i received the correct onehowever last night the person was so completely apathetic she couldnt care less that i have been going back and fourth with gopro for over a month and a half at this point she couldnt care lessi wanted to take my gopro on a trip im taking but again i need to have the media mod with the external microphone ability the woman last night couldnt care less i have been going back and fourth for almost  months she could have cared less that im going on my trip she was literally lacking concern and basically just wanted me off the phonei can not express how abysmal their customer support is and the lack of concern and care they have for you as a customer omg and just to have some context im not the kind of person that returns things i actually was going to just purchase another media mod brand new so i didnt have to get into returning i cant stand returning things but i didnt want to have to spend another  dollars on another media modhonestly i wish there was competition for the gopro because honestly its not worth the effort should you need to have something returned good luck these people do  not  care like literally no concern whatsoever for the money youve spent the time you have to take to go through the effort of returning its almost like their model is to make it sooooo frustrating to return the item it would just make sense to just purchase another item but you know what i have had such a horrible experience with gopro i will never ever purchase another gopro item everand i know the company doesnt care because they are pathetic with their efforts to satisfy their customers horrible experience im only writing this to everyone to second guess your gopro purchases if god forbid something doesnt work know that these people do  not  care so you might want to look at other options before purchasing a gopro omg i have never dealt with a company with such apathy wowso im sending back both my media mods which are for a hero  and im not holding my breath at all with when if ever ill receive the replacement that isnt used and actually works for my hero  if anyone can suggest a camera that competes with the gopro that doesnt have these customer service issue please let me know so heading into the second month with what was originally a very sincere request to have something replaced with never worked from the get go that i guess was a futile effort patheticlove the camera hate their customer support
4281,1,i have  camera bags and  pelican cases most of these bags were purchased for my nikon ff bodies lenses and speedlights i recently purchased a fuji  and the camera bags that i currently have are way too big for the camera body so i started to look for smaller camera bags that would fit the fuji  with the   nikon  and a  prime with an adapterfirst things first is this bag is dirt cheap in terms of the price so i wasnt expecting much in reality the bag is not to bad quality wise and the size is just right for the fuji  and a couple of lenses so upon initial inspection i was pretty happy over all that is until i opened the camera compartment much to my displeasure i quickly noticed the defective stitching i immediately new i would have to return the bag  i grabbed my nikon  prime and it would not fit in the bag due to the defective stitchingi have attached a couple of photos showing the defect i will probably end up purchasing the newer brand of this bag instead the newer bag also has a rain cover and another compartment to put a lens pen along with a microfiber towel to clean lenses etcin summary if the stitching was not defective i would have gladly kept the bag and given this bag a rating of  out of  stars given the price point of this bagpoor quality control
6324,1,i bought this camera for my daughter camera worked only for  month and since end of april  it is sitting deadnot satisfied with purchase

3868,1,i love panasonic and when i got a very good price for this camera i got itthe camera looks good and is easy to use but picture quality and especially the focus on this camera is not there it takes almost a second sometimes to focus and the camera seems to be very slow if you use the stacking option or busterfast mode is ok but you cant do that on every occasion the menu is simple but some options are inactive in some menus the extras on this camera are very nice but without a good focus you cant use the camera at full potential shame panasonic for not having a decent focuslove panasonic but not 
10452,4,"this little cooker would be helpful if you dont have a stove cooktop available as it does boil liquids to cook some things in small amounts for cooking rice you definitely have to get your ricetowater proportions just right which took some trial and error even following the directions to a tee i used the directions for white rice on page  the first few times but the rice was overcooked mush and had begun to stick before the cooker switched from cook to warm i finally got better results by watching it and unplugging it while it was still on cook when i heard it start to sizzle and stick although that defeated the purpose of using a rice cooker the last batch of rice finally turned out well without any intervention i used  dash scoop of jasmine rice and  dash scoop of water but i did not rinse the rice that time i think the amount of water must need to be reduced if you rinse the rice as directed or else it overcooksthe included dash scoop holds  fl oz or  of a standard  measuring cup the cooker held  dash scoop of rice and the added water to just below the  line on the pot water added after the rice had been put in as per page  after it started boiling it overflowed through the steam vent in the lid but did not overflow the sides of the pot therefore i think that is about the maximum practical capacity unless you want a mess the overflow made the lid rim a little hard to clean although it wasnt really a problem nowhere does it say the cooking pot insert or glass lid are dishwasher safe so i didnt put any of the items in the dishwasher of course the electric base isnt submersibleunlike page  page  gives amounts in standard measuring cups but i dont think it would hold  standard measuring cup of rice plus enough water without overflowing the sides as several reviews have noted also a couple of the included recipes are too large for the pot the manual needs a little workat  watts its going to be a little slow to start boiling taking from  to  minutes to start depending on the volume of water i used for most things i think it would be easier to just cook them in a saucepan on your cooktop if you have one available rice can be tricky so its probably good for that once you figure out the right ricetowater ratio to use it can make enough for one or probably two people families would need something largerlike the other tiny dashes it is cute i have the white one and it doesnt use much counter or storage space it seems well made it could also be used to cook a small amount of something else that mainly requires boiling in a liquid it might be safer than a cooktop for someone who gets distracted or is forgetful as it should switch to warm if the water boils out the included  cup dash scoop and the nonscratch utensil are usefulhandy if you dont have a cooktop available"

922,1,used a sandisk imagemate micro sdxc  card with adapter when i went to film the playbackaudio was jumpy incoherent and just really disappointing still waiting on my question to be answered on the page for comparability confirmation but it didnt specify in the manual not to so i will be buying a different sd card in the future for it so well see if that changes anythingterrible quality
11110,5,fast  easyworks well
6055,1,poor quality and very small very buy may send backsmall and awful
5727,2,i usually buy this for my camera and i never have a problem with it this time i decided to buy the photo paper with the colored borders well when i received the package it all looked fine it was when i actually used the photo paper it did not print with the colored border i was really looking forward to this colored border photo paper because i was going to use it for my sons birthday party which is in less than a week it was a rip off i wish i could contact the seller at least but i cant find their contact anywhere im so disappointedno color on the colored border
5994,1,it shoots great video when its working mine is brand new and getting the touch screen to work is enough to drive you mad it simply doesnt work unfortunately you need the touch screen to set everything up for the cost of this camera you would think it would work as it should do not buy this youll be missing the perfect shot painstakingly fighting with the touch screentouch screen nightmare do not buy
1703,1,do not buy this product when you try to transfer your photos onto your computer the quality is terrible and when you reach out for help they will not help youwaste of money and time
8407,1,the camera these goes with really sucks so these are not worth the money you will waste pictures trying to figure out how to center a photo because the camera does not take the picture centered the quality is low they advertise that you need to use bright colors to get the full quality of a photo i used crayons colors and it looks like i took photos in a dungeon theres also a blue and yellow streak that has run along all of my photos so far not sure if thats the paper or the camera do not buynot sure if its the photos or the camera either way not worth it
4995,2,my daughter was excited to take pictures with her camera but was disappointed that the film sporadically works they arent cheap and its a big waste to take pictures and not have them develop correctlyfilm does not develop
15,4,its good enough for the price i paid but super slow charge compared to the one that comes with iphonephone charger
12724,5,i first purchased this rice cooker for a new restaurant we were opening and needed a cooker that could do multiple grainsstyles of rice for the price  at the time i couldnt pass this up it worked splendidly until someone broke it so i immediately went to purchase another one and this one had a  off coupon score loved it so much i bought one for home ive used all types of cookers and for the money spent this walks that perfect balance between cheap cooker why bother just use a pot on the stove and the super high end cookers  i find no fault in it easy to clean cooks great and even keeps rice warm for over  currently have gone  without burning or drying out if youre in the market for a new rice cooker just buy this one and be thankful at the awesome pricebest value rice cooker out there
6040,1,came on time easy to use picture quality and lighting for pictures is the lowest grade possible nowhere near  quality cant see images in pictures or videos yes its for kids but have seen and used better camera for adults that holds up just as good for same price and takes  times better picturesright for the price
6520,1,this is not enough light to light  cubic foot might be ok for a tiny light box dont waste your money unless you only have a very small place to lightdont waste your money
2807,2,got this for my sons christmas gift it looks great and light weight and we had high hopes there is a serious lag when taking pictures it takes a few seconds between pressing the button and the photo taking the videosound quality is poor when you playback a video you can barely make out what youre saying as the sound quality is terrible would not recommend this cameraquality is not good
8315,1,camera was working good at first but when when the battery died i tried connecting it and the charger port pooped incamera isnt good quality
9460,5,"first of all i love the size of it its cute and compact i havent even started cooking rice with it yet the first thing i cooked when i opened it up was steel cut oats you know the kind that you have to constantly stir for  minutes so that none of sticks to the bottom and is impossible to clean after this gadget is set it and forget it comes with a  cup measuring cup so you can be exact with measurements the indicator lines on the inside tell you exactly how much water you need because lets be honest cooking rice is an exact art you need the exact amount water with the exact amount of food so this is fool proofanyway this cooked my steal cut oats to perfection i switched it on turned on the tv and it about  minutes i has perfectly cooked oats i cant want to actually cook rice with it it also comes with a scooper which is great the nonstick surface makes it all come out completely cleanlast time i cooked rice in a pot i was babysitting it for forever and i still burned some of it it left indelible black marks on the bottom of my pot never again i dont know how i went so long without thisgame changer"
1714,1,play video i hattters that it came with a broken usb port inside the camera bad look  dont recommendit came with broken usb charging part on camera
5934,1,lens is super blurry prints are super blurry when you speak to amazon support they have no clue what they are talking about sending this back asapdisappointed
2080,2,missing items missing  of the  film packs that were advertisedmissing items
2804,2,glitchy to use and photo resolution poor theres no way this is  mp maybe it wasnt fair to expect anything better for the pricelow quality
5587,1,i would not recommend this item for anyoneterrible picture quality
12718,4,im biased on rice cookers bc i love my fancy and pricey zojirushi ive used their products for decades this cosori does a lot in a smaller footprint and big volume so many settings and easy to follow instructions i got this as a secondary cooker and love italmost perfect
7895,1,i bought this printer as a gift for my niece across the seas in jordan unfortunately she could not even enjoy it even once the printer keeps flashing red and never prints anything i contacted their support team and went through all steps of resetting the device but it never worked what a waste of time and effortunreliable
4390,2, for a piece of screen i could get a decent tablet for that price which does so much more app is so bad cant really control anything just send a pictures i hate pictutes but my girlfriend loves them so i got it for her for v day and after finally i got myself to set it up i went through years of pictures picking up the ones she would like i picked  i found worthy out of thousands then it told me the limit is  and everything was just big waste of time couldnt it tell me that before i spent eternity on itfor me thats how it felt and as i said app is useless its huge not just the screen i have nothing to compare it with and this one was recommended on so many websites but i rather buy decent tablet for that price i hope i can still return itnot worth the price
1496,1,horrible quality of pics returned itbaftwr my  useone star
597,1,the one thing it had going for it was the color it feels cheap but it was a kids camera it first started with the inability for the wristband to actually fit through the very tiny hole provided by the designer should have been the red flag to send it back but my  old was thrilled with her camera the picture quality is poor but my daughter didnt mind it took the camera forever to charge but i thought maybe that would just be the initial charge but it wasnt then after a week the camera went completely on the fritz it would freeze and youd have to take the battery out she couldnt review her pictures then it just stopped even taking pictures it was a  camera and i was expecting more however it was more like a dollar store quality camera save your child the disappointment waiting to hear back from the seller to see if its covered and thankfully i did get the protection plan so hopefully one of the two will honor the returnexchangemoney backdisappointing
10548,5,i love this it makes enough rice for two and its so easy to clean its adorableso cute and small
9013,1,all my photos are stuck on my camera ive spent nearly a full day  hours trying to figure out how to download photos ive owned many cameras in the past all were very straight forward got the basics right this one has a huge problem  cant download to mac the photos youve taken extremely frustratingi cant download photos
1435,1,camera didnt work from when i opened so madhorrible
36,4,i should have paid closer attention the side pictures show it with a wall wart but it does not come with one a bit deceptive i think now i have to deal with a usb cable anywayno wall wart
5403,2,what pictures i could take was very blurry does not hold a charge cannot save pictures to carddoes not work correctly
7816,1,im not sure what i expectedbut this album is a  cent flexible binder with a plastic photo paper the photo slots are too small for instax filmcheap
7921,1,this camera quality is no good im better off using my android phone for videos and photos this camera sucksbad quality
14107,5,firstly the sea green color is an attraction coupled by the perfect size for a small family the rice cooker is shaped beautifullyperfect size and very efficient
5875,2,i got this for a vacation i havent been on yet first got it and loved it went to pack for said vacation yesterday took one photo turned it off now it wont turn back on its been charging overnight the light is still red chatted for help and jumped to sorry it cannot be returned like ok thanks i just want it fixed ugh mind you my  return was up the day i find this all out and chatted for help still waiting on a response for replacement ok
11096,5,i had a bigger one but i wanted a smaller size so i wouldnt waste food also a small one like this is easy for me to lift as i have mobility and strength issues this rice cooker just may be my most favor small appliance in my kitchenperfect appliance
15470,2,for the first few uses this worked beautifully unfortunately after those first few the pot started peeling and the rice scorching on the bottom despite following care and troubleshooting directions customer support is completely unresponsive and theres no way to easily buy replacement parts or check on the warranty incredibly disappointed because this is a robust little machine otherwise i bought this in november  it started having the issues by january and now its may and support has still not replied to multiple emails despite the positive reviews for machine that costs this much just look into another brand with better support or a cheaper machine you dont mind replacing in a yearunresponsive support not long lasting
5972,2,while the camera works and does what it does well i was going to use it as a moto vlogpov vlog camera and part of my setup is to have an external mic plugged in through the gopro brand  mic adapter unfortunately i learned after the fact that the gopro hero  black does not work with their own adapter after their last firmware update  so if you want to use an external you would have to get their media mod piece problem with that is the cage that i bought to hold the gopro which is meant to hold the  microphone adapter doesnt accommodate the bigger size of a go pro with this media mod thingtldr the gopro hero  black is not the camera you want if you are trying to use your old adapter and external microphone you have two choices spend the extra to get a gopro hero  blacki have personally confirmed that it is  compatible with the mic adapter using a purple panda lavalier mic or buy the media mod for another  plus try to find a compatible cage for extra protection which im not sure even existgopro  is not the move
11229,2,not impressed rice comes out like sticky wall paper pastesticky rice
17444,5,"this is the best rice cooker ive ever owned that being said its not really a quick rice cooker and thats fine by me just need to plan accordinglyive recently started sprouting brown rice in the past making any brown rice it turned out miserable with this cooker it was fantastic it takes  minutes to cook two scoops worth though as far as im concerned it was well worth iti am glad i got this cooker it is easy to use just add rice using provided scoop one scoop is not equal to one cup add water to matching number line press menu button to type of rice and youre setand it plays a song for you whats not to likethis makes the best rice i have ever made"
10068,4,overall the cooker does cook rice pretty well and i also steam dumplings on top of my rice which turn out pretty good the only thing i dont like is that its not that great at keeping rice as fresh as it can be but then you can just throw it in the fridge im just use to asian rice cookers where you can pretty much keep the rice in the cooker and itll stay warm the whole time on its own having to turn on the warmer again diminishes the rice making it slimey but overall it does what i need it to do and ill just have to cook rice when i need itmy experience
8310,1,after  minutes the screen turned white and is permanently stuck like that we tried resetting it and nothing works complete waste of money and my daughter is heartbrokenscreen stopped working after  minutes
7114,2,i used this for a photo guestbook it is not my favorite looking photo album or the best quality but it worked for what i needed kinda a flimsy materialworked for what i wanted
8036,1,cant turn the printer onhelp troubleshoot
14120,5,"i had same brand beforethis is bigger than previous onelooks great and have brown rice option great for usand easily to cleannice rice cooker"
9481,5,its a crockpot but for rice works great only thing is push the bottom to cook it knows when the rice is ready once its ready itll switch to warmrice cooker
14738,5,absolutely love it i use it all the time to make the brown rice for our dogs homemade food and to make all kinds of rice of ourselves too convenient nice size easy to clean not difficult to figure out how to use  i just read the bookvery happy
2987,1,i bought this item new but the film package was already opened upon receiving really disappointingitem was already opened as received  disappointing
12309,5,small and makes just enough rice for me and my husband doesnt take up much counter space so i dont mind leaving it outdoesnt take up much counter space
6633,1,couldnt get the moon like others didcouldnt get the moon like others did
8059,1,i really wanted to love this camera but it took such horrible pictures i thought the first one was damaged i exchanged for another with no difference i tried taking pictures in all different settings and  out of  come out bad i mean my childs fujifilm instant pic camera took much better pictures than thistook horrible pictures
6279,2, i was excited to finally get the calibrite passport but once i opened it pretty disappointed unfortunately the color i am sure is spot on but the packaging of this product makes me concerned its just not going to last the joint is so tight that the sides bend when i am opening and closing it and for  i need to be confident it will last more than a couple of sessions i also purchased the spyder checkr photo which is packaged much better therefore ill be keeping the spyder please see video for specificscalibrite passport vs spyder checkr
14,5,i like the fact that i dont have to use the lightning portal because mine wont stay inworks like a charm
6812,1,im not sure if you remember the first camera on a gameboy but this is exactly like that grainy and kinda spooky lookin way better as a lil kids toy camera than to use also i was setting it up and was already at half battery power it doesnt come with an sd card either everything about this thing blowsdude dont do it
7461,1,important update see original review belowi reduced my rating from two stars to one due to the sellers harassmentscam after i posted my original reviewthey contacted me asking to confirm my shipping address so they could send me a replacement i explained my shipping situation and made sure they had a usable address they contacted me again asking me to confirm my address so they could send me a replacement i answered again starting with a clear statement that my address is current just to give the simplest possible answer and then explained my shipping situation and again made sure they had a usable address they contacted me a third time asking me to confirm my address so they could send me a replacementobviously theyre disregarding my replies i believe what they want us to fool me into thinking the yes this message is helpful button will somehow confirm my address when clearly that is not what it does they were given a usable answer the first time so this looks like a scam and at this point is feeling like harassmentdo not buy from this seller regardless of the awful quality of the camera the sellers behavior offering rewards for higher reviews harassing those who give low reviews creates a terrible customer experience sellers like these should be bannedoriginal reviewim a photographer i sell online my work has been shown in a gallery my stock images have been used internationally etc so the first thing i wanted to know was the quality of the images camerawise this is a very cheap unit so i wasnt expecting much i certainly didnt think it would be up to the level of my newest dslr i just hoped it was above the level of a toy camera and that the photos might be worth sharing beyond family and close friendsnope the images arent even close to sharp they look like they came from a cheap old vga  webcam and were then sized up massively in an image editor which never looks good because software cant add that much detail that was missing in the original image i cant see any way that the sensor in this thing is capturing even close to  so to me that just looks like false advertisingive noticed seller or manufacturer feedback to other complaints about image quality suggesting changing the exposure and white balance there is no white balance setting and even if there was it would affect the color not the sharpness of the image also i tried various lighting settings with the exposure at its neutral setting theres no reason to believe that adjusting the exposure setting will magically make the sensor capture more sharplyi bought this as a hopefullydurable camera for an upcoming trip because the camera in my phone is pretty bad not sure ill even waste the minimal luggage space taking this junk its worse than my phones bad camera by a long shot the only thing this camera has over my phone is that i dont care if it gets damaged lost or stoleni also considered using this camera as a dash cam but i have to wonder if a license plate could even be read in an image from itso my money was mostly wasted although if the accessories that ship with it are goprocompatible then this package might have some value perhaps ill find some amusing way to destroy the camera itself to get a little entertainment value from it shall i see how it holds up being run over by a dump truck hmm maybeother firstimpression notes the documentation is ridiculously sparse even the full manual is way too sparse youll have to experiment and resort to online research to answer any questions hint to open the waterproof case lift up the black piece along the edge just above the lens it will then hinge toward the back and the rest will be fairly obvious the screw in the mount that the camera ships in was on so tight i had to use vise grips to get it loose the battery charger leds go from red to a bright blue when the battery is done charging  and the blue doesnt turn off when you pull the battery out of the charger so unless you really like all that extra blue light you wont be leaving the charger conveniently plugged inthis product is not even remotely deserving of a fivestar rating and any such ratings should be looked at with extreme skepticism i gave it an extra star just for the accessories that might have value later with a better camera the camera itself is basically a  camera due to the awful image qualityskip it really get something else
1621,1,i got this to replace my broken nikon coolpix because i can no longer afford to replace the nikon after less than  photos the batteries ran low i replaced them the images have a faded bluish tinge to them i had some trouble figuring out the menu choices i took those  photos and never used it again waste of good money right now its probably at the bottom of the junk draweryou get what you pay for almost
5126,1,the camera lasted very little after the first week nothing could be seen on the screen everything comes out black i would like you to contact me to see how i can recover the image againnothing can be seen
7844,2,seems like it would be a cool product but it doesnt seem to work with my iphone  pro max it wont connect with my gallery so i cant print unless its from instagram or facebook im waiting for an email response to see if i can fix this but i think i will return this by the end of the week if i cant get any helpgreat idea wish it worked
5566,2,i only received two film and my package came with five as you can see aboveonly received two film it was to come five
3653,1,doesnt work only took  good photos the rest came out completely black i cant even get a refund if you want a camera i recommend getting it at a store not amazonbad quality
541,1,this was a waste of money used it once wont plug in or charge plug didnt seem to fit well in the camera once fully charged wasnt able to charge after the one time using this cheap craphorrible
4580,1,this camera was great for  months but then stopped working i tried all troubleshooting tricks and it still doesnt workbroke within  months
6637,1,this camera was a christmas gift to my brother a few weeks ago it started to shut down and take bad pictures it has never been dropped and always in the case when not using tried several different batteries and still the same thing i cant even get in contact with the seller such a headache and would never buy again unless the seller contacts me and makes it righta few weeks ago it started to shut down and take bad pictures it has never been dropped and always 
11071,5,"i love my little red rice cooker my other one died and i didnt want to spend a lot of money was pleasantlysurprised that this one while different made great rice even fluffier than my other one only con is it does spout a bit of water while cookingmakes fast easy rice"
8590,1,my screen like a zebrai used with macbook didnt like
8441,1,i took a pic of our dog inside and and used the camera to take a selfie as tge directions say to do so was not happy with the colors of the print out and the photos print out slowlykidak zinc photo paper
1483,1,the batters only last about  minutes with  aaa and when you take a picture the screen goes fuzzy and freezesdo not order
5471,1,i hate this camera because it is too smart for me i am  years old and have tried to figure out how to use it without success i bought books etc and just cant make it work for me now the simm card keeps telling me to insert again each time i put it in it is very frustrating i waited too long to return it and am very sorry i got this one as an  bd gift from my husband i live on a lake and love to take pictures of the birds and wildlife around methis camera is too smart for me
6536,1,difficult to adjust brightness and color temp failed after less than  months will no longer turn onworked less than  months
4820,1,it worked nicely until out pf the blue it stopped working very disappointingi bought two both broke within  weeks of purchase bery unpressed
595,2,for the price it is ok however the picture quality is terrible i bought this for my  year old neice since she is taking up photgraphyi myself am a photographer and now wish i would have spent more money on something different for a kid just wanting pictures and not caring about quality it is fine however if you want good clear quality photos like she will need for  this camera is not going to cut itwould not purchase again
5299,2,i have not been able to use the camera yet the battery has been charging for about  hours and is still not showing as ready this type of battery is not cheap so im hesitant to buy a new one since the new one ithat came with the camera is not working i have taken it out of the charger switched outlets any suggestionsthanksbattery not charging
6444,2,i ordered this camera knowing it was not a true  from other reviews but for what i am going to use it for i am using it for a target camera for my videos that i make for youtube works great for that no movement so for me it is what the doctor ordered and saved me a lot of money i gave only  stars because as it works for me i know the vast majority it will notnot a bad product it has its place
13099,5,"i researched rice cookers before i bought this one and i am very happy with ityou can follow a lot of rice recipes right off the bag the steamer work great you can keep it on for  hours if you add extra water its lightweight and easy to clean it fits great in my small kitchen its easy to usegreat product  highly recommend"
14292,5,top quality  excellent product cooks perfectly every timeexcellent cooker
6606,1,i am very disappointed this was a christmas gift for my son and i read all the reviews and compatibility with devices my son has an iphone  that operates on the  operating system the description said it would be compatible with the device what it did not say was that the snapbridge app would not work with  for certain camera models one of which is the nikon coolpix  it doesnt mention that anywhere until you read the fine print in the app description on the app store no word in the app description for when we can expect this issue to be fixed so i am returning the camera terrible experiencedont buy this if you have an iphone operating on 
13466,4,we were very excited to get this rice maker zojirushi is a reliable brand there are two main issues  there are only whole cup and  liter increments making  cups of rice or some other fraction is not easy  when we first got the rice maker the first  batches were horrible the rice came out soggy we tried adjusting the amount of water but it kept coming out wet after about  batches the rice cooker seems to have settled in now when we put in  cups of rice and fill the rice cooker with water to the  line it comes out fine by the way thats about  rice scoops of water so a  ratio is about right but thats not what happened the first few tries im glad we kept trying instead of tossing the machine but not a great startmight take some time for the rice cooker to cook correctly
7143,1,the instax photo comes out too bright and is not as how is pictured on my phone the third photo is compare of the canon ivy printer and which has better quality than the instax printer on the other hand it is easy to usenot worth it
11957,5,we had a foreign exchange student from thailand and he recommended this rice cooker i couldnt be happier with this every time it makes perfect rice i will never go back to a cheap rice cooker again the only downside is that it takes about  minutes but i just know that i need to start the rice first when i am making a meal you can also steam veggies at the same timeperfect rice every time
2276,1,the quick start paper that it came with has nothing on downloading the pictures plugging in the cable it doesnt automatically connect to my computer there is no obvious solution on the connected camera i downloaded the manual but what comes up when searching download doesnt tell me anything useful scrolling through the manual guess i will eventually find it but this should be much easiernot userfriendly
2285,1,no rechargeable batteries takes good photos but is very battery consuming and no chargerno rechargeable batteries
3527,2,i will leave a disclaimer that i have not tested the product to the full extent where it may shine over competition by a small margin in video qualitystabilization or other factors but the app is  required to even register the device and its perhaps the worst app ive used in half a decade had to rely on a guy from youtube to even connect the camera go through full reset if you can only register but not connect the camera in the app the response time between hitting record button and any change can be  seconds when i wear gloves i cant use the app at all due to such latency never know if i actually pushed button and the second tap can stop recording even before the ui shows up after  charge the battery hit  before i even recorded a minute of footage just from registeringi had to do it twice there is absolutelt no way to turn off back screenbest option is  min screensaver only the front when your battery life is already total trash this is just an insult to your customers at this price point im not even sure why this product even exists besides its ability to ride a wave of good pr and marketing by goproworse battery life than my old action cam i got for under 
960,2,i received mine on time but it does not come with a  micro card nor does the user manual say so in the package contentsa little disappointed
6326,1,its a disappointment not charging at all 
1478,1,these cameras die after about  shots and the resolution is awful i bought them for my class students and they are now collecting dust but i guess you get what you pay fordrain the batteries
4660,2,i insert an sd card into the slot and plug the reader into my samsung galaxy   nothing happens if i manually navigate to the files section i still dont get anything i tried it in my sons samsung  and it notifies him that the reader has been plugged into the phone but he cant access any pics eitherdoesnt work in android phones
5683,2,this doesnt work with kodak step wireless mobile photo mini printer i purchased as a bundle and i am very disappointed that it doesnt work it was a excellent price and a great value but it doesnt work for my photo printeri placed it in the printer and it stated that it was the incorrect zink photo printer paper i do wish i couldve used it because i purchased another pack that i have to return as welldoesnt work in kodak step wireless mobile photo mini printer
14100,5,i received the cooker a couple of days ago and made white rice and mixed rice both are good my experience tells just adding a little bit more water than instructed will give you softer rice if you cook rice for sushigreat product
7291,2,the camera is not factory refurbished it came wrapped in foil the battery it came with is generic not original gopro battery i updated wifi and firmware and it acted up once i took the battery out it seamed to be finenot factory refurbished
2852,1,pretty easy to set up but quality of pictures not so great you need to have a lot of light in order to get a good picture to many buttons to push to do anything not thrilled at allfits perfect
5336,1,the film is not the best quality  out  films actually printed or came out with picture very disappointed in this product the camera its self is stylish and i love the case for it over good product but the film ruined my experience with this productfilm is garbage
3497,1,i bought this for my kids in dec  the had it for one week when i realized the lid after you remove the back to replace paper wouldnt close so i returned original and received replacement but now replaced camera has same issue there is a design flaw with closing mechanism of the lid its based on these flimsy little prongs or lashes on the lid that once they break or chip thats it it wont close properly now my kid has to keep the lid on w tape still works but really crappy design i suggest going w polaroid brand i wish i didas for the picture itself if its not really bright or outside during the day your photo will be dark  shaky looking despite the weak flash installed again  just go with another brand all togetherbeware design issues do not recommend
9954,5,"this model is the best one for oatmeallet me tell you about my journey at christmas i bought a different model riceoatmeal cooker it was the same aroma brand but smaller and definitely not as good when i cooked oatmeal on the oatmeal setting it would spew oatmeal fluids out the air hole and make a complete mess of the cooker and counter it died less than a month after i bought it i had gotten it from kohls and could not return it i continued my search for the best rice cooker with an oatmeal setting i found it i ordered this one and to be covered i ordered the  year protection plan as well i have to tell you that i am so pleased with this model when i make oatmeal there is never a splatter it cooks it clean and perfect every time i highly recommend this model if you want easy clean hot oatmeal in the morning for breakfast five stars for this onethis is the best one for oatmeal"
6053,1,bought it as a gift and im returning it looks like it came from the dollar storemade china cheep bad
2260,2,although just the few times i used it for a trip out of no when it just stopped working the camera just turns off on its own mid video recording also when i try to turn it one like the lense keeps coming in and out and the screen stays black it doesnt want to work and now the camera is stuck with the lens out and screen black changed the batteries  times and still does the same thing i really liked it to bad it just doesnt work will returncamera stopped working
845,2,bought this as a bundle and the case isnt even compatible with the shape of the camera super disappointed the camera itself takes a decent picture but the button to take the photo is in a awkward spotcamera does not fit properly in the case
4387,2,not worth the money very over priced and here is way the picture quality is below average it just doesnt do my photos justice my photos look much better on my computer or on my phone also it is not user friendly very difficult to upload photos the only time that it uploads photos seamlessly is the first time each day that you try you can only upload a few photos at a time maybe up to  then you need to turn it off and come back in an hour or so and try again i just tried to upload about a hundred photos at once being that i had just logged in for the day no luck i signed out and will try again soon also this unit does not let you know if you are uploading a photo for the second third or fourth time bummer and to make this even worse you cant scroll though the photos that you have uploaded to deleted the duplicates in a reasonable amount of time its so slow to get rid of the dups i deleted all my uploaded albums and started over with a external hard drive that will tell me if the file has already been uploaded also worse of all i had  photos on this unit and it showed the same photos over and over ugh i have at least  hours into organizing and uploading only to have to delete and start over this unit is just bad for this day and agethis product could be so much better
6516,1, this is my second one the first started flashing after a few months this one started flickering after a few weeksthe first one had issues retaining a charge after a few months of very little usei had two and both started flashingflickering after very little use
3475,2,this is fun and great idea but the quality of pictures are trashy im kind of hitting myself for going against my normal option but i guess the price matched the quality of what i was buyingnot really worth it
7512,1,its a complete crapshoot whether or not this camera will even record videos or if the video files will be corrupted and require the memory to be reformatted it cant be depended on at all for use as a bicycle dash cam as you never know if the video files it records will actually be usable or notupdate it gets even better as the camera has a habit of just spontaneously turning itself off in the middle of recording seriously this product is not worth it even if freeupdate again just when i thought it couldnt get any worse i discovered that the fasteners provided for the bracket in the package are rusting they are not corrosion resistant for a product that proudly displays a person on a mountain bike on the package this is pathetically illsuited for that task or any task do not buy thisuseless junk that fails to record half the time
6621,1,i love my nikon but i dont like the fact they have designed the battery door to be very difficult and tight to slide into place i think its what is called planned obsolescence inthat something is designed in such a way as it will make the item unusable after a short time forcing you to replace it much too soon after purchase you choose if you want to buy it because i would bet the battery door will be the reason you have to buy new or send it in for repair even if it is covered by a warrantybad design or planned obsolescence with a bad battery door
17475,5,"perhaps the number one question i get about my rice cooker is why would you spend this much money on a rice cooker quite simply put almost everything about this rice cooker is perfectcould i write a long detailed review of everything this rice cooker does well absolutely but there isnt a need for that this rice cooker is made in japan and every advertised function works well and produces the best rice you have ever eaten i have zero complaints about this rice cooker no hotspots in the cooking pan and very energy efficient from the use of induction plus it plays you a song to let you know your rice is finished cooking the timer function is out of this world  tell it what time you want rice ready and it will be ready at exactly the time you specify made too much rice set the extended keep warm and you can have rice that is still moist tender and separate grains for  days if youre in the market for a rice cooker you cant go wrong with this modelbest appliance ever"
3930,1,almost all accessories it shows were not in the box except the case it would not turn on at all no matter what i did and the real kicker was that i ordered the mini  in yellow and instead got the mini  in whitebut didnt work it was all in all just annoying and frustratingbought it received broken and wrong camera  missing pieces
3621,2,i tried using this camera at my birthday party and at first it worked fine then it stopped working when i got home i tried replacing the batteries and none of the ones i had worked so i ordered another one hoping that maybe i was just doing something wrong no turns out none of the batteries i own work with this camera i do not want to buy other batteries or specialty batteries for thisultimately i could not get it to work ever again after the batteries it came with apparently ran out of juice after a few photos perhaps this is a fluke and complete user error on my part but i just had to return it as i do not want to constantly deal with this battery situationreally wanted to love it
7747,2,firstly i understand its a toy but for  dollars you cant justify having the picture quality of a potato easy to use cool toy but picture quality is tougha very nice toy
338,2,i had a panasonic bridge camera years ago that i never should have sold i was hoping this would make a decent replacement i was very disappointed in the ease of adjistment adjusting exposure etc i ended up giving this to a friend as i was too frustrated with it to put this in perspective i am a advanced amateur with my own studio i shoot film digital  and medium formatnot easily controllable
7889,2,just compare the printed photos with my original ones all the colors are warmer and dull than the pictures and i cant print continuously i need to reconnect the bluetooth for every photo sometimes it takes several tries to connect it sucks have to return itpoor color performance and connection
7122,2,flimsy and cheap which it was but i was expecting it to have some structure feels like a folder youd use for school and i thought it would be like a photo album with sturdy spine at leastdisappointed
12225,5,"i wish that i bought a rice cooker years ago doing my research almost every article i read named zojirushi the best brand you can buy it has lived up to its reputation i have made sushi rice long grained white rice and steamed vegetables and most things have turned out very wellthe one quirk i have found is the keep warm feature you will get your best results if you turn off the rice cooker as soon as your rice or vegetables are done if you leave long grained rice in a warmer mode it tends to dry out if you leave vegetables in the cooker they will slowly overcook and turn to mush when i have removed rice or vegetables as soon as they were finished they were perfect my advice is to avoid leaving things in the cooker for longer than necessarygreat rice cooker with one quirk"
4210,1,only received  film not  product
4987,1,i only received the camera and i paid way too much for it it was cheaper in the store i thought i was getting everything that was in the picture i didnt even get film or batteriesi only received the camera and it showed way more in the picture i paid way too much
1119,1,camera is only good to take pictures in sunny bright environment without using zoompicture quality drastically reduces when you use zoom or light is slightly reducednot worth even offered at  offtoral waste of my moneytotal waste of the money
469,1,i purchased this  years ago and have never really used it  now it is not working at allterrile turns off every second
17346,5,i wanted this made in japan beautiful rice cooker two weeks ago and she was delivered last night  i was very excited but noticed right away when i took the box in from my front door that the box has a hole on the side i was hoping that it was just the box that got damaged but sadly the cooker is damaged too and the damage is right on the control side i had to return her this morning hope the seller reads this and promises to use an extra shipping box next time i really love and want this cooker thank yougreat beautiful rice cooker
650,2,i bought this to enhance my outdoor experience it was completely misrepresented and i cant use it for that furthermore computer support does not come with it for the stills or the videos i cant use my stuff on facebook or any other the zoom falls apart as soon as you bring it up it is about the same level as the camera i bought  years agothe advertising is misleading
17552,5,"i used it for the first time this weekend for hosting  people i made the full  uncooked cups of basmati rice and used the white rice normal setting at the recommended water line it took  minutes the rice texture looked just like a restaurants and presented beautifully for hosting but i dont know if it tasted any better  basmati rice is fragrant and delicious as it istoday i cooked  cups of the planet rice sprouted brown rice and used the gaba brown rice setting i was really nervous on this one because  my family is not crazy about brown rices blandness and texture and  gaba brown rice is so expensive so i didnt want to mess up the gaba setting took  hours to cook i started it after breakfast and it was ready by lunch the rice cooked wonderfully the texture was perfect and my family loved that the rice did not taste anything like brown riceone of the best parts was that there was zero messy water splatter to clean upone of the confounding parts was that the zojurushi measuring cup looks similarly sized to my normal rice cooker cup but the cooked rice quantity appeared less than my normal rice cooker output maybe the zojurushi cup design is deceiving tomorrow i will compare the quantity of rice held between the zojurushi cup and the normal rice cooker cup to gauge the differencecooked basmati and gaba sprouted brown rice"
10018,5,super quick and convenient makes my meal prep easiermust have
6701,1,only one out of every ten pictures actually prints the customer support is non existent the instruction manual has  way of contacting the manufacturer i would not recommend this product at all very disappointingdoesnt work and no customer support
6056,1,it wont charge at all so is a waste of money and useless to buy my son was very disappointed in thisbad
2883,2,i was super excited to get this camera in the mail i brought it on my trip to miami and took so many cute pictures that i was looking forward to post on social media little did i know the sd card does not work when trying to upload pictures onto phone or laptop i have watched videos read almost every review and looked up different ways to try and troubleshoot this it is simply broken or does not work i am extremely dissatisfied as i had high hopes for this camera based on the reviews so upsetvery disappointed
13106,5,i love it makes rice pretty good and easy to use i recommend itworks great
7135,1,the photos are deceiving the product looks extremely flimsy and cheap 
4333,2,this style of bag is a good idea and the altura is decently constructed however the overall design is flawed because of the way the main compartment zips open you could easily drop your expensive camera the compartment should unzip with the compartment facing only up towards you but it opens too far facing up and away from your body this can lead to the camera tumbling out and away from you even with the strap across the flap being secured plus to sling the bag to your front is not as easily done as i would have likedconstruction is decent but the design concept is flawed
7126,1,not worth the money you could literally buy the same thing at the dollar store for way less i thought i was getting something that was a hard cover and its like a cheap school foldercheap
6200,2,pros yes it will keep your camera drycons big thick bulkythere is no way to zoom your lens with this attachedits impossible to use the view finder with this gigantic camera condom on ityou cant really see the live view mode well either because the clear area on the back fogs up and is so far away from the camera body it doesnt sit against itstill searching for the right item i ended up just sitting it on the camera while i walked and set up then id take it off when id shoot however it so big and bulky theres no easy way to carry it or store it when it isnt sitting on the camera id go with a plastic grocery bag over thistoo many drawbacks to be useful
13782,5,this makes the best  soft fluffy and moist rice 
6563,2,after long experience with this camera and a couple of cheaper models of the coolpix i have given up on it i thought my problems with it were due to my lack of expertise in photography i now see that the problem is the camera my photos usually come out grainy and not sharply focused only in ideal outdoor light do i seem to be able to take good photos occasionally a dealer at a camera store in new york city explained to me what the problem is this camera does not have a good processor so it can not adjust focus well especially say on a gray day or where the lighting is poor the zoom feature is great but its of little use in the final analysis because of the focusing problem my iphone  which does not have zoom capability takes photos that are a hundred percent clearer and sharper i have given up on the coolpix i just laid out  for a more expensive sony camera which is said to take great photosnikon does have an  us help line they are only available during business hours monday through fridays they tried to be helpful but the support people did not seem to know that muchonly in ideal outdoor light do i seem to be able to take good photos occasionally
9681,5,it makes great rice and it boils my eggsi love it
4229,1,i was so excited about this and read good reviews my camera took about  pictures before it stopped working mind you each were beyond pixelated and blurry but now if i click to take a photo it says picture saving and wont go away until i shut off the cam the picture never saves if i go to take a video it says device busy cant get the camera to work at all now after having it only for about  work  awful quality
4852,2,purchased for a christmas gift and its already broken and not taking pictureshad it for less than a month
8168,2,the fact that it was annonse with  batteri life is in fact wrong at least  stand bythe wifi connection is slow and can be a bit annoyingmemory storage is quite a joke a person have to take more money the buy a really huge accapcity memory card just so that you dont run out of memory while recording and driving in myoption i think this could have been better manage user friendly stand by its annonse capabilities and more before i would think twice on buying another i think i lose my money by buying this camerawait before buying read more reviews disappointed
12348,5,i cook rice everyday for my chickens theyre spoiled so this was perfect in the amount of rice it cooks the small counter space needed and the quality of the cooking it can also be used as a steameruses very little counter space
7718,1,buyer beware camara arrived with a broken screen and was nonoperational huge disappointment especially after the kids were excited and anticipating its arrivalcamara arrived broken
13959,5,works quietly cooks well i am very happy to purchase its a pity there are no spare pots anywhere to cook several dishes at once and put them in the refrigeratorthis is the best solution for a car for a truck driver
16718,4,the design is pretty and the food is well made price is so sogood
12717,5,we eat lots of rice in my house and i was ehhh about this i used to use a  rice maker from our local publix rice was always good but this makes the rice fluffier and very light we love itgame changer
7407,1,i bought this camera to document my pregnancy in polaroids  ive had to replace the batteries in less than  months the camera is constantly requiring new batteries i dont even need or want a refund i want a camera that worksdefective
7317,1,considering the fact that the case brokey first time diving with it and dropped the camera and a  sd card to the depths this has to be the worst refurb item ive ever purchased and the warrantycompany doesnt do anything for it even though the hinge malfunctionedthis has to be the worst refurb item ive ever purchased
14891,5,i prefer stainless steel over nonstick i searched all the stores and found this one on amazon super liked itawesome product
7389,2,ive had this camera for about a month and a half and ive taken a handful of pictures with it   in natural light and  in dimmer rooms  the natural light pictures are leagues above the dim rooms which is to be expected but i just cant stand the quality of the pictures im not sure if its user error but all of my photos have come out blurryfuzzy though im not sure what i could do to fix this since theres no manual focusing outside of regular mode and selfie mode there was one picture i took in my room with the lights on its the one on the far right in the picture and the flash went off which made the picture come out extremely dark for some reason and was just a waste of film ive experimented with trying to cover the flash since its automatic depending on the lighting and that didnt produce good results at all so youre stuck with the camera deciding when it needs flash unfortunately overall i think the camera itself is adorable and the pictures can be cute when taken in natural light but for the amount of money youre paying i would recommend looking at other camerasi really wanted to like it more than i do
245,1,ive tried stills  items ive tried my cats action and sitting ive tried nothing and carpet literally i just cannot figure it out this is a point and shoot camera how in what way i have a single photo that is as good as my iphone and the rest are pure garbage i have fiddled with every single button after going thru the manual and dont get it and guess what  you dont get to find out all of your pictures turned out like poop until you load them into your computer because they all look just fine in the camera itself extremely disappointed super crabby  dont get it
9036,2,this is a very cute camera buttons are confusing it has puzzles and games the pictures print out on a roll of paper like a receipt the pictures are dark and grainypaper roll
8955,1,i would suggest this product to no onewould not focus and had very low quality photosi paidi sent mine back
7550,1,decent video quality at  and  but  is an outright lie other than making the file size  as large as  there is no difference in video quality this would not be a beal breaker for me as the  creates a pretty nice image clip system is junkwhy it is junk it will not maintain the date and time you have to set it every time you turn it on this makes it impossible to organize and locate files not ure how they screwed this up as it is the most basic task will it record your trip maybe went for a ride yesterday red light was blinking but no recording found or maybe it did and i just couldnt find it without playing every single video on the sd card since it uses a semirandom date and time stampfrustrating piece of junk
1920,1,i received the camera and it worked for the first day i got it and after that it would not turn on a red lights pops up when i switch out the batteries but nothing happens after very dissatisfiedbroken
2837,2,just picture quality is not up to date its okay
10487,4,this one is so convenient for me as i can prepare rice for  meals per day in onetime cooking the only problem is that when it cooks the boiling water will overfly every time i cook  cup of rice the measuring cup that came with the rice cooker overall it works great but would be easier to clean without the overflowed water during the cooking processit works but not perfectly
5943,1,wrong product entirelywrong orodcut
24,5,nice material good quality it charges fast recommended buy for iphone with wireless charge userswill definitely buy again another  pack
3548,2,over heats way too much when it works its nice insta  blows it awaywouldnt buy again
3206,1,not comparable with my canon slrpoor quality
4732,1,this would not take a charge therefore its usable we missed the return window because it was a gift for my daughters birthday i thought it would be a good thing to get her gifs in advance but not this time very frustrated as were left with a broken cameraarrived broken wouldnt charge very frustrating
11121,5,this is compact but cooks alot of rice so easy to usejust fill and push button turns off and keeps warm without any fuss has the steamer on top great feature to do  things at onceso easy
2579,2,i only got the camera i was super disappointed because i didnt get any of the other supplies that it listed and was really looking forward to it had to drive to kohls to returndidnt receive all the products
2850,1,the camera has stopped working within  monthsthe camera has stopped working within  months
1849,1,i was very disappointed with this poor quality of this  camera any smart phone will take the better quality photos so i dont recommend to purchase  not great
3364,1,very poor quality would highly recommend this for a kid or child starting offpore quality
197,1,for what i spent there is no zoom lens i bought a cannon years ago for   that did twice as much as this one and i never had to buy a expensive zoom lenswaist of money
8330,1,stopped working after  days just froze up my daughter was so upsetawful
10463,5,my husband and i are empty nesters and bought the mini dash steamer as a small rice steamer for two we also own a small dash air fryer and love it for many things french fries crispy asian beans crispy brussell sprouts roast potatoes etc in the steamer we made perfect sushi rice in the inauguaral run but i tried a few things the next day from the included recipe book im in love with the dutch baby a kind of yorkshire pudding pancake and made two perfect versions next i tried eric kims steamed korean eggs which he formulated for the microwave works just as well in the mini dash steamer next up is herbed polentathis steamer does way more than make perfect sushi rice
6896,1,continuously records until micro sd full regardless of resets restarts and settings completely worthlessdoesnt work
2831,1,i just got around to trying to use the camera before my daughter goes to camp it keeps saying card error but we followed directions exactly inserting the card its probably too late to return it since we just now got around to trying it funny thing is we just found a video online saying the same thing figures knowing where this came fromdoesnt work
2275,1,this camera take awful quality photos save your money and do not buy this product no matter what you do or how you change the settings it will only take blurry or dark photos i wasted my money dont waste yourssave your money and do not buy this camera
8849,1,i do not typically leave bad reviews but i cannot let other avid photographers make this purchasing mistake that i did this camera is marginal at best its only real feature is the zoom i purchased it for my australianew zealand vacation hoping it would provide me with magical photos of the trip truth be told my camera phone took and takes better and clearer photos all the accessories it came with from the lens cap to the strap to the sd card were all crap so plan on purchasing new ones before you take the camera into the field honestly with so many new cameras and styles in the market this is not a good purchase dont get sucked in by the zoom like i didso underwhelmed
1004,2,the quality of the pictures are a only as good as a cheep android cell phone and there are no filters to even make adjustments to the photos where at least you do have filters and cropping abilities on a cell phoneits about as good as a cheep android cell phone camera
1923,1,half the photos come out completely black or blurrylove the idea and extras but camera takes crap photos
12297,5,i wasnt sure about getting one but after doing my research this brand was on top of the line im puerto rican so i have cooked rice in a metal pot all my life like we normally do in our latin homes this rice cooker is hispanic approved lol i was able to add onions olive oil salt lemon cilantro and my rice turned out amazing glad i made the right choice my first day using it and it was a successrice perfection
3664,2,i ordered this for my greatniece i gave it to her last yeardec   on march   she informed me that it was not working i would like a replacement or a refund please adviseunhappy customer
7737,1,i was hoping to get a few fun pictures that my daughter has taken over the past few months but when i looked at them on a computer they are terrible quality this is purely a play camera do not expect to get any decent pictures off the card for  this is way over priced compared to other cameras you could buypicture quality is terrible
13961,5,i have owned this rice cooker for about  months and i love it it cooks rice perfectly eith the touch of a single button very good build quality equal to the best kitchen appliances we own it is easy to clean and stows neatly i coil the cord up and store it in the cook pot so everything is in one place when i need it i have only cooked rice with it so i cant comment on how it steams vegetables or cooks cakes but rice is what i purchased it for this is a really nice toolcooks perfect rice
6066,1,i love this comes with a waterproof case memory card and strap i also really like the blue for boys and girls there is just too much going on there are too many buttons and screens and effects i get that its cool but with number of screens and buttons it takes away from the purpose of a camera to take pictures more importantly when i went to download picture to my computer the sd card simply disappeared into usb so if i want it to work i have to tear up the usb and buy a card reader this is too much worktoo much going on sd card disappeared in the usb
11210,5,everythingquality
1783,1,im extreamly sad i bougth this fujufilm camera on november   and i ge tit on  of january and i paid  with taxes i bought it as a gift i was really happy when i open it and everything was fine but then twoo weeks later i tried to use it but suddenly the red light was blinking and i had to restart the instax later i had to put another new film and was working to weeks later the same problem and today i got the same problem i dont know whats going on i change the batteries but i dont know what the problem is i used the camera like  times alreadyvery sad
2339,1, weeks after my daughter recieved as a gift it quit working light says that it is charging but wont turn on at allquit working
462,1,camera didnt have abilities that were advertised so it was returned and the seller has claimed not to receive the itemrip off
1617,1,bought this for myself to take out to barsparties thinking id get some cute grainy pictures im really disappointed and would say this camera is probably worth at most  the physical camera feels extremely cheap made of thin plastic the most disappointing part is definitely the flash which is a dim bulb with lower brightness than the lowest setting of the iphone flashlight i tested it at night with lights on taking a picture of something maybe  feet in front of me and the picture was almost completely black im immediately returning and would definitely not recommend getting this if you think youll use it anywhere except bright daylightawful flash  not worth the price
1041,1,i bought this for my teenager who is getting into photography we were very disappointed with this camera the pictures were blurry and the zoom was awful we went ahead and bought a used dslr and are much happier with the pictures and results dont expect high quality pictures with this cameradoes not take good quality photos
2499,1,the flash on this camera is automatic and auto adjust everysinglephotoisoverexposed its a big waste of money as the user cant enjoy the photosproblem flash
1025,1,dont buy user manual is in a different language than english not understanding how to set it up the basics arent there bad purchasedont buy
9360,5,i cant believe i went this long in my life without a rice cooker this rice cooker has easy to follow instructions and even includes a few recipes it took me almost no prep time and just  minutes to make rice and veggies theres a steamer tray on top so you can cook vegetables while your rice is being made this is really a perfect design and such a simple setup the bottom is nonstick so the rice comes off easily and clean up is a breeze this is definitely one of the best tools in my kitchen nowperfect rice every time
9283,5,"it is a good size rice cooker for  people can fit party of  people as welli like the fact that it comes with a steamer which i can put meat on top of rice so that they can be cooked at the same timeand it cooks rice pretty fast as well overall i like it i recommend it to a small family usegood size rice cooker"
4220,2,we wanted to get an extra camera for work photos but the quality of this camera didnt work for us its probably perfect for kids but we needed much higher resolution sorry it didnt work out was very easy to usetoo low quality  probably great for kids
7958,1,why this happen to printingpink colour in direct image 
1970,1,camera felt too cheap no weight my phone charger was heavier i thought it would be too easy to break if slightly bumped so i didnt take time to learn all the features wifi not worth price point for me i returnednot my cup of tea
11094,4,this is a bit smaller than my previous model that i had for many many years i hope this one holds up just as well i think i will look for a  cup due to cooking  cups of rice in this although it works fantastically the boiling water reaches the rim and causes the lid to be encrusted with the starch and is a bit hard to clean my last model had an attached lid with a hinged opening and created less messworks beautifully
7695,2,we have had this camera for just over  months it now will not stay on unless it is plugged in my daughter loved this camera so this is a pretty big let down everything else about the purchase was greatthe battery only lasted  months before not holding a charge
1467,1,didnt matter that we put memory cards in them still didnt save the picture total waste of money bought these for my kids for our family vacation ended up having to stop at walmart and buy different cameras completely during vacationwaste of money avoid
16959,5,very easy to use i love the feature of reserving for cooking because i usually not home while working hourseasy to use and clean
8104,1,i bought this camera in april wanting to have some memories of my pregnancy and every time i used it got worse it is not supposed to be like that my partner and i got tired of trying different photo films because we refused to think it was the camera the films are very expensive as well and i never complain about something or leave comments but this really piss me off other brands are less expensive and better than this one 
3725,1,product wont come on battery is fully chargedthe light doesnt work wanna return
7224,1,no directions providedvery awkward to useawkward
5924,1,very easy to use i love the lcd screen option vs printing immediately the film it uses though is down right terrible pictures are washed out and super grainy id suggest going with anything that uses fuji instax filmmy hopes were crushed
2016,1,i wanted to own a polaroid for the last  years but i couldnt afford a good polaroid i was under the impression that this would take good polaroids but its not my polaroid had water damages and stretch marks in the polaroidnot good
4521,1,the  camera never worked properly right out of the box it would work  minutes then freeze up at that point the only button that would work was the power button restarting the  camera would get it working again but the pattern of failures just repeated i spent  of the time several hours dealing with problems trying to get the camera to work sometimes the camera would only shoot bw pictures then suddenly start taking color pictures again the camera was constantly disconnecting from the  wifi app on smartphone forcing a restart of the camera and  app i could provide a long list of functions that might work sometimes but not work other times but it is fair to say all functionality failed at some point i bought an insta  one rs camera two years ago and never had any issues i have no idea if the problems are just with the unit i bought or if there are  or  of units waiting to be sold that will have the same problem and the company is just waiting for people to buy and then return them if you buy one with similar problems youre not the only person with a seriously flawed  camerathe unit that purchased does not work for more than  minutes before it freezes up
515,1,i am so disappointed this worked for about  minutes then the screen froze and the lens would not go back in it was a huge let down i am not happy about this experienceso disappointedwaste and worst product
3324,1,doesnt focus cant take photos of text or book pages as i tried as a test the result looks like youve used a potato to take the photograph mixed light settings forget it it doesnt work tried all the settings im an experienced user and its total garbageluckily its for my six year daughter as a stocking filler and she has the attention span of a flea so it will end up in the bin before you know itterrible
6736,1,im surprised at the prices brevite charges when there are so many higher quality backpacks at the same price range or less the material feels quite cheap and is already showing signs of wearthe sage color is not quite as pictured in the product picture so i would lean on review photos its slightly more of a deeper forest green while their other color options are a bit datedoverpriced for the quality

3841,1,very disappointing paid to much for such a rink dink camera if i had the time i would send it back  a picture wouldnt help you its very deceiving  nice camera for  not  gave  star because wouldnt let me continue without choosing  worth 
8954,1,i dont like the non zooming lens and the fact you have to buy disks for it it is a very basic camera and probably great for specific needsthis is not a great camera the technology is old and the zoom is lacking
7257,2,between poor focusing poor battery life and just generally dissatisfied with a product that had so much hype behind it you can contact gopro for a replacement  adjustment but really they should pull their heads from where the sun dont shineupdateso a new problem that has creeped up the gopro will stick you micro sd card in write protect mode to overcome this you must right click on the gopro drive and open up as a portable device also it may make it the card unformattable just a heads uphero  works way better
6183,1,the portion meant to cover the lens is huge it is longer than even my largest lens and the velcro doesnt hold it around the lens super well so it slips forward and into the photo this would really only work if you have one of the super telephoto lenses definitely doesnt work on wide angle or shorter lensesway too large
1581,2,flash is not bright  cheap designcheap
13409,5,"i spent time in the  and  as a chef so i was quite adept and skilled at cooking rice but i was intrigued with the concept of a rice cooker and a friend convinced me to take the plungewhy oh why did i not buy one of these soonerfirst it is just me and my wife so i didnt need a big cooker this  cup cooker is perfect for our meals for  it is practically foolproof to use the instructions are simple i bought a rice rinser bowl makes it much easier to properly prerinse the rice as well this was not a must have but a good nicetohavei have used this probably a dozen times and it is idiot proof use the measure note since this is a japanese company a cup is  ml or a little over  oz rinse the rice until it runs clear pour it into the cooking pot add water to the corresponding index line on the pot and turn it on in    minutes it will be donehow it works is that when you cook rice the indicator of doneness is when all the water is either absorbed into the rice or evaporated off and the temperature goes above the boiling point a simple temperature sensor detects when the temperature goes above  and voila its doneit is well built simple to use easy to keep clean and it turns out consistent rice batch to batch to batch a bargainbasic simple efficient"
715,2,we had to return this camera bc it would not save photos was very difficult to use especially with normal or large fingers it is super tiny the view finder is  the size of a stamp there appeared to be something weged innvanesbbbroken upon receipt could not save photos something was named in camera
14866,4,"it arrived broken one of the feet was completely off and the way the connection was made it couldnt be fit back onbecause i can weld things it was a matter of moments to weld the foot back on to make it usable but how many people know how to weldcareless manufacturing i dont know how it even passed inspection as the foot was clearly not attached and they knew it  because the foot was inside the pot someone packing it up had to have put the foot into the pot before bagging it upi wont be needing this rice cooker for long so its ok that its poorly made in my casebut definitely buyer beware herearrived with a foot missing"
3589,1, did not work right out of the box gets stuck with a pink screen touch screen is not responsive does not turn off i am hoping this is just a defective unitdid not work right out the box
1739,1,difficult to use stopped working completely after one daystopped working
1186,2,but it didnt work didnt turn on not sure whyi like the style but
2464,2,no zoom additional lens does nothingget a flip phone itll take better pictures than this
11216,5,works good so far cute  easy to operate  cleaning is a breeze i really like it love the colorvery functional and attractive
14714,5,before this rice cooker i only had a really really old dingy rice cooker with one single button so obviously it was an upgrade i bought it in  and my family still use it everyday with no problems  years later it also cleans super easy even with really sticky rice although there are translations and i do know how to read korean my family dont and they are always confused by the controls but i guess thats whatever also i received  when i first ordered this amazing deal lol i guess i was really lucky to get  rice cookers my extra one is waiting for the day it can be usedmy favorite rice cooker and i even got one free
5321,1,overexposed and washed out pictures in daylight and way too dark when pictures are taken inside the exposure setting on the ring for the lens doesnt change we tried spinning the ring but the light doesnt switch settings several of her friends have the same camera and they work great we just got a dudnever the right exposure cant change setting
14106,5,i love this cooker so easy to use and not big makes perfect rice every timegreat
9292,5,very small ive been looking for an easy way to cook perfect rice measure the rice and water and cover it it cooks by itself and keeps the temperatureand the price is favorablequality goods
16598,5,we have two in our household one black and one white his and hers  we compete so eat a lot of rice perfect 
10444,5,what can i say that other reviewers havent already said this thing makes consistently perfect fluffy rice each and every time its actually quite compact smaller than i thought it was going to be so its easy to store and it can make quite a bit of rice i use it for weekly meal prepping and it does the job i will say the measuring cup provided that the instructions say you just use is not actually a full cup its more like  of a cup which is why the instructions state it must be used if you used an actual measuring cup then the proportions would be slightly off producing what i would assume to be a less satisfactory rice would highly recommend however super glad i decided to just give in and get one of these makes cooking rice insanely easyexcellent little device
15791,5,this is a perfect purchase  especially for new cooks easy to follow instructions and easy operationworks really good
8424,1,there is no option on the app to print stickers i printed in collage format however the pictures did not develop i tried  packs with the same result ver disappointingphoto not fully developed
7448,1,very poor picture quality the pictures this camera takes would be comparable to a  camera horrible grainy pictures dont waste your moneyvery poor quality
395,1,picture quality is about the same as my digital camera i had in  quality
14872,4,the first one was damaged the second one works great just cook rice in itrice cooker
4789,1,this camera is a pos i have now wasted  rolls of film from exposure which probably is almost equal to the price of the camerathis thing worked for a total of  roll before the picture counter stopped working this caused me to ruin  rolls because i couldnt figure out what was going on then we just have to guess when the roll will run out if it works i should have sent it back then but assumed we could live with just waiting until it runs outnow this week when reloadingthe black piece that comes out when adding a new roll is getting jammed in the camera so now  more rolls ruined and i cant get the black piece out now to even get the film cartridge outi have purchased  rolls total through all this and have only gotten to use  this camera was a gift and i am embarrassed to have given iti hate this camera and im sad the pictures that it takes when it actually works are great but ive wasted so much money on replacing damaged film from the camera malfunctioning i think ive spent the price of the camera againi would not recommend this camera its way to cheaply made and im surprised fujifilm put their name on this craponly works part time wasted money on replacing film
1252,1,picture quality was very bad very cheaply made over priced camera cheap plasticlow quality
2619,1,product did not come with all the film the description noteddid not include all product
11062,5,this rice cooker must be an old model because the coupon we received with it expired in  despite that i still gave it a five star rating so far is had worked very wellgreat rice cooker
4770,1,bought this one together with vigim  last june  never used it on an actual shoot just tested it when i got it and it worked fine charged it before my trips but never get to used it after a few months of storing them i tried to use it again and was surprised that it didnt hold any charged tried charging it but will not hold charge anymore so i suspect once the battery is drained it will not hold any charge after that too bad what a waste of moneyi dont recommend itbattery doesnt hold charge
4346,2,this is a decent camera bag can easily hold a long lens and a small lens along with the camera body i use it to hold my canon   and  compliant ive had this bag for about  months now and it is ripping apart fabric is ripping along the top side i have used it for about  trip and it is coming apartdecent camera bag but rips after a few months
4709,1,runs slow and doesnt always read what you put into itdoes work well
7071,2,this arrived brokencame broken
10481,4,it does the job it claims to do makes consistently good rice easily but it is messy any sized batch i make it boils out beyond the lid manageable for a  batch but super messy for a full batch i still love the cooker just be aware that it will require a few paper towelsgreat for small batches
8544,1,how unfortunate to receive a new item that instantly gives me an e error i bought this for a bachelorette party and when trying it out it wouldnt do anything other than flash the e i tried the charging battery all the way trying a new film  and rebooting it and nothing returned it asap waiting for the refund and bought an instax mini  from michaels instead that worked amazing id have to say not worth the moneye error
6585,2,i purchased this camera because it is supposed to transfer images to my iphone as i take them after several frustrating hours trying to make the app work and discussing it with amazon technical support amazon had me contact nikon nikon says the app does not work with this camera it may in the future and they are working on it but not nowi have allready figured out how to make this camera work for the wildlife shots that i want and i will keep the camera but i am not at all happythis does not work with snapbridge and iphone  the information is incorrect
9019,1,seems impossible to connect to my mac if im missng something feel free to let me know the instructions for connecting it on the panasonic site include powering off my mac seems very dumbsoftware is very clunky dated and proprietary
14293,5,"this is the perfect rice cooker in addition to rice it makes perfect congee ive tried it several different ways and its always delicious and steel cut oats we are in the process of getting different whole grains like wheat berries rye and quinoa to try the trick seems to be to get the watergrain ratio right for quinoa i may cook it on the rapid rice settingall i can say is you cant go wrong here easy to clean practically just wipes clean only two parts come off besides the bowl to clean and they are easy and dont get that dirty so its a piece of cakei love this more than my cat"
7742,1,it feels filmsy and cheap navigation is too complicated for young kids shutter button doesnt always work bought another one from amazon for  and that ones way better than this both made in chinapoorly made returned
1513,2,i returned did not read sd card and kept shutting off refund took forever  
16885,5,she like it not complicateddaughter uses it
17311,5,first used to make spaghetti sauce able on manual to cook at precise temp and time for perfect sauce very versatile proofing dough nextthen a beef roast love itprecision cooking
7808,2,i do not recommend purchasing if youre looking for a photo book that is more of a keep sake to store your photos the material is a cheap flimsy plastic that didnt seem like it would hold up over time this is a great product if you just need something to shove photos intocheap plastic
4531,1,i chose the  with the full package of accessories for a first  investment based on the quality of the images i saw in some reviews and the touchscreen several aspects of the camera led to my decision to return it most significantly the camera refused to accept a firmware update and it wont stay connected to my smartphone this is not a first generation system i should not be required to tinker with flash downloads and disconnects it was meant to be a gift for a person who is not a tech genius i will need to get my hands on several other cameras so i can make a better choicei expected a smoother experience
4149,1,pos stopped working after just  months gave it to our grandson for his birthday in march will replace it with a brand name competitors product and never buy anything from this off brand ever again very disappointed stopped working
1465,2,this camera us not what i thought it would be naybe fir a younger persontwo stars
9691,4,the rice is fluffy soft and perfectly cooked right at the time the cooker is done it needs to be unplugged immediately or it will absolutely burn within minutes there is no way to turn off the cooker other than unplugging i love the cooker it is easy to clean and a one pot solution for washing cooking and storing the rice you can wash the rice in the little removable teflon pot and put the little pot in the fridge if you have leftovers be careful not to use metal utensils or anything other than a soft rag for cleaning as the teflon is soft and will definitely leech pfas into your food if you are not very careful also be careful not to get any water on or near the exposed element i keep a towel on my shoulder and thoroughly dry the outside of the teflon pot insert and inside of the machine before using all in all it is lovely for the price but requires quite a bit of care and monitoring while usingcooking function works but not the warmer
5762,2,youre not going to get great quality i would print pictures with not a lot of detail and use it for that its a cute idea but i much prefer the polaroid labcute but not great
7645,2,camera is great but package did not include the  picture film as advertised very upsettinggreat camera but no film
14264,4,its a amazing rice cooker though mine said pretty much new it didnt come with the soup ladle or measuring cup for the rice still a  out of  rice cooker
6069,1,this camera is a piece of junk i bought it for myself as a treat as i am beginning my photography journey and did not want to splurge on an expensive camera i was excited to receive this in the mail with the expectation that when i am ready i will be able to upload the images to my computer  and wow i could not have been more wrong let me start off with the fact that the usb cord provided has a smaller end which fits into the camera itself and a larger end which fits into an apple charging cube so when i go to upload the pictures to my computer i notice how impossible it would be for me to insert one end into my apple macbook air    both of the ports on my mac support the smaller sized cable  which is not uncommon for newer apple products or even those of other devices going beyond this inconvenience as i realized that the macbook charger itself solves this issue when i finally plug the camera in and read the directions provided by the user manual the indicated screen does not pop up on either device initially i assume that something is wrong with the cord as i search through reviews on the product but quickly notice that barely any of them mention it being either easy or hard to upload the images to a device  a feature that was very important to me after a few unsuccessful google searches i decide to give up and let the images sit on my camera until another day but come across the fact that all of the images that i previously had taken are now deleted i got the error message that there were no files available on the sd card when previously i had  images saved my pictures were gone and i sent it back both angry and disappointed do yourself a favor and save your time money and memories because this camera isnt useful in preserving any of themsave your money
3310,1,dont know if its supposed to come with a battery but mine came without one safe to say i am annoyed now i have to waste more money just to buy a dumb batterya bit annoyed
1117,1,the lithium batteries dont fit in the provided charger they fall out the instruction manual suggest that you charge them in the camera body if that happens what selfrespecting manufacturer does that i ask i never got a chance to test the camera and its  claim to fame i promptly returned it for a full refund to be fair amazon is not the culprit its these chinese hoodlums who are flooding the market with cheap electronics hoping that some sucker will buy it i say avoid this seller periodthis is a plasticky piece of junk
8239,1,i liked it until it freezes up on me 
14277,5,"wow just wownot sure why i waited this long to buy a rice cooker just a little background on myself i am  old but have been cooking since i was  i love to try new dishes from any culture most of my dishes tend to involve brown and white ricei finally decided to treat myself post christmas with this rice cooker instructions were clear packaging was beautiful and everything was bagged professionally from opening to cooking it only took me a whole  minute had kid running around in kitchen at the time haha my first batch of white rice was for a pairing with some tilapia with minimal effort i was able to make rice to perfectionits funny how i get excited about tools like this in kitchen but this is truly a time saver and consistent results the design is compact enough to put next to all my other kitchen equipment it has a very awesome handle to carry around if need be you better bet i am taking this to my next friends get togetheronce again i highly recommend this toshiba unit you will not regret it only thing you will regret is not buying it sooner like i did hahaawesome rice cooker time saver"
4921,1,really bad quality i feel they stole my money because since i put it in the pool   meters it filled with water i dont recommend that and i need a answer from the companynot water resistant camera its a fraud is throwing money
7189,1,advertising that it fits a  but doesntstrap doesnt work
17144,5,as someone who would constantly burn rice when cooking on the stove this little pot does not use it for all kinds of rice barley and oatmeal does its job wellgreat little cooker
928,1,opened item to view contents noticed screen was very flimsy opened up screen to power on device noticed that a large cracked was on screen unit powered on and is stuck in a permanent cycle of menu button presses making the item non usableordered bc really needed a camera quickly and was let down unfortunately a common theme with amazon these days unfortunately  product integrity standards on amazoncomitem was broken and non usable upon arrival
5795,2,i purchased this camera on a black friday special in  i love cannon products and have been loyal to cannon for years im by no means a professional but my photos with all other cameras have always satisfied me i was incredibly disappointed by this camera and its ability to take quality clear photos particularly when children are involved or at the  feet distance i thought maybe outdoor photography would be its strong suit but its just mediocre at that my phone camera and my cheaper cannon do better i kept it for a year and gave it an honest effort but after it ruined a few special occasion family photos i couldnt rely on it and i traded it back to amazonhuge disappointment
3210,1,no user manual was included this is the first remote flash that ive purchased so having a manual to explain how to use would be nice until i figure it out cant really say how well it worksno manual
4617,2,ive had the device for  minutes and its already packaged to be returned the device  inserted storage is readily detected if you remove any protective case i use a very think case from spigen and its enough to prevent the adapter from inserting far enough into the usb c port on my galaxy   tab  so it isnt detected uselessi refuse to remove my case subsequently reducing the life of the case every time i need to do a simple backup or access a secure file on an external cardreview other characteristics of the device who cares if requires me to modify my environment to use itcome on ugreen your adapters  cables used to be my immediate go to you know the majority of users in your target market will take care of their mobile devicesthis is the second ugreen adapter to be returned in  daysthe usb a end who uses usb a form factor anymoreuseless with protective cases on devices
2393,2,i have the instamax mini  and figured the  would be an upgrade boy was i wrong every photo i have taken with this camera turns out blurry its not like you can set it on a tripod to use it for the price point i would go with the  will be returning this one sadly very disappointed 
14722,5,technologically advanced sensitivity with a pressure valvemakes the best textured rice and holds warm fresh over time
5135,1,pictures blurry doesnt always focus i was just very disappointed the pictures are not  and neither is the video its honestly irritating to use the flash is more of a flashlight i kept it to serve me as a reminder of a horrible choice i made save your money and buy a better quality camera pleasenot what it seems
6985,1,only took two photos with them and it started showing an error message and didnt work ever since i wouldnt recommend it but it works for some people i guessdoes not work
3538,2,i am unable to answer the questions as to how well the camera records because it did not come with an sd card it does not save anything without an sd card now i have to wait until i can purchase oneno sd card
9521,5,i bought this as a gift because the one i have is go greatbought as gift
5842,2,not new used never said used in descriptionnot new used never said used in description
1711,1,ive tried using this camera a few times and the camera doesnt focus on the subject at all cannot use itcamera doesnt focus
1700,1,play video recieved camera today and i let it charge for two hours as stated on the manual after letting it charged it didnt turn on really disappointing didnt even get to use it or turn on lolits a literal piece of junkjunk
6084,2,this worked for approx  days after i got it and then it stopped working it appears to be a problem with the battery connecting sometimes it will work if you take the batteries out and put them back in sometimes it wont there is also an issue with the lens cover not opening correctly not an impressive refurb did not work
5581,1,i was super excited to get this especially with such a fast shipping guess what the whole box and packaging looks like someone opened and redid the wrapping and it only had one box  with one opened film pack instead of  sheets i am returninglooks like an used camera only came with one film box and a half packaged films
509,2,flash did not work had to return ittwo stars
5770,1,i feel the description of this camera as a point and shoot is not accurate i am  years old and when i bought a point and shoot camera i thought that there would be options on the dial such as sports mode night mode portrait mode etc like the point and shoot powershot i own that i have replaced with this one with this socalled point and shoot camera the only thing that is available on the dial is automatic mode basically the other modes require that you input information such as aperture and it would adjust the rest another mode wants you to put in lens speed it also requires that you put in light settings its apparent that you must know something about photography to use this camera i bought this camera so i could take shots of the moon automatic and zoom do not accomplish this task i have no idea how to adjust an fstop or a lens speed setting the basic manual that comes with this camera suggest the full version online manual so i downloaded it as i started to look through the manual it was too overwhelming and i could not figure out how to get to a place in this manual to get the shots i wanted unfortunately all i achieved was to get was a headache the manual is  pages needless to say i did not download it i shut the manual and put my camera in my camera bag and have not used it much since i have not even registered the camera or registered for the extended warranty i never got as far as putting the neck strap on the camera either i feel like i dont own a good andor reliable camera unfortunately i wasted  on a camera that cant do what my  year old powershot can do moonshots aside plus the  warranty that i bought separately also it is not color true i took pictures of purple flowers and they came out as blue flowers i do not have this problem with my old galaxy  phone camera its really sad because i really wanted a camera that could do more for me without me having to know how to operate a camera like a rebel i cant give this camera a rating larger than  star if i cant even use it if you want a true point and shoot camera i suggest you look elsewhere and be very aware what is automatically done for you by just pointing and shooting i am very unhappy and do not have the money to buy another camera obviously live and learn and accept the fact that i feel i got burned i hope this helps the people who dont know anything about cameras and want a true pointandshoot this is not the camera for you in my opinion sad but truenot a point and shoot
3594,1,the customer service sucks for a  canera it behaves as a  is expected to behave more trouble than useuse your iphone if it already does the job for you
564,2,the picture quality is absolutely awful on this camera think vga cameras of years past i wish id never wasted my money my phone takes better pictures 
5764,2,they were all white no rainbow bordersnot rainbow
6348,1,i had to reset my boys camera constantly since we opened it now we cant even open the camera option only able to access the games complete waste of time and money let alone a very disappointed  year old 
5378,1,camera literally took two pictures before turning every photo blue it only worked in selfie mode for another  pictures and then completely stopped working very disappointed my best friend got me this after i wouldnt shut up for years about wanting one returning and hoping the next one works betterabsolutely horrible
1686,1,this camera takes low quality photos im very disappointed wish i wouldve returned within the timeframe i missed it by one daynow im stuck with it unfortunatelylow quality
1906,1,advertising  films only comes with  tried purchasing  times to see and none came with  horrible still waiting on refund from a month ago from the first order trying to get it rightfalse advertisement
5101,2,no i will not be reviewing camera specs aperture sensor size etc this is purely a toy camera that happens to print on thermal receipt paperas such this camera does what it says it takes pictures and can immediately print them out in black and white on receipt paper or stickers for this purpose the pixel count on this camera is enough but what if you wanted to download the picture because it is actually worth keeping thats when youll discover that even pictures from the cheapest smartphone looks bettershould one expect that the camera would be any good no but you are expected to spend  for this device the pictures really should be useable outside of printing on to receipt paper rightso the problem is with the price charged vs what you get camera technology has gotten much cheaper the raspberry pi camera unit costs  and takes much better pictures than this and a thermal printer is not going to justify the price of this devicewith that said if you can get over this aspect this camera is a neat little toy that kids can have fun with around the house or with friends as i said just dont expect to be able to use the pictures for much else what a shame it would be if the kid takes a very interesting picture but the resulting file is just unusabletakes pixelated pictures but the printing part is fun
6245,2,quality material however it is not easy to keep it in place two pieces of velcro hanging inside it but they are not lined up with one another so you cant really use them for anything i have found that it only works if you keep a lens hood on to help keep it in place  the you tube video it suggests dont show how he placed the camera innow i know why i would shop aroundhowever it is not easy to keep it in place
1127,1,this camera should not be advertised for making videos the sound quality is horrible you can barely hear what you record a friend and i even tried shouting to see if that would help nope you still can barely hear what you recorded i thought using an external microphone would be a nice work around guess what the microphone port doesnt work waste of money if you plan on making videossound is horrible  mic port doesnt work either
9718,4,this should be advertised as a mini cooker  brought this to replace my old one but this is not even close to a normal rice cookersmall for students and single people
8351,1,didnt have the right battery so i cant use it and have to go and spend more money on a batteryawful
14016,4,i used to have a nicer rice maker but dropped it so i figure i try this out since a lot of the review recommended for what i pay i was hoping it would have better features one would be nice to leave it warm for a few days as i dont eat rice as much and nice to know if i skip a day i have rice to come back the next day to eat warmeasy to use but wished it stayed warm longer
2321,1,worked one daycharged battery now wont turn onworked one day
13776,4,this is a good quality rice cooker the inner pot is think and substantial unlike most rice cookers are made of thin aluminum the control is simple and reliable the only reason for a  star instead of  is that the cooking cycle for white rice is  minutes which seems to be  minutes longer than the ones i had before with that said the rice comes out very nice and there is no water boiling over to making a mess recommendeda good rice cooker
4236,1,returning poor picture quality very dark even in daylight the pictures came out horrible and blurrypoor quality
7052,1,i really liked this camera the picture quality was great and i loved all the featuresbut the screen froze after just a few hours of using it so i had to return it i dont sugest buying itfroze the first day
5907,2,a month after the camera was purchased the screen developed a weird blurry spot in the viewing area it was not dropped or mishandledthe viewing screen is damaged
7745,2,just buy a used camera for less money it will be easier for the kiddos to use and will take better pictures absolutely do not recommend this productnot worth the money
673,2,i got this camera for a trip im taking next month it takes great pictures outside when the button responds the button is very stiff and does not always activate pictures inside with any kind of zoom you may as well forget about it see photos this camera is going back im going to get a good sslr if you are always taking pictures outside with good light and no zoom this might be the camera for you but i take a lot of pictures inside and need a better cameranot worth the money
3326,1,opened the battery door to put the battery inthe plastic part flung off of the metal hinge the very first time i opened it never made it to taking a picturebroke before i even used it
9046,2,two of the  packs came opened with the dark slide removed im not sure how many images are missing but with how expensive this film is this is totally not acceptableincomplete package already opened
3209,2,it simply did not work well with my canon camera it also was very small compared to my other flashes i really did not like it at allnot the best flash
3880,1,do not purchase this camera for video repeat do not not buy this camera for video im sure you may have heard of ibis and the wonders it has worked for indiemainstream filmakers a like but it does not work with the  the video will look worse than handheld footage extremely shaky and jittery buyers bewareim sure you may have heard of ibis and the wonders it has worked for indiemainstream filmakers a like but it does not work with
1817,1,i bought this for my daughter for christmas it worked half of the day and then suddenly stopped loading the film and taking pictures it would say it was out of film even though we had just put in a new pack in now it just sits on the table not working and i cant get anyone to help me with product support a waste of  work half the time cant get help with product support
5866,1,can not believe that the disk for camera did not come included with purchase i will return cameracan not believe that the disk for camera did not 
605,1,after using it once the camera broke so cheap and so not worth itcheap
14728,5,this took me some time to learn everyone in my house now uses itlove it
7812,1,this item came broken and cracked the whole front cover was coming offitem came broken
11106,5,i no longer have to use the stove for cooking my rice it cooks fast thorough and is easy to clean doesnt burn your ricelove it
3993,1,only received the camera case and film got totally ripped offmissing most items
7787,1,i was hoping for a lightweight inexpensive camera for my  year old to use on trips this takes the worst photos despite working with the settingsterrible
7871,1,the printer is connected to my iphone  pro via bluetooth says connected to kodak step in the settings but when i try to print something from the app it says no devices found and says that no printer is connected even though it clearly is connected as it says so in the iphone settings so this thing is useless its essentially a  paperweight i bought it a month ago but just now got around to using it for the first time and discovered that the return window closed a week ago so i cant return it even though its completely broken and doesnt work coolapp cant find printer
1146,1,nothing like the description blurry photos dont waste your moneyhorrible quality
4599,1,it only came with the camera and the  pictures nothing else who can i talk to  the camera is great but i paid thinking i was getting more than just a cameradidnt come with everything
6882,1,total trash firstly this camera was obviously used returned and repacked as new there are significant scratches on the front cover as well as lines dust and scratches on the lcd secondly the battery cover is near impossible to open feels lighter than a pack of matches  makes me wonder if there is actually anything inside the camera body the overall build quality is very cheap unrefined and worse than a chinese toyreceived a repackaged refurbished used camera and it is lighter than a kleenex
3529,2,terrible product the camera itself is okay small and compact it mounted okily dokily to my helmet mount for a motorcycle ride yet they still havent figured out how to do noise cancelation for wind the device gets hot quickly and the battery life is low dont try to sell me an enduro battery if your product needs a better battery than the one it comes with then you have a defective productlastly  and the reason i returned the gopro exporting the video files directly to a computer is the biggest pain in the badonkadonk prior iterations had a usb mode that let you upload them easily this one does not i managed to finally connect to the dcim folder via usb but the video files are split up into  minute segments and scattered among thumbnails and other junk files the only way to get an intact video that isnt broken up is to use their stupid phone app which is to say is to pay for the subscription service nevermind that they have made the cell phone the central point of editingexporting videos since they have completely discontinued the desktop app seriously go watch youtube creators who were fans of the first iteration finally say this is the last straw for themgopro is acting like its the only cam on the market but there are other better options now im getting an  once this return processeslow battery life gets hot fast impossible to import videos to a computer easily
14743,4,"ive come from a series of rice cookers that had the most simple method of operationa switch that is pushed to start the cooking cyclethis rice cooker is possibly the most complicated cooker for the price it packs a lot into it from the heavy duty nonstick pan to the micom micro computer fuzzy logic cookingthat said i had to get my reading glasses to read the display the display may be sharp enough but the color and lack of contrast make it difficult to read glutinous was the choice shown on the display i pressed cook and it showed on the display that it was working i couldnt hear anything to indicate that it was workingit took more than  minutes for  cups of rice but thats not unusual they were cooked nicely and there was no scorching or any other problemssince it has the micro computer controlling the cooking many options are available to make brown rice and blends just as easycooks well but display is difficult to read"
3075,2,the strap on the bag snapped on the first day of work basically useless now id only use it in emergencies not sure ill be able to trust the reststrap snapped on first use
6338,1,brilliant camera for kids while it worked inky used it  times since christmas and now it wont switch on or hold charge

8728,1,noreturned it not anywhere close to hd or 
1503,1,very blurry  understandable as it is only  mp but the quality of the screen is very low not worth the low quality
171,2,bought this for my daughter in high school she just started to truly use it i picked this camera because it is the same type as the school uses i knew she would be able to learn more quickly the bells and whistlesshes just now taking the class using it a lot and treats it well all said the camera corrupted the digital disks and she lost all her pictures from a shoot now shes running around trying to find someone who will fix itnot happy lost priceless pictures no i did not buy the insurance i expected it to work and i expected my kid to take good care of it  which she hasbroke after   years  barely used
10542,5,i make rice almost everyday for my lunch this makes the perfect rice every single time so simple to use and wash max it makes is about  cups cooked rice so best for  or  peopleperfect rice every time  set and forget
1913,1,i ordered the package with the camera extra things of film and a case only received the camera which does not work at all and the case no extra film or anything completly ridiculousunusable camera and missing film
16962,5,this beautiful sleek rice cooker has made delicious rice every time ive used it and ive only begun to explore what it can do ive made brown rice basmati rice and medium grainsticky rice so far and all were perfect it cleans up beautifully and looks attractive on the counter the only thing i might have wanted was a carrying handle for the occasions when im clearing the counters off for cleaning but that is a very small quibblethis makes amazing rice every time
6656,1,this camera is a joke for the price do not recommend definitely not  and definitely not  
13774,5,"i recently purchased the  cup version of this product have cooked rice  times so far and each time the rice has come out perfectlyi use jasmine rice and and have done a  cup portion each time cup is not really a cup but a measure that came with the cooker i rinsed the rice before cooking and then put on quick rice menu setting which takes  mineach time the rice came out the same and it was as good or better than the several asian restraints i frequent cant ask for more than thatfirst  times i used plain water  time i used chicken broth and  time i used water and a bullion packet very very good each time best part is even when it kept warm the rice for  min before serving the rice was just as good with no burning on the bottom cup is enough for  and  adult large servings just a little left over when it is just me and my wife i was tempted to buy the bigger version but this can make more then we need even when our kids come overperfect rice"
1848,1,i was looking for a cheaper digital camera as i already have expensive ones i wanted a medium quality camera to take silly pictures on with my friends not worrying so much if it was dropped or mishandled by someone who doesnt know cameras however i had to return this immediately after i picked it up and it was plastic this camera was  after tax a little more expensive than regular point and shoot digital cameras the exposure was terrible leaving the subject fully overexposed even when i dropped the exposure to  lowest it goes the camera was basically useless the pictures were drained of color and it costs way more than its worth this is literally a kids camera and should be priced at about  i went on ebay and found a perfect simple point and shoot with vivid colors for  with quality materials you should do the samepiece of plastic
6894,1,revised camera clear clarity not what i expected the website shows great photos but mine are blurry fuzzy not clear at all like the photos the company shows let me revised my reviews again the camera has poor quality not very clear blurry vision each image is not like the photos your show on amazon website the image i capture at night do show imagines but not what i expected yet as i said all day light imagines are poor quality too bad i didnt save one image to attached to this conversation for all the troubles and headaches extra  compensation be nice appliedpoor quality photos
215,2,hithere is no official canon bag or  memory cardscan these items be sent to me please i have no way to carry my camera with me or take pictures without a bag and memory cards 
1690,1,not worth it  audio is badnot worth it
5974,1,this does not come with sd card or if it does my package did not i called gopro and they wouldnt send me one as they do not support amazon purchases buyer beware as now i ordered sd cards separatelysd card not included in my package
6943,1,camera was broke please send me a new asap this was a birthday giftupset that the camera came to me broke this was a birthday gift
9033,1,picture quality is very poor and im very disappointed with this product 
3588,1,if you dont let go pro  into your i phone account and mate it with google it makes it impossible to set up i dont want go pro hacking my phone its none of their business how obnoxious i will return and go stick with  until they resolve this privacy issuegopro  cannot be used without an i phone set up i dont want go pro in my google account
5250,1,the camera was defective from the first photo i took error press shutter release button again the pictures it managed to take were only  of the actual image and drenched in a blue hue as it was under warranty i sent it to nikon to have it repaired nearly a month later i got it back in supposedly factory condition though if nikons standards of factory condition are the state of this camera when purchased i suppose that was true barely in time for the trip to nyc which was the pretty much the sole reason i bought the damn thing in the first place two days into the trip i started receiving the same error message all the pictures i took in nyc are too dark to be memorable thankfully amazon has been gracious enough to help me out beyond their return policy and i will now buy through them a canon caveat emptor nikon be damned and amazon praisedbarely in time for the trip to nyc which was the pretty much the sole reason i bought the damn thing 
16595,5,i really like this one we bought  aroma rice cooker when we first relocated to the us then it broke in less than a year im not too picky with rice even though im korean and my mom cooked rice using  cuckoo my entire life and i can tell rice tastes so much better with this one compared to  american rice cooker your rice will taste  times better and you can just tell this is wellmade highly recommendedkorean approves of it
3873,1,rubbish possibly possessed a real headache to usedifficult to use changes modes without warning
7065,1, ive been really trying to find out whats the issue but i wasted so much money on the paper and everything and i just dont get it its frozen and ive tried to find ways to unfreeze it but no this honestly was my favorite camera if feels like a waste of money nowfrozen
5552,2,the battery wouldnt stay charged i charged it over night and it showed completely charged i might of been able to take  pictures and then it wouldnt take anymore i would turn it off and would be able to take a couple more not sure if its a bad battery but the camera is very cheap made nothing like my last onebought for a cruise disappointed
1667,1,bought this for making photos on a once and a lifetime trip to grand tetons np and yellowstone npthis is a piece of junk photos look like a poor reproduction of a painting the camera would not connect to wifi as advertised tried all different settings to try to get a decent photo with none turning out good enough to share or keep for myself either product is from china and is the worse product i have ever had that was made in china originally when i tried to return the amazon robo assist said the product was beyond the  day return deadline but i was on the trip for almost a month and didnt realize the quality of the photos i took until i returned home and viewed them on a tv the live agent at amazon was kind enough to understand my issues and did refund the price for me lesson learned if you want good photos dont trust reviews for a cheap camera made in chinadont waste your time or money this camera is a piece of junk
2391,1,this camera is a cool design it looks vintage my biggest problem is the lens cover when you press the button to power on the lens pops out but the cover is still on it does open up when you slide it to the selfie mode it will also turn on if you slowly move it between the on mode and selfie mode its kind of annoyinglens cover doesnt open
596,2,i thought this would be decent but its bad its giving cheap camera in a  way not  waycheap
6586,2,i have the amazon rechargeable batteries which i intended to use in this batteryoperated camera it shuts down after taking one picture and if you leave the batteries in the camera after you turn it off it will still drain the batteries this camera is a huge waste of money and batteries what is the point of having a camera that takes decent pictures if you cant rely on it to stay on save your money by buying a more expensive camera because with this one youre stuck buying new batteries every time you want to use itdisappointing
8403,1,i read the color comes from the paper which is why no color ink is needed well the colors dont change much i had to brighten the image and it still came out dark and dull like the original too bad its a great idea too with the printer and extra paper the price was over  it had great reviews too which was why i bought it very disappointed
3489,1,the back comes all the way off to change the film and is difficult to put back on mine came defective and the back wouldnt hold together the next model up is  but it shows you what the picture will look like before you print so its worth it since the film is expensive this model you dont get to preview the picture it just prints even if it is a bad picturepoor design
8751,2,the quality of the photos is very poor and the cost of the film is outrageous additionally the size of the photos makes it hard to see if you have several people in a group its a novel idea but just not very practicaljust not pleased with this purchase
1606,1,got the camera for a  year old and the camera worked for  day before stopping just didnt turn on it charged but the screen never went back onworked for  day
6994,1,ive had this camera for more than a year now and am disappointed i am a professional photographer and before purchasing had accepted that this camera would be purely used for fun i wanted to snap random shots at home of my son and pets unfortunately focus is terribly unreliable even when using the focal length options correctly the closeup filter does not work for selfies as advertised and pretty much every photo is out of focus the subject is blurry while items in the background are nice and sharp perhaps i got a lemon this has been a waste of money camera for more than a year now and am disappointed i am a professional photographer and before purchasing 
1846,2,received this camera on  will be returning on  all of the positive reviews that convinced me to purchase were not accurate at all this camera was purchased to take photos of completed projects before they shipped out typically  photos of a given project the quality of the photos were very grainy and just was not clear not what you would expect from a  camera it was also difficult to snap photos of closeup items that had textstickers with part numbers i took this camera outside to see if i could get any better photos i was not impressed my old very old galaxy note  phone takes better photos than this camera i have two slr cameras and i am very familiar with setting a camera up however this camera in auto mode just does not perform to my expectations before using this camera i fully charged the battery after taking  videos approx  seconds each and probably taking  photos the battery turned red again this camera just does not perform to my expectations and i dont think my expectations are over the top i just want clear photosdidnt meet my expectations poor quality
11068,5,super simple to use how i always screwed up rice i have no idea what i did wrong now i just put the recommended amounts in turn the switch on and when its done it goes to warm mode machine washable partsperfect rice
5863,1,this is not wifi enabled cannon says it is apples fault apple says it is cannons fault neither would help cannon offered to help if i would pay them an additional  does not work
3509,1,tried contacting the seller telling them that my camera doesnt work they never responded or gave me my money back when i received my camera it said i would be getting a  gift for purchasing if i contact the seller i did and of course no responsesuper affordable
8287,2,its disappointing when you open a brand new item and the charging cable doesnt fit properly luckily we have a few of these charging cables around the housecamera is working but the charging cable doesnt
855,2,not sure if its just my camera but sometimes have to turn on and off to get photo to work and some photos come out blank with no picture maybe i got a bad batchhave to turn it on and off to work sometimes and sometimes photos come out blank
7984,1,hellosorry for messaging you so late but i was facing an issue with the camerasince i got it it has been acting up when i changed the cartridge for images it would say that there is no paper and waste a lot of my film which is very expensive yesterday the cartridge ended and it just shut down and wouldnt charge or start at all somehow it started working today but it keeps saying no paper in wasted alot of paper coincidentally checked the print history and it has these random images which means it was used before because it feels like a defected piecethese were taken back in march 
17601,5,i saw some mixed reviews of this rice cooker but i really enjoy everything about it the rice tastes like the japanese restaurants nice and fluffy thats the reason why i go it i love itttgreat product
1175,1,everythingnot good
6318,2,camera stopped working after  day as it was a gift and i bought it early by the time i realised it wasnt working it was too late to return 
11060,5,ive had this rice cooker for about  years now and love it you can make just about anything you want in it my one and only issue with it is that it only has  small legs on the bottom to stand on instead of  which makes it somewhat unstable this hadnt been much of an issue since i was careful about it until today i was holding the handle and using the utensil that came with it to break up some frozen chicken i put into some broth and it tipped towards me and poured hot broth down the front of my shirt thankfully the frozen chicken cooled it down some and no real injury occurred but it could have been bad i do recommend this product but make sure youre being careful so you dont make the same mistake i made honestly only  legs instead of  seems quite silly for something youre going to be cooking inlove it but be careful
904,1,i needed a camera for a one time event and was loathe to drop a bunch of money on one i figured how bad could this one bereviews were goodthe answer is incredibly bad all videos that i took over  minutes and  seconds were inexplicably cut off the camera pretended to keep recording the files claimed to be the length i was recording that is the camera didnt just stop after  minutes and  seconds  it appeared to keep recording but actually wasnt i am left with  minute videos that are  minutes and  seconds of video and then three minutes of nothingdo you really want to roll the dice on a product like this the absolute essential for a camera is that it records video when you want it to this one did not but pretended to utter disasterbuyer beware  you are rolling the dice on disaster
9270,4,it works simple in design and function if you plan on feeding more than  its too smallits a nice small rice cooker for not much cash
6319,1,bought for  year old for christmas  and daughter initially absolutely loved and kept her entertained for hours lots of filters and printing paper is cheap in comparison to traditional polaroid so its not super expensive when children print hundreds of blurry pictures however after just  weeks battery time reduced to just  hour before needing  days to charge before turning on and after just  months camera wouldnt turn on at all without being plugged into charger and since the printing function doesnt work when plugged in its now essentially just a colourful brick massive shame 
6932,2,this camera takes exceptional photos best thing since a polaroid at a much more afforadable price thats the only reason i give it more than  starthe downsides are that its way too bulky with a very cheap body i have gone through  of these now because they stop working for one reason or another after some time im leaning towards the lomo for my next purchase simply because the body is stronger i much preferred the  model even though it was also made of plastic and didnt look as cool with no chrome accentsthe images come out cool blue and theres no way to adjust that no warm tonesthe batteries tent to come loose quite often toooverall its a terrible camera that takes pretty good photos until it breaksi really hope fuji makes a new model soon because i use these for work and havent been able to latelybest thing since a polaroid at a much more afforadable 
4234,1,this camera came with the most terrible set of instructions ive ever seen i bought it from my wife who in her advanced age just simply cannot operate a camera that doesnt have adequate instructionsunusable camera because the instructions are terrible
5217,1,camera came used and scratched over  photos of some other family and weird photos in the albumscame used
8253,2,this camera was great for my  and  year old until it wasnt they havent even had it a week and now it wont save pictures will freeze after a picture is taken and the photo will stay on until you turn it off and on again and will randomly say the sd card is not in it when it clearly is they like the games but other then that it was a waste of  i give it  stars because of the games and when it did work the pictures were decentwaste
7652,1,in the picture and the advertisement it claims that there was film included in the purchase but the film was not in the packaging and was not already inside of the camera very annoyingno film included
6776,1,i would of liked this camera but the port would not charge and it came with a little pink port that didnt look like it was even part to it also it was missing the camera bagbummer wont charge 
4171,1,wont turn on after  monthseven when its fully chargedbroke with  months of use
1980,2,youd think with technology available these days they would print out hd photos or at lease a better focus to correct lighting every photo is a mystery and most are a let down blurry bad contrast and overall do not recommendthey dont make them like they used to
6095,1,this camera worked for about  months until recently after wanting to use the orange light just blinks and wont let me take a picture the camera has not been used in a couple days and has been left of my shelf and now does not want to work what can i do broke within a month
9486,5,this makes perfect rice everytime weve used an instant pot to make rice and i prefer this rice cooker it makes it just as quick and its so easy to useperfect rice in minutes
1735,1,i own a professional camera and know my way around settings this camera doesnt own up to its  reputation in any way i knew when i picked it up the weight was a dead giveaway to its performance the sound quality was garbled and the shutter speed wasnt fast enough even when the subject was standing still i sent the camera back will save my money for a better cameraworst camera ive ever owned
9083,1,wish i could give this zero stars unfortunately i didnt open this until after the return window closed and realized that the film expired on january  it was delivered to me on march  all the photos were taken outside during the day with plenty of natural light but this is how they turned outexpired film
3360,2,sent back because no instructions or flash drivetwo stars
6899,1,this wouldnt take clear pictures it appeared pixelated and loud battery runs down rapidlyjunk
11058,4,this is the second rice cooker that ive bought over the years and i can say so far the rice doesnt stick i do make sure i rinse the rice before placing it in the pot happy so far with this purchase and the price was great toodoesnt stick
5318,1,you may not get what you paid too good to be true
616,2,this product is not what it was supposed to benot what i expected
400,1,the quality of the camera is pretty nice and really pretty  but its raggedy asf the camera wouldnt even turn on without being plugged in  and even then it would black out  seconds later  i do not recommend this camera at allhorrible dysfunctional camera
476,1,i was tired of special lithium batteries dying without warning and wanted a camera that i could put aa batteries into the cannon  i had worked fine and lasted a long time on just two aas i wish they still made itbut this camera is a pig it went through a new set of  aas in less than twenty shots ive got high quality nmh in it now and the battery meter is already showing a third down after less than ten shots i hope i can still send it backupdate i sent it back after getting a return authorization over a week since i dropped it off at a ups store and got a receipt no refund yet not even the release of my amazon points so im not buying anything more from amazon until i get my moneybattery usage is ridiculous
3980,1,this is a scam the camera stopped working after the first  film packs were used and the seller says oh well you missed the returnrefund by less then a week do not buyscam do not buy
4267,2,the quality of the product was good my issue was that the support strap which allows being used as a backpack and not just a sling bag was too short for even a mediumsized adultwas returned for a refundmeh
8319,1,tiny tiny toy poor quality difficult to returnpoor quality
5689,2,sized perfectly for our printer easy to assemble yet the photos came out a bit darker plus a little blurryphotos are dark
9701,4,this cooker is great ive had it over a year and have made rice soups and stews it had a lot of functionality however i think the vent on top is poorly designed whenever i cook as it boils some of the bubbles come out of the top and make a mess on top of the lid not super hard to clean up but definitely annoyinggreat but one flaw
4776,1,so littleit was so little
8999,2,i really wanted to like this camera but sadly it just isnt vey good when im out shooting pictures i find myself reaching for my  phone because i know i will get a sharper image i suppose i shouldnt expect much for  dollars but this this camera delivers very little performancethe wifi is hard to set up and rarely works i have to buy a micro hdmi cable in order to transfer pictures to my tv or take my sd card out and transfer to my pc and then transfer from my pc to my tablet big pain if this were  i might be impressed i know panasonic can do betterthe picture quality is unimpressive in most ways im quite sincere when i say that for most shots my phone is better the auto focus is faster the scene modes are better and the camera functions are smoother and much less sluggish even the video is so so i am happier with the bag i bought for the camera as i sit here i am looking at my old canon power shot  i bought in  and wondering how in the world this camera dramatically out performs a dslr from  smh boo panasonicmeh
2560,1,do not buy this camera for  i was definitely expecting a quality camera for a child this is trash it worked for less than  hours and would no longer print my daughter was looking forward to receiving this camera for months and to have it stop working almost immediately was devastating for her there is no troubleshooting available either ill be returning ours for a refund and spending my money elsewherejunk
8863,1,there is nothing to like about this camera confusing menus and instruction pamphlet heavy poor focus and best of all after three months of trying to learn how to use this camera it breaksthe lens wont move and the error message lens obstruction restart camera keeps showing i am going to throw this in the trash this is the camera to buy if you want to hate photographyawful camera
2846,1,i got this as a christmas present for my daughter there is a weird delay in taking photos and everything comes out blurred with even a tiny bit of movement even still life looks awful would return if she hadnt ripped the boxworst digital pictures ive ever seen
7471,1,this review was originally  stars but im changing it to  star because they sent me emails trying to convince me to delete my negative review in exchange for  on paypal i checked and yes it was a real employee it was a long rabbit hole to go through they started by talking about my review and offering a refund and after me telling them i got my refund through amazon already and saying no to them two times they blatantly and unambiguously said they would send me  on paypal if i deleted my review this is really scummy and directly violates amazons official sellers code of conduct in multiple ways for contacting me through my personal email instead of amazon buyerseller messaging and for trying to influence review scores look up the list of rules if youre curious really makes me wonder how many other reviews on akaso products are legit or how many others have been deleted already im in the process of reporting this seller to amazon for their violation who knows whether theyll actually do something about it lol for now hopefully this review can be seen by at least one person so they can know what kind of business this is and that this camera wasnt very goodoriginal review the extra peripherals for attaching this thing or propping it up are all nice i didnt test the waterproof case and i like that its really small and lightweight but even though the image and video goes up to  resolution its way too fuzzy and looks somehow even worse than my cheap phone camera the price isnt bad but id rather spend more money if it means having better quality than this thingedit akaso saw my negative review and tried to bribe me into deleting it through direct email
5851,1,dont waste your money on this camera im on my second replacement in less than  year for no apparent reason the lens stops retracting no wonder canon wont be making this model anymoregarbage lens problems
5781,1,i have no idea if this is an out of date product but it is not supported by canon at all the manual has out of date info that is of no help the website barely supports the product the simplest of functions requires two three four work arounds case in point i went to drop my pics to my mac i plugged my usb cord with the micro usb on the other end and looked for the input plug on the camera no outlet no way that i can see to export pics other than via wifi or removing the sd card oki guess i just havent reached the requisite level of sophistication for an out of date product so ill educate myself and use the wifi pull up a video on by canon to do this no video for this camera so work around  first thing i have to do is download an ap for the mac second ap ive had to download need to enter the serial code for the camera to do that why serial code is not printed anywhere on camera go to canon website to find out where serial code is this model and this type of camera is not on website giving up and just pulling the sd card garbage product garbage support garbage companygarbage product garbage support garbage company
2542,2,the camera was great for one month my daughter loved it then it started making a scratchy sound when printing and the pictures come out with lines through themstopped working two days after return window
3215,1,i was very excited to get but i was even more to let down the flash works fine but the wireless trigger will not sync to my canon  it says it not compatible the customer service and the troubles shooting help is a negative  stars since i cant any help on troubleshooting i will be sending it back a look for a product that has customers supportthe wireless trigger dose not sync to the camera
8082,1,doesnt come with film get the kodak mini retro one instead same price better and comes with filmno film
8997,2,very beautiful camera but with one huge flaw if you are gonna be doing video with this camera you are gonna be sorely dissapointed which was the reason why i returned it this camera has extreamly slow continuous autofocus in video mode both in  and hd the reason being is because this camera and infact all panasonic lumix cameras use contrast autofocus detection technology while sony and canon cameras use phase detection autofocus technology clearly a much superior technology look around on tne internet and look at what people have to say about continuous autofocus on panasonic cameras and youll quickly see the lumix line of cameras are just not up to the task of doing video if you plan on only using the cameras to take only pictures than yes panasonic cameras will work fine i clearly did not know enough about panasonic cameras when i bought the  i trusted that the video with these cameras would be decent enough after all they are advertising them as video  capable what use is  video if the image is blury because it refuses to autofocus i tried all kinds of settings to make continuous autofocus work for me but i felt that i had already spent allot of money  for something that felt flawed to me i didnt want to get stuck with something that didnt work well how can a company make such a beautiful camera add  video and not make continuous autofocus reliable people on the internet suggested that professionals use manual focus but that is absolutely unacceptable to have to resort to manual focus in this day and age by the way this camera comes with the kit lens the kit lens works fine the kit lens autofocuses fine but the camera came bundled with the  lens and i had purchased a   lumix lens both these lenses make the camera completely unusable for video the autofocus on this camera will hunt never focus or slow autofocus with these two lenses i panasonic had a winner but they ruined it with the contract autofocus technology here is an example of what the problem is with the continuous autofocus in video mode say you are recording a video of your kids your kid is moving around in the frame and getting closer or furthur away from the camera you will notice that that camera will not focus while your kid is moving it will focus only when he stops moving and when your kid eventually stops moving the camera focuses but at an extreamly slow speed this was a disappointment for mebad autofocus technology in video mode
4696,1,it comes out so much from your laptop that you have to always watch out when walking not a good design easy to break i dont recommendvery bad design
14739,5,i use to think that all rice cookers were the same and as i was reading reviews from different sites both professional and consumer level they all kept stating the improved taste texture and quality of the finished product i was still skeptical cause its just rice and water what could possibly be done differently the first batch of rice i made was some brown rice for my dog my entire family and me hate the taste of brown rice buuuut after the rice was cooked we all tried it and ended up having to make a second batch for the dog it was that good we are now a brown rice family definitely worth every penny and yes there is a huge deference in rice cookerssurprisingly great
9290,5,i really enjoy using thisits very easy to operate and when im doneits very easy to cleani would definitely recommend itlove it
11227,2,i just received this rice cooker and very disappointed because of its incorrect capacity the description says  cups but the inner pot is only  cups tiny and cute if you need it for  person i decided to keep this rice cooker because only  people leave in my house unfortunately with the first few uses the coating chipped and it is also hard to see the mark of measurements for water in my old rice cooker i could able to remove the inner lid that part where sediment accumulates but in this rice cooker there is no such option and therefore condensation will always be inside the unitwrong description
10560,5,i love this little rice cooker i use it for cooking shortgrain rice and making small batches of fresh chicken soup it is perfect for one or two people and cleans with no effort its a great buygreat little rice cooker
9203,1,i didnt get to take a single picturedidnt work
3849,2,so glad i bought this one on amazon so i could return it the next day their was really no instructions at all for this camera felt very cheap for the pricethe camera was very warmhot while chargingthat did not seem right happy i returned itwasnt happy
3791,1,i ordered a green one and a blue one which cost more of course for my  granddaughters but the order sent  green ones which is hugely disappointing i wanted each girl to have different colors for obvious reasons disappointing they work fine comes with everything you need but these are christmas gifts so it would have been nice to get what i orderedwrong color
12223,5,"this rice cooker makes the fluffiest sweetest rice so far ive made jasmine rice rice porridge and sushi rice in here after a few cycles for the ai to learn the rice comes out perfect every single timeits easy to clean and care for the keep warm and extended keep warm features are an allday meal lifesaver its a little hefty so im grateful for the handle also i was a little disappointed that the holder for the rice paddle is just a little clipon piece of clear plasticseriously though its sad how much i love this spaceship rice cookernever thought i could love an appliance like this"
6827,1,this is a piece of junk camera we only bought it for my daughter to take to summer camp since she cant have her phone there she went through batteries replacing them twice a day and the picture quality is terriblepass
8911,1,camera came with a bad battery bought it as a gift  days prior to a birthday didnt find out that the battery was bad until the return period had passed and the gift was delivered evidently the camera was defective because we bought a new battery and the battery flap would not close upon going back to review the details of my purchase i discovered in small print that the camera was used my damn money has gone down the drain because i took it to a camera shop and they couldnt do anything with it i am so fing angrygot ripped off
2844,1,this is a followup review now that weve had the camera for awhile it is terrible it is very hard to push the shutter button so that makes it hard to get a clear picture the only thing i like about the camera is it prints the date on the picture   but the picture is blurry so it doesnt matter dont waste your money   buy something that worksterrible camera
710,1,the cameras display has vertical lines running through the right third of the screen and horizontal lines running in a narrow band about a quarter inch wide near the bottom of the screen anything that falls into the occluding lines portion of the display are not recognizable however picture files when viewed on another device do display the complete picture its only the cameras display screen that is defectivei got this camera as a gift for my wife a month before she opened it now its past the returnby date of april  display
1061,1,this camera never worked no instructionsdid not work
3578,1,i purchase this camara for making art videos and its not good for low light even with the flash on i had recorded videos and when i tried to play them on my phone the screen its just black same thing on my computer i found out that i needed to download a codec which made the video play but its was laggy and it skipsso yea not good had to go with the canon  markiivideos wont play on computer or phone unless you have a codec and even with that the video is laggy
5003,1,we purchased this for my mother to give my  year old for christmas unfortunately due to covid my daughter didnt actually receive it until midfebruaryshe loved itwe got it decorated and put in her case which she carried around everywhere she had her photo album filled with pictures within daysbeing that shes  however we were very cautious with how and when she used it film is also very expensive so we really limited her useand then it stopped working i would say she maybe used it  times before thatmy husband tried several tricks to get it working again and nothingand yes we have tried all of themthe lights flash on the front but it will not take pictures we still have several rolls of film left and only purchased  total rolls if that tells you anythingthis was very expensive gift we were all super cautious with it and used it sparinglymy daughter is devastated but the last thing i want to do is buy another one of these thingsi cant believe this is still being soldwhat a bummerterrible
4718,1,the battery does not last and after  to  uses now the camera will only work when it is actively plugged in if i unplug it it immediately shuts off as it does not hold a chargeit was a gift for my daughter that i had purchased in advance so it is already outside of the  day return window absolute wastedead battery
16590,4,great so far have only tried white rice function when i choose sticky for white rice it doesnt really come out it stickymore hard than anything  excited to the other functionsawesome so far
3661,1,i only received  film rolls i paid for the pack that came with  rolls of filmgot ripped off
7026,2,i was very disappointed with this kit the lens pen leaves debris all over the lens cannot use that part at all the sensor swabs felt like they may actually scratch the sensor not sure if my kit was a dud or not the blower works great thonot thrilled
6562,1,ordered this camera for my granddaughter however after i finally bought the batteries the battery compartment is totally tarnished and this is a  camera shame on amazon wish i could give it negative stars my granddaughter was very disappointedcorrosion in battery compartment
6752,1,this receipt paper is very cheap compared to the paper that comes with the inkpot camera it does a horrible print job compared to the paper that came with the cameracheap
16591,5,i really love this cooker good size for me also price is goodlove it
4605,1,had to return because the photos would not dispense out after i clicked the camera to take a photobroken camera because photos wouldnt dispense out
4594,1,the color is different than the one i requested the package is missing everything it only came with small album and  boxes of paper  no stickers no filters no magnets no hangers i provide a second chance to correct my package 
6524,1,i did not like that the battery doesnt last not even an hour even if i fully charge it very disappointed with this led video lightnot worth the money
5213,1,very disappointed lists as taking  pictures and recording in  it only takes up to  photos and records up to  feels very cheap holding it you cannot hear playback after taking a video with the volume up the pictures are not clear video is not clear very miss leading information would not recommend buyinginaccurate discription
5942,1,very bleary prints very dissatisfied went backvery bleary prints
3856,2,cant reviews the photos you take on the camera have to down load an app to your phonejust would not recommendwasnt my favorite
2369,2,i bought this because reviews said it was exactly like the instax mini og ones i can confirm it is notttttt the pictures are blurry and you cannot capture like you were able on the older version i will be returning and rebuying the same one i had last timenot the same as the mini
1457,1,there seemed to be odd colors and performed poorly in low lightphotos were not good quality
14727,4,cooks good rice im not used to how long it takes but i dont think i can dock it for thatgood rice cooker
3611,2,finally bought my  go pro  and a total disappointment the go pro  does so many things its amazing  the challenge is that it is very hard to operate and has some challenges like battery overheating and blows up the memory on your iphone which is virtually required to operate i can only assume that once upon a time this was a simple device to own and operate and now its bloated with features and frustrating to a fairly experienced amateur photog the quik app does not work on my  year old dell laptop and the subscription service has no useful value unless you want to keep everything on your iphone save your money  or invest in the latest iphone and gear to protect it when out in the wild  youll be glad you diddoes everything you can imagine  yet nothing very well
17342,5,"i have to say im impressedi purchased this product for my better half who is from chinathe first time we used this a few days ago the first thing she said was she could never hope to make rice as good as this machine does it it was a perfect bullseye from the very first useim not particularly a big rice eater but you can also make other things with this like oatmeal porridge etc zojirushi has many recipes on their site to assist with a good varietythe first thing i noticed with this rice cooker is the quality and i would never expect anything less from products truly made in japan sure they cost more but theyre well worth it like cutlery buy german or japanese theyre the bestits also working on induction heating not a hot coil at the bottom of the unit so it cooks very evenly and you dont have that scorched bottom of the bowlits very nicely built and looks to be able to stand the test of time its intuitive and easy to use the inner bowl for cooking the rice is also fascinating its fairly heavy duty and well madeadvice read the instruction manual its short but very informativethe trick to making the rice is the washing of the rice watch the zojirushi youtube video online regarding the proper handling of the rice essentially you want to put the proper amount of dry rice in the bowl per the measuring cup they give you use a high quality rice from an asian marketfill with cold water about an inch above the rice swirl it then draindo that againdo that againthen after you drain it form a claw with your hand and agitate the rice  revolutionsfill with water and swirl and rinseclaw it again rinseclaw it again rinsewhen the water is clear and no more milk is present drain it the final time important  you want to complete all those steps in less than  minutesthen fill it to the line in the bowl per how many cups of rice you usedset it to the type of rice on the menu very easy close it and hit startvoila in about  minutes you have absolutely perfect rice i mean its perfecti also tried the timer which is very nice whats nice about the timer function is that when you set the time you set it to when you want to serve it so you dont have to back anything out if you want to eat at  set it for  hours and itll be ready note the clock is in military time so if you dont know military time its easy but do remember theres no am or pm setting on this box  is noon  is  hours and so onwe are very happy with this unit i highly recommend itinduction junction whats your function"
8191,2,after  hours the camera corrupts the files and you lose access to all recordings the camera cannot stay connected to even remove the files corrupted or not the proper authentic top brand cards are being used exactly according to their requirements as usual drift denies any flaw in their product but if you search you will see many people have this issue i thought this camera would be an improvement over the three drift x cameras i have bought which all have defects firmware glitches  on the drift x that still allows rain water to leak inside and short out the electronics weak internal screw mounts that break constant resets and card formatting can help the firmware flaws but the problems always return on the drift xl customer service refuses to acknowledge the flaws and makes any kind of return impossible the cameras design in theory is great but in reality it is a constant headache and the company has a superiority complex and ego that is about to be humbled as their misrepresentations are exposed in numerous legal casesmy fourth drift camera and still major defects
8331,2,unfortunately this camera came with a broken front lens the selfie lens works fine and its pretty easy to operate so i gave it an extra star but not having a front facing camera makes this almost useless for our purposesfront camera broken 
3258,1,didnt know it was so small i had to purchase another cameracamera to small
7053,1,i bought this camera for a gift when opened it didnt even turned on asked for a replacement and it was quick and worked fine for a whileat first sight the camera looks good but not that good for the money paid kind of cheap a plus is the touch screen the bluetooth conectivity and just the portable printing featureid youre lucky and get a working camera you will get poor image quality lines all along the picture washed colors and all the disappointment it all bringsas said before the one im evaluating was already a replacement which failed just a few days after the replacement window had closed i had the same charging issue i had had with the first one the first came broken the second held up for two charges and just a few bad prints after that did not charge at all and stopped workingi wish i had paid attention to all the bad reviews this camera hasdo not waste your money its just trash
7287,1,it wont connect to my phone i cant do anything with the videos ive taken this is the first time ive used it since i got it and it just gets really hot when i have the wifi on and try to connect it i should have never bought a refurbished one  bucks down the draindisappointing
2333,2,this was a great idea of a camera my family loved it at first buuuttt after only a month the camera completely stopped working it turned off and never turned back on we tried everything dont waste your money and just get a instax minisave your money
9282,4,"i gave it  starts because the description is misleadingi didnt quite understood what the  small cup meant and i assumed a measuring cup was a standard measurementbut the rice cooker comes with its own cup that is about  of a standard measuring cup when they say  small cups what that really means is  cups capacity perfect for a  peoplei really like it but i end up returning it because it was too small for our family of  adults and  growing teensvery easy to use"
1843,1,i bought this for my daughter  months ago and now its not working feel like i just wasted  for nothingvery poor qualitystay away
7779,1,bought this camera for my sons birthday does not work comes on but display screen is just white and will not show anything wont take pictures nothing at all positive here will be returninga dud
867,1,play videocase doesnt fit the camera
13368,5,likegood construction
8837,1,i bought this camera for a once in a lifetime trip to morocco i travel for work and so did not open the box as soon as i got it as i was not home when i did open the box all seemed to be correct but then set off on another job assignment i got back home in november just in time to go on my trip and this is what i foundpros everything that was supposed to be in the package was there the product was nice looking as described and the  zoom function was fantastic the first photos i took as practice photos were fine on the included memory card my only complaint at that time would be that it did not come with a uv filter it took me about a week to find somebody that sold a uv filter to fit this cameracons intermittently i would get an error message on the view screen stating memory card not formatted format now  it would then go on to tell me that if i formatted the card i would lose all of my photos i would have to turn the camera off and turn it back on basically reboot for this message to go away the next time i would try to shoot the message would come back i would finally turn the camera off and resort to using my iphone which gave me beautiful photos but no  zoom i would try the camera again and i would be able to shoot four or five photos but when turning the camera off in between photo sites and then turning it back on i would get the same error message regarding formatting of the memory card and would be unable to take photos i would have to resort again using my iphone completely unacceptable i have just returned from my trip only to find out the exchange window is closedi dont think i will purchase from the seller againintermittent malfunction i
4426,2,i purchased this unit based on all of its wonderful reviews and elaborate description of its capabilities but as soon as i received i could not use it on my network my home wifi network broadcasts in  which this unit cannot use it can only use  per customer support i am rating the product low for this reason especially since nowhere in the product specs can i locate this information im highly annoyed that i cant find this out without contacting customer support i use  to connect all my devices because it makes the internet run faster on them its the only way for example that i can play netflix shows at an acceptable download speed so now i have two choice  return the frame or upgrade my router to a concurrent dual band broadcaster for about the same price as the frame itself ughwarning  does not use  wifi frequency
16709,2,"i really wanted to like this pot my friends joke that im one of the few only asians they know who doesnt use a rice cooker even my mom used a rice cooker when i was growing up but i married a nonasian who barely cooks but knows how to boil rice when he showed me how it was so easy so i just made rice on the stove for the past  yearsafter one burnt rice incident too many i was finally sold on the thought that i can program the rice cooking and avoid burning my house downcuckoo seemed like a good option good reviews not too big cute enought to sit on my counter not too expensive but not suspiciously cheap she arrived carefully and beautifully packagedi did not understand her buttons even after studying the manual so i decided to keep things nice and simple between cuckoo and i as we got to know each other wash rice in a different bowl drain pour rice into the rice cooker pot measure water wipe everything dry and pop everything into the cooker set sticky white rice  start seemed easy enoughfirst time i used it the jasmine rice cooked nicely second time i tried sushi rice and it didnt cook through could have been my mistake with measuring the water but i figured ill start understanding cuckoo better soon and things will improve third time i got an error midway theres no off button and the error beep would not stop i had to unplug then reset the cooking optionswell this should have been the point that i decided it was time for goodbye but no cuckoo and i continued like this with me trying to coax her and she sometimes obliging i thought she comes with a warranty maybe they can fix her i called the customer service line and got a kindsounding lady who didnt speak much english i finally understood everyone was out at lunch and i should call backa few days later i tried again and got someone who spoke a little bit more english my options were to ship them cuckoo i would pay for shipping and they would then figure it out and ship her back at this point i wasnt keen at at all in pouring more money into thisunfortunately i was  days beyond the amazon return window i hate the thought of tosing a  pot that barely lasted a month so i may just bite the bullet and send it back for repair in the meantime its just me and my trusty old quart pot and ill try not to burn the house down but really it is very easy to cook rice on the stovebarely lasted a month"
530,1,camera quit working right after the warranty window closeduspset with purchase
5925,1,very poorly made cheap two separate cameras stopped working in less than an hour the first one the screen stopped working and the flash stayed on when you took a photo the replacement that amazon sent didnt work any better and worked for about  minutes before no longer powering ondont waste you money
2342,1,my son just got to play with it for  hours and suddenly it stopped working  can i request exchange  please let me knowbas experience only for  hrs my son got to play
1785,1,i ordered this camera on feb   tried everything to get the flashing back to stop multiple times i watched at least  dofferent youtube videos ive changed my batteries  times nothing i cant even get the light turn white and flicker just stays orange the film counter says s and has not changed again ive tried everything possible ive also tried reaching out to fugi no response i wouldnt be surprised if they never even read the message guess im just stuck with a defective camera doesnt work
5586,1,very disappointed i dident receive anything but the camera its self i was very excited to receive how it was pictureddisappointed
14886,5,i always cook in stainless steel cookware and so i bought this for cooking riceour family is enjoying the rice cooked in it from the day i started in it the rice is not mushy and it is coming out fluffy and i am following the measurements given in the manuali have seen reviews complaining about the spill and i am not having any pblm like that as i leave some gap and i dont completely close the lid and i switch off the cooker once the rice is done so the rice is not sticking at the bottom i wish it had come with the lid without plastic inside of it other than that i love it good one
1907,1,bought this for my wedding to do a creative guest book it turns on but flashes fast meaning something is wrong went through all the workups and nothing  doesnt take a picture have wasted multiple films thinking it was the film have followed instructions to a t and did online research of issues nothing really disappointed in my purchase should have splurged for a bit more cost for a greater quality product defective doesnt work
6630,1,i have a coolpix  which has served me well for a number of years so i thought i would upgrade before a trip to europe i have had the camera for a week and the monitor stopped working half of the screen has become blank so i an returning the defective camera i leave in two days so i think i will go to bestbuy and pick up a decent canon may avoid nikon products nowdisaster
2726,1,takes blurry pictures does not compare to the sony camera we were using before as amazon stated would not recommendblurry pictures
17326,5,"i previously had a zojirushi  induction rice cooker that died on me after about  years of fairly frequent use i almost never made  cups at a time and the  cup model was a better choice for me i opted out of the pressure models because i knew that my older induction model made great rice and the pressure seemed like it would require more cleaningmade my first batch of jasmine rice my goto and it came out absolutely perfect my old rice cooker didnt have a jasmine setting but this one does and its really dialed in well and the keep warm setting worked well havent needed to use the keep warm setting for hours yet but i had times that i forgot to turn my old one off and the rice still looked great the next day so i think it will do wellimprovements from the old model this one gave me an initial estimate of  minutes for the rice and counted down the time the old one only told me when it was within  minutes of being done so this is helpful as it is i usually start the rice before anything else because it will keep it warm as long as i needone note from the previous rice cooker  the nonstick coating on my old rice bowl flaked off on the outside probably because i put it in the dishwasher so this new one is going to be strictly handwash but its really quick and easy to clean upwell see how this one ages but the rice is definitely better and ill be completely happy if it holds up as well as the last one didexcellent rice easy to use"
2238,2,i bought it for the  feature well thats lost money i had to buy the canon eos  to start making videos its  looks good for me im just starting but this one ill give it to my nephew to play wouldnt recommend unless you know what you are buyingi lost  usd
6408,2,its an ok camera if the pictures youre taking are not at all important the case is waterproof so thats a plus but the pictures and videos come out looking like an oldschool camcorder with a vhs tape grainy dull colors and any light white tshirts etc make a bright flash that overpowers the picturesterrible pictures
2812,2,theres a serious lag from when you press the button before the picture actually gets taken if at all i cant give this to a  theyll get too frustrated that the pictures arent being taken i think its trying to autofocus before it takes a picture but the lag is too long and when i even tried to take pictures it was aggravating to say the least just to take still pictures of items on a deskdoesnt take the picture at the press of the button
2452,1,given that i am going on vacation soon i wanted to take a camera that wasnt cheap nor too expensive upon finding this camera all the reviews seemed pretty positive until i received the camera and those positive reviews seemed to fly out the window the quality of the pictures are blurry and takes forever to focus there is not auto focus nor any sort of button to press to focus the quality of the camera is very plasticish and very light in weight and a major no no for me was how fast the battery was drained mind you i had just got the camera a day ago took a total of  photo testers and it is on low battery moral of the story dont buy this camera dont expect the best
2109,1,the camera doesnt works after the first  photo the lenss light star blinking we change the battery but they still blinking and the camera doesnt works i ordered it for christmas gift and my daughters was crying all the night thinking that it was her faultso disappointed and i need the wait for the return to get the replacementit is really too bad experiencethe carama doesnt works after the first use
9275,5,its very easy to use and the rice comes out awesomegreat rice cooker
5859,1,very disappointingmy iphone takes better pictures and has more versatilityyes it was cheapstill not worth itdisappointed
8055,2,i thought i had a faulty paper but all the pictures ive taken indoors are all underexposed and yes i use flash and the rooms are always well litfaulty camera
1018,2,the screen is out of focus but is a small camerahas a terrible fuzzy screen nice small camera but not worth the money
15478,4,"having had a lifetime of experience with rice cookers i think that i know what im talking about especially the no frills ones ive not ever owned a super fuzzy logic one that makes perfect rice but i am experienced with the dump some rice in rinse the rice cook the rice types of rice cookers the standout to me was that it is ceramic coated something that ive previously never used before after a couple of tries with it ive found that the surface is pretty easy to cleanfor cooking this is a fast rice cooker but it only holds two cups the included cup of long grain rice it boiled over the first time but was all caught on the lid and not down the sides i did end up leaving that rice on warm for a few hours and it did brown considerably i really wouldnt expect otherwise its such a tiny amount of rice that theres nowhere for the steammoisture to stay definitely use the rice quickly once its done and had a few minutes to sit if i wanted long term rice warmage ill pull out my  rice cooker thats the same price as this one from a warehouse club store and has the insulated lidoverall i think it is a nice rice cooker the price is probably my biggest issue with it i am not sure that the ceramic coating is worth the premium compared to similar models that are half the price with a nonstick surface this would be a  stars rating but ill have to put it down to  stars for how amazon ratings work definitely a good rice cooker option but be sure to do your researchrice rice baby"
8457,2,this camera takes terrible pictures anything outdoors is completely overexposed  faces turn out blank white or with just the barest hint of features indoors indirect light is somewhat better but still not great selfie mode again overexposes so dont use it the flash cannot be turned off and the claim to do autoexposure is just a joke some sites will tell you to cover the flash or put sunglasses over the lens to compensate for the overexposure but it only helps a little and jerryrigging in this way is a poor substitute for just making a better quality product focus is poor yes the camera is easy for kids to use and my kid was super excited to receive it and see photos popping out of the camera but its turned into a huge disappointment  half the photos are so bad that the moment you are trying to capture is completely lost really bummed that this cool idea is executed so awfullytakes terrible pictures
2682,2,we loved this little camera for our  year old it took surprisingly good quality photos and videos it was great until it stopped charging after  months since it wont charge anymore its useless and its past the return date my daughter is super bummed and were out  was great while it lasted
7786,1,terrible quality not useable by kids and picture quality is awfulterrible quality
258,1,had this since  and not taken even  photos i use my phone if i absolutely need a shot to workbeen using slrs since  other cameras before thatcomplicated and no way to easily step back when i make a mistake i have lost more photos fumbling with this cameracomplicated frustrating
17330,5,"so i had watched several reviews comparing the zujorushi rice cookers with cheaper models one in particular hot thai kitchen on youtube sparked my interest in maybe getting a japanese rice cooker more specifically a zojirushi so i did a lot of comparing features reading reviews seeing the best deals and ultimately settled on the  i knew i wanted a smart rice cooker with the neuro fuzzy logic built in i was also considerinf the added benefits of the induction heating and pressure cooking options after my research i decided i definitely wanted the induction heating feature but decided the pressure cooking feature likely wouldnt add a ton of value and would possibly overcomplicate user experience wating for the machine to depressurize so you can open it and overcomplicate the machine the pressure valves seal and everything related to that system seemed to be just more points of failure in the design i am sure it is engineered well by zojirushi but it only seemed to benefit the system most when cooking brown rice i cook white rice  of the time so decided id save  and bypass that featurewell fast forward to today my rice cooker arrived and i immediately unpacked it i read the directions which were straight forward and descriptive i had everything setup and cooking my first batch of rice in about  minutes i just tried the regular white rice setting once i pressed start the timer came up and indicated a cook time of about  minutes which is a while and one of the biggest complaints i see in reviews about the unit but just keep in mind this cycle includes a soak period cook time and rest time so when it is done you can be sure it is cooked optimally and ready to servei bought this as my significant other is chinese and we cook a lot of rice during the week we had been using a  aroma rice cooker it wasnt bad but the rice always just seemed off to me maybe it seemed a little wet or it was undercooked when i told my husband i was ordering a zojirushi rice cooker he didnt think we would honestly see that noticable of a differencewell this first batch of rice was absolutely perfect ill try to describe what i mean but you just have to experience the rice definitely wasnt wet when i opened the rice cooker there was just a bit of surface moisture from the steam on the grains as i mixed the rice any excess moister evaporated leaving perfect looking rice grains the grains were all cooked through with the middle of the rice being just as soft as the outside of the grain the flavor had definitely improved and there was just a nice chew and mouthfeel while eating it it complimented the main dishes better and no longer just seemed to be an afterthought but was part of the meal after eating a bowl my husband said he didnt think he could go back to the old rice cooker now we didnt even need to do a sidebyside comparisonyeah they zojirushi cooker is expensive for a small kitchen appliance but if you cook rice two to three times a week or more it probably isnt a bad idea to consider adding one of these cookers to your kitchen i certainly hope it proves to be durable and last for many years to come now i think i am going to be buying some brown rice to try in this and maybe even some oatmealvery noticable difference in rice"
6079,2,i found the instax camera to be awkward to hold awkward to take pictures with and produced blurry pictures i purchased a renewed instax but that should mean it would be better not worse i returned the camerathe pictures dont turn out clear
5030,2,the bottom is applied with two sided tape and will not stay onbought as a gift will not gift again
9240,1,i loved this camera so much i bought additional ones but one of them wont charge i plug it in and the red charge light starts to blink and the battery never fills which is disappointing the other  are amazing and always bring lots of laughs and fungreat when it works
9707,5,good quality works wellgood quality
5936,1,i need to return it it will not work for the purpose hopedwant to return it can this happen
14245,5,"five years ago in the fall of  i bought my first rice cooker it was one of the simple  dollar ones that you put your rice in flip the switch and hope for the best and honestly once i figured out what my ricewater ratio needed to be i got used to it and was completely happy with it even if i did have to wipe the counter clean when it boiled over and be satisfied that it might never be sparkly cleanbut oh my gosh i got this toshiba rice cooker and let me tell you i have never had a better ricecooking experiencethere was no more cleaning the counter off after an overboil there was no more having to unplug my rice cooker every time the rice was done there was no more wild guessing about my ricewater ratio and wait time once the switch flipped depending on how loud the ducks were quacking and which way the wind was blowing and how aligned the moon was with the stars that day this thing was perfectionthe modularity of it makes it super easy to clean and it actually gets completely clean every time not to mention you know every time exactly how long the rice will take to cook you can set a timer two timers actually for when you want your rice to be done it can actually keep the rice warm without burning it all over the sides and bottom and it will beep a happy melody to you my old rice cooker could never do that my old rice cooker just heated to its maximum and said when the water gone we good this one sings like a gameboy happy to just be alive and cook good rice this one gets methere are only two real negatives with this rice cooker that i can think of which arent really big deals first the power plug is on the right side which kind of stinks because i have it in a spot where its to the right of an outlet but its no big deal  the cord just wraps around easily second cooking anything other than rice in it tends to be a lot messier this sucker knows its rice like it knows the time of day and if youve been the victim of overboiling in traditional rice cookers youll wonder how you ever lived without this thing that barely even leaves water behind in the steam vent or on the top plate however when attempting to cook something like pasta or even a rice dish like mahatma yellow rice or knorr rice dishes it does more often than not boil up into the steam vent and leave a bit of a mess behind on the top plate these types of things can also get overcooked if you let them go the whole cycle so theyre something youve got to figure out with a bit of trial and error this isnt a big deal as again this rice cooker is mad easy to clean but it might leave you feeling like you should have just made your pasta or your knorr dish on the stove per their instructions i cant really consider this worthy of taking away a star though as its a rice cooker made for cooking plain ol rice but it is definitely something to keep in mind when you get it if you want to avoid a small messi highly recommend this rice cooker to anyone looking to improve their kitchen experience and having ready and reliably made rice available atwill this thing is the real deal and more than worth the price tag if you eat rice regularly an absolute fivestar product and experienceits so nice to finally have a real rice cooker"
9273,5,i like the rice cooker but it got dented when the amazon driver through it out of his truckthe rice cooker is perfect but the box was damaged on delivery
14096,5,the rice cooker is very cute and stylish its easy to use and easy to clean and is the perfect size for  persons and for use in a small space like a dormeasy and quick rice cooker
2278,1,i bought this camera for fun use and it worked until after the third use i didnt get that many pictures and it doesnt work at all i cant figure out how to return it and i have been stuck wasting  dollars on a crap cameraworst ever
877,2,double the price and you can get a real camcorder you can rely on if you care at all about what youre recording the picture quality is slightly above bad but not good enough for close ups of things nor does it have good stabilization i have had the issue many have had where a video over  minutes gets corrupted or stops recording i have also had terrible luck with the included mic attachment which looks neat but ended up removing all audio it might have been plugged in the wrong way but that would only be the case if the jack was damaged or of the unreliable kind you need to angle just right to get it to workthe infared feature does work pretty well and i havent seen it on many cameras the range is not far but if you want to make basic horror movie edits or take it for a night walk it will do the trick just use something else to capture audio completely separate from the cameraultimately if your kid wants a camera and doesnt do anything important or need the footage its an alright giftbasically a toy
9001,1,bought as gift for our daughter who lives in spain camera did not work now it is not possible to get it fixed in spain without paying basically the same amount or more to send it back will cost the same amount as well the insurance is not valid in spain waste of 
14793,4,"this is a great little rice cooker the removable pot is nice and thick only complaint is the displaylast pic doesnt light up at all but i didnt even think about it when ordering other than that i highly recommendthe  picture i put a grande starbucks cup next to for reference in size pic shows the dark display this unit has no lights on the displaygood rice cooker"
4707,1,doesnt read a  and  gb sd card on my samsung note  ultra also got warm after being connected to my phone for a few minutesdoes not read sd cards
13921,5,after years of not owning a rice cooker i finally purchased one and chose this model from toshiba the convenience of a rice cooker is being able to make rice or congee without worry of watching the stove i grew up making rice both with a rice cooker and stove top this model has the water marks in the pot for people to reference which is convenient but i think the water levels for cooked rice are more suited for shortgrain or mixedgrain rice which requires more water i make regular long grain or jasmine rice and i use the measuring cup that is provided and add  cup water so a little less than the  ratio as mentioned in the instructions when i first got this rice cooker i used the full cup of water for  cup of rice and it turned out a bit softer than i prefer so if you like a bit of individual grains use slightly less water the porridge feature is also good for making congee and the egg feature is convenient when you want to cook some eggs but dont want to watch the stovea great small size rice cooker
4639,2,convenient for transferring to computer via usb but transfer to cellphone via type c doesnt work device doesnt properly connect to phone and i cant manually override it in phone settings either i was counting on that feature in case i ever need to pull it up on scene because my dash cam doesnt have playback capabilitydoesnt work on phone
14263,5,"seriously though my wife and i are foodies we usually start cooking around  and sit down to eat around  and we love our food when we watched uncle roger make fun of people making fried rice he recommended this rice cooker wasnt sure if it was a joke but it was actually in his kitchen so we figured why not  of our  meals a week usually have rice in it and my boys are addicted to fried rice during this covid thingholy sh he was right you put in a cup of rice rinse it fill it to the pre marked line in the cooker hit a button and  minutes later you have beautiful rice seriously forgot you made it and leave the house and come back two hours later and notice the smell in the kitchen yeah the rice is still good need to make more rice yeah you put in two measured cups of rice and add water to line  it seriously doesnt get easier make  cups of rice but leave one in the pot by accident overnight ok it wasnt edible this is science not magic people however it just pushed right out with a paper towel and was instantly clean my wife said i still had to wash it but that is bs because it was clean i washed it anyways i dont want to be single like uncle rogerthe only con i can think to this we now eat rice  of the  days a weekuncle roger approved and now aunt helen will go back to him"
3389,1,the only thing i liked about this camera is that is prints on a roll of paper super convenient for a young child who wants to print lots of pictures and doesnt care too much about the quality of the print material other than that all of the design features are seriously lacking there is no selfie mode  you have to use a tiny mirror on the front of the camera which came scratched up even when you try to fit your face in the circle mirror the camera cuts of a huge chunk of your head as for navigating the screen there are no up and down arrows you have to guess which buttons also serve as those buttons but the camera is not consistent with which buttons also go up and down this makes navigating the menu and playing the little games difficult some of the games dont even work regarding picture quality there are many options for adjusting the clarity and gradient of the picture print out but adjusting them results in zero change in the quality of the photo print the volume is too soft to hear video play back or playing the games there is a volume button on the menu but even at its loudest you can barely hear anything lastly good luck even charging this thing the first time we charged it the camera worked after that we couldnt even get it to turn back onso many flaws
2678,2,the camera is a fun idea the execution maybe could have been a bit different in terms of ease of functionality this isnt something you could just figure out use of buttons without instructions i expected the image quality to be subpar but its a bit too challenging for a child to use which translate to loss of interest pretty quicklya bit confusing
7235,2,basicly the camera works as described no problem with the new one but i was replacing my earliergopro camera since it would no longer record video long conversations with help support and their conclusion was it was broken since it was older then one yr they at first offered no help then offered a  off in the process of preparing to send the camera back as the only way i could get the off price i thought it was quite strange that the support web site which offered a software fix which i had tried with the aid of the help desk giving me instructions still wouldnt fix it before i sent it back i figured out a different way to get the firmware to update which was close to the instructions but a bit different i was on an apple and i think the help desk wasnt as familiar with that computer it worked or at least seem to since i was in a rush due to an event coming up i sent my camera off upon receipt they did nothing to see if the camera was fixed and simply charged me for a new one  at a reduced price had they simply turned it on they with their experience would know if it was working we had long long help desk conversations i was completely frustrated and found them unresponsive and certain steps took days to complete i missed my event i really wanted my old camera back even if it was broken which by then i doubted but they couldnt find it and gave me the impression that they had thrown it away after only    hours after receipt hummm i now have two cameras which is what i wanted but my old one could have saved me buying a second new onedifficulty in getting effective support when out of warranty
2332,2,my daughter purchased this with money she had saved and loved this she has been using it a lot but shes not careless with it or rough with it by any means after only owning it a couple weeks the screen now freezes and when she opened it to replace what is essentially receipt paper that the pictures print out on a small plastic piece popped off and broke i dont think she can print pictures anymore its a shame that it was so cheaply made and made for kids nonetheless that it cant last even a month it wasnt the cheapest either shes really disappointed i personally wouldnt recommendfun and great concept but wont hold up for kids
10069,5,its a rice cooker and you can steam things too the steam basket is kind of small but it probably isnt as small on the larger size one it takes like an hour to cook rice which is a long time but it comes out perfect theres also the flash rice setting which takes like  minutes and is just the tiniest bit different but still fineit cook rice 
912,1,horrible quality and very short battery lifedont waste your money
5020,1,i bought this camera for my daughter and within a week the camera stopped taking pictures i was able to return it for a full refund i purchased a second one hoping it was a fluke it was not the same thing happened with the second i missed the return window and now im stuck with this expensive piece of junk ughthis broke within a week twice
3644,1,purchased several for an event one will not even print and no option to return or replacepoor quality printsabsolute junk
6820,2,camera took an acceptable picture not worth the money as it stopped working in a short period very disappointednot worth the money
6362,2,last second purchase went to tahiti my other gear was up in alaska so i purchased this it was inexpensive but i thought would work in a pinch for some snorkeling hopefully a few nice pics and video came in time for trip  days shipping boxed nicely fair amount of attachments looked reasonably sturdy loaded the micro sd card in it that i had laying around plugged into seat charger on the plane and off to tahiti was fully charged before i landed took one photo to see if it worked bingo first trip out less than  seconds in the water the case filled with seawater what a complete bummer on dry land you need a team of clydesdales to get it open in the water it flopped open the second i held down the power button the camera itself was getting extremely hot i dont believe the battery was enjoying the salt water i took it out of the waterproof case pulled out the battery let it dry out for  days in the room and nothing when i reassembled what can i say certainly not a go pro and for the price what could i really expect not sure if it was me or the camera box i really thought it was going to be a perfect little underwater camera one less thing to haul home from tahiti in the carryoni want to like this completly junk in  seconds
7180,2,i bought this because i didnt want a strap hanging around my neck and wanted the security of holding my camera in hand however i think this strap is more for a digital camera than a film camera once it was strapped on it was difficult to press the shutter releasedidnt work with my nikon fa
3195,2,i got this flash to do simple images and i like the remote idea however it seem to have a problem charging and goes through batteries fast like  are  images then the batteries need to me changed new battery show an icon that the batteries are low even with new batteries not sure what that abouti not very impressed i have gotten altura before and didnt have as many problem i do winter photos i really dont need my model freezing waiting to the flash to respondi will be returning this product no sure what happens to your product line but i had two altura flashes that work good well one stop working but the other lasted a very long timegoes through batteries to fast and sometimes it show low battery icon with new batteries
3038,1,with all the good reviews on this camera i was so excited for it to come in its absolutely terrible the quality of pictures are like a flip phone absolutely terribledont waste your money
3960,2,i ordered a ice blue camera and received a flamingo pink due to time constraints on the gift im keeping it but would have preferred bluereceived wrong color camera
869,1,we only received the camera and the case nothing elsenot what is pictured
9141,1,i charged the camera and tried it and was very disappointed i couldnt figure out how to get the battery or the memory card in the camera the instructions are not helpful i put the battery in wrong at first and its near impossible to get the battery or the memory card out of the camera i found the image photo quality to be very poor at least with the indoor lighting that i was using the camera makes a beeping sound every time you navigate the menu screen i did not see a way to turn that off i thought this would be a great deal for a quality camera i was wrongcheap camera
1166,1,very poor quality the quality is like that of an old android phone do not waste your moneypicture poor quality
3320,1,this camera is just not good ive tried every setting i could to get a better quality picture but every picture turned out grainy terribly lit and poor quality i didnt expect much but this is just plain sad would not recommendterrible picture quality
1075,1,i spent the last of my grant money to buy these cameras for my students beware before you buy thisturns out they are not rechargeable you have to put in their batteries which are standard nonrechargeable batteriesthere were no connector cords to the computer you have to buy those separately which i now cant dothey come without sd cards the camera will not work without an sd cardif you want a camera that does not come in working condition only then this is the one for younothing in their statement is correct
7215,1,if you have a nikon  which is admittedly heavy with its superzoom lens do not count on the buttonsnap on the wrist strap to protect your investment i learned the hard way would recommend latch hardware insteadwrist strap sucks
2119,1,dont buydidnt come with all the film that was promised
6636,2,the camera quality was not good not worth the money at all the pictures taken inside were super unclear and darkpoor quality  an iphone is better than this camera
3783,1,per the description this is indicating a  mega pixel capable photo and that is what drew me to this camera as well as the compact look of it and i was excited for this as i was wanting to use this for miniatures that i have painted but to my dismay when took a photo it was so grainy it looked like a color blind test and there is no focus option on the camera so everything up close was blurry and unrecognizable i even attempted to adjust lighting with ring lights and everything to see if it was a lighting issue but sadly it was not instant return would not recommend this camera to anyone ever not even as a starter camera to my  month old avoid pleasefeels like false advertising  photos look like a color blind test
5589,1,did not receive all of the filmsnot what it appears to be when ordering
5919,1,i bought a camera for a present for my niece and sent it to england but after printing the first photo the camera turned off and did not turn on again while it got so hot that it got burned when the lens was just closed the camera moves to the side of the stob to open lensbe carefully did not buy ot
7172,2,this product is well made but does not fit the canon  the base piece blocks the battery and card dooropening unfortunately i am returning it for that reasondoes not fit a canon 
1098,2,did not like the photos brightness was uncontrollable and photos come out ugly makes a good moment uglyum ok
3774,2,got this camera a few days ago and it was ok the first few feels very light like a toy and not even cute bad picture quality just straight up bad now it wont even turn on so will be returning save ur time and  and dont buydont buy
5212,1,i got this for my sister and it worked fine for a little but then the screen started freezing you couldnt turn it off and none of the buttons would work or anything and we had to wait for the battery to die for it to finally shut down the reset button doesnt exist and theres nothing we can do to get our money back or a replacementfreezes
192,1,this is my second canon camera great camera but the lens fell apart after the second use didnt drop it or anything took it out of the camera bag and it just fell to bits of course the return window is now closed this is the second photography item i have had an issue with from amazon the other was a led light wand to be used for light painting that was never receivedlens fell apart
1893,1,everytime you take a picture it comes out white like its over exposed and you cant return itdoesnt work
920,1,terrible audio and video quality do not purchasedo not buy
5502,1,we bought this camera april   and it hasnt worked for the last year or so unfortunately past the time i could return it i kept trying to follow utube videos to see if i needed to set it differently and it just got worse it wont focus in on anything just a blur of color it was hard and very frustrating to set up in the beginning but at least we were able to take pictures with it now its totally useless and were back to using a camera we bought in april of  which is a cool pix  it still works except the battery has to be taken out when not in use or it runs down thats why we originally bought this camera but the old one at least still works i just have to remove the battery i would not recommend this camera to anyonequit working after a couple of years
8680,2,dont waist your moneynot worth it
678,1,this is a terrible camera this does not record in any resolution even close to  and when you try you get like  fps this might be a fine camera as a toy for a kid in elementary school but it cant be used for anything where quality matters it also does not have actual zoom its only digital the lens that comes with the camera doesnt do anything when you turn it as far as the focus goes it simply screws off the knobs are fake and just look like they actually do something but they do not dont say your product does something when it does not this product description should classify as fraud imomisleading
5054,2,its a cool kit but by the  picture we took we realized something was wrongyou stick your finger on the button to snap a pic and the light meter starts flashing and it wont take a pic at all you press the button and it does nothing i have troubleshooted for weeks trying to fix it because i lost the gift receipt done research even switched the batteries and tried various films at first every other photo taking session would kind of work it would be good for  pictures and then it just stopped working completelyshe doesnt workso buyer be wareagain the kit is really cool and it might be a fluke that it was slammed in transit or something but it was massively disappointinggreat kit but camera itself arrived broken and got worse from there
7697,1,this is a kids camera you would think it would be reinforced the screen broke off the back the next issue is the button wouldnt click down so when we pushed it no photos were takendo not buy i only got photos the first half of our vacation because it broke broke after a few days
10633,4,love itrice cooker
11092,5,i love this rice cooker im able to cook just the right amount of rice and it doesnt take up a bunch of space on my counter its so simple to use its the perfect sizelove it
9293,5,never owned one didnt know what i was missing out on this pot is wonderful easy to use easy to clean  and it works greatlove love love this
5021,1,the girls wanted it for christmas i dont see why the big deal other than scrapbooking polaroids from way back took better  larger pics imo scrapbooks are a dime a dozen like hobby lobby dang they got cell phones  fb get a disposable camera develop them  make collages at  less the cost another fadreally not worth it but kids wanted one a fad that will be forgotten by next year
3635,2,package was suppose to contain  boxes of film i only received three boxes of film i reported the missing film and i have not received the two boxes of missing filmmissing film
6090,1,very disappointed in this bought for my wedding in a couple of weeks and its so messed up looking looks worse in person i dont even want to set it outdirty and covered in scratch marks
4232,1,the camera does not take good pictures i thought the quality would be great but before this i was using my samsung  and it takes excellent photos comparison to this camera sorry its a dud for mequality is not there
1099,2,this camera is super low quality the battery doesnt last longbad
10518,4,it does cook about  to   cups of cooked rice nicely but if try to cook a full  cups of cooked rice it pushes the lid up causing a mess this is okay for me as im the only one i cook for but still dislike the deception on the descriptionnice little cooker but not quite a two cupper
2422,2,i wound up returning it the video and audio quality was not good i made sure to put it on the highest video quality and it was quite poor quality really grainyvideo and audio quality was not good
8914,1,camera does not charge contacted amazon received dec  attempted to use feb  amazon states the warranty expired jan  wow not even  days no more online electronics for me  will go back to purchasing at a store where they can demonstrate that the product worksarrived inoperative
6758,1, trash product keepit moving aint no way in hell this is what u want when shopping for what you neednot what u want
14273,4,cooks white and brown rice beautifully with fuzzy logic very disappointed it doesnt have the option to convert the clock from military time to standard time especially when it appears on the face of the cooker  option of standard time instead of miltary
3199,2,dont buy this product if you decide that you are going to use it on a canon rebel  or  the new ones they do not have a center shoe contact point for the remote the flash works but the remote wont although why purchasing is it states it is for the eos rebel  and  but the remote really is notwont work for the camera it says its for
1123,1,it says its a  camera but theres no possible way i tried using it as a webcam and the quality is completely horrible the return window closed on amazon unfortunately so i guess now im stuck with this save your time and moneynot good quality
7340,1,this product is a complete infuriating waste of money and time it is not easy to use it takes hours to get adjusted and in my case days as i tried to enlarge the image using my laptop didnt work in order to enlarge the image by their instructions it would require  foot arms to reach the paper youtube was no help either as their are mixed opinion as to whether this works also due to unforseen circumstances i couldnt get it returned before the allotted  days and it now resided in my garbage can wont resell it as i dont hate anyone enough to wish it on themdont waste your money
12300,4,i am very pleased with the product however the box came without a measuring cup and the box it came in was a little damageddelivered on time but no measuring cup
1355,1,do not buy this camera expecting any kind of reliable picture taking it has been reviewed by thirdparty sources and shown to be highly subpar perhaps to the point of not even being worth  have not seen this product in person so take this as you will but i do not believe that its rating is reflective of its qualitydo not expect any quality
5965,1,this camera simply did not work it flickered the first time we opened it then died i put it on charge for two days the led sat on red never changed to green never turned on dead on arrival sent back utter and total waste of money 
1521,1,the quality is not that great and mine came scuffed on the side its like a camera from  definitely returningnope
5941,1,cannot get this camera to print everytime i try its says misfeeding can i return for a refundmines a dud
10013,5,my husband and i had a cooker that we got as a gift that always had rice that stuck to the bottom and hardened this rice cooker is amazing weve cooked rice a ton of times now and it always comes out perfect weve also done dumplings that came out delicious so overall would buy againwhat a great little cooker
8553,1,unfortunately ive returned this item because it was missing a battery and battery charger to tell you the truth i was really disappointed from what ive got the items box wasnt original and the packaging was poor frankly im afraid this item is a fake camera also the leash was very cheap and didnt look at all like if you bought it from the storeim really not satisfied i planned to start my trip in new york with this camera and unfortunately i couldnt even use it because it was missing a batteryprobably a fake camera
5235,1,not well constructed for its intended purpose at least not for me i wouldnt trust my equipment in it due to flimsy padding not a firm bag line the tenba cooper linenot at all impressed sending it back
7734,1,the goodnext day shippingeasy returns at kohlsthe badthe sd that comes with it does not workthere are no instructionsit has a selfie camera but there is no way to use itit is really loudthe disappointment on your childs face when you have to take their garbage toy away because it is too expensive for a play camerathis is the worst purchase i have made on amazon check the fakespot reviews of products before purchasingwow its that bad save yourself the hassle of returning do not buy
10474,5,it feels like my daughter asks for rice every day after getting this cute little rice maker it definitely does a better job than i did with a pot and is quicker too super easy to clean and small enough to easily tuck away it is big enough for two of us when preparing dinnerso cute  more importantly so easy to use
17592,5,my first foray into a quality rice cooker and i was not disappointed ive never had a bad batch of rice using this cooker the timer function has let me experiment with letting the rice soak before cooking and a few other fun things thank you uncle rogerabsolutely worth the money
9034,1,the camera i received was obviously a return that had been used dirty prints on the front and the screen the printer and paper had been used because i could see where the paper was torn off pieces missing markers were the only item received with the camera wish id chosen a higher quality disappointed
6223,1,im amazed at all the positive reviews i have seen for this product because mine has been nothing but impossible to work with garbage the clear plastic back part through which you are supposed to be able to see your camera screen is covered with some kind of smudgy fog that does not wipe off there were absolutely no instructions of any kind as to how you are supposed to fit this on or around your camera there were a couple of loose velcro straps that werent attached to anything dangling down inside the package but absolutely nothing telling you what they were four or where they were supposed to attach in the short this product is a complete aggravating waste of money and you would be better throwing your cash in a trashcan before wrapping your camera in a simple garbage bag and using that insteadim amazed at all the positive reviews i have seen for 
11214,5,i was surprised how well it works and it makes a lotworks well
4879,1,the camera may be ok but the case was in a plastic bag when we took it out of the bag it was covered in black mold and it had a terrible odor we dont need to return the camera but the case is totally unusable that made the gift much less appealing for our  year old granddaughtermolded case
430,2,the charger that came with this camera does not charge the battery in this camera i havent been able to use this camera once since purchasingmissing charger
2367,1,i am returning this camera because most of my pictures were overexposed in all kinds of light and several were off center i wasted a lot of film trying to get this right i dont want a camera for which getting the right exposure is such a finicky processcould not get a good exposure
183,1,i dont know what i bought until i purchase a sd card never have i had this happen with any digital camera ill have to review later big dissapoint 
206,1,do not buy this camera buy a  while you still can canon purposely built the new  without the center sensor in the hot shoe up top so it will not work with any aftermarket accessories without that center pin you can only use expensive canon accessories with this camerathe  has the exact same digic  processor as this camera and the exact same features across the board except for an  megapixel sensor instead of the  megapixel sensor in the  will you ever notice that difference having shot professionally and as a hobbyist for more than  years no not unless youre making prints intended for billboardsyou might not think its a big deal but trust me you will want to add a speedlight to this camera some day and then youll be confined to having to buy a  canon flash instead of any  aftermarket flash which works just as well the same holds true for flash triggers strobe remotes everything canon is really screwing people with this camera and ive been a faithful canon user all my life and always will be but do not buy this one you will regret it buy a  insteaddo not buy this camera buy a  while you can
4720,1,my daughter initially loved this camera i gave it to her for her  birthday she took several pictures and printed off about  photos after that the printer stopped working the quality of pictures is average at best but for her it was fine im not sure what happened but it just stopped working for  i expected it to at least work and last for more than  dayprinting stopped working during the first day
5049,1,it came brokendidnt work
7102,1,picture quality is terrible have had old camera phones that can take pictures of better qualitypictures are often blurry and the colours appear washed out one had streaks running through itterrible product avoidhave sent it back and now awaiting a full refund from amazon 
2763,1,wont save pics to camera or memory cardcamera
5297,2,so far i can only use the camera by looking through the lcd screen for some reason the viewfinder is blurry im no professional photographer but i have never had one that was this blurry and could not be adjusted i cant tell that the adjustment is doing anything at first i thought it was my vision looking at something close up  but a photographer friend of mine checked it out and said he saw it the same way other than that i really havent gotten to use it enough to make a better evaluation but so far im unimpressedviewfinder is blurry out of the box
393,1,the camera was not able to take micro pictures camera stopped working 
17586,5,"iwe eat a lot of rice i have used a zojirushi neuro fuzzy maker for almost  years while putting it away a few days ago it slipped out of my hand fell to the floor and the base cracked into several pieces with no hope of fixing it i went looking for a replacement i was just going to get another neuro fuzzy but this induction heating one caught my eye and i got it instead i did not think that the rice would be that much different out of it as the neuro fuzzy made some pretty good rice but i was wrong this thing makes rice that tastes much better than what i have had i made the first batch today using the same nishiki rice same amount same washing same ro water identical settings to what i had used just  days ago in the neuro fuzzy the only difference was the cooker i am impressednegatives are no retractable cord and it looks like they still have a non user replaceable clock battery i did replace the one in the nero fuzzy once but it is not for the faint of heart you must take the unit completely apart and solder directly to the circuit boarda very good rice maker"
14308,5,we got tired of how messy and slow our last rice cooker was so we upgraded to this one the digital display tells you exactly how much time is left until your rice is done we have only used it for white rice so i cant speak on the other settings but we really enjoy having itan excellent rice cooker
7857,2,the software is jacked my wife and i both tried the android and the ios version on our phones over and over again and couldnt get the printer to print more than one picture before getting an error not only that but to clear the error the only reliable way was to delete and reinstall the printing app on our phone sometimes we were able to get to print one more photo by turning off the printer closing the app on our phone and running the blue card again through the printer is that really something you want to do every time you want to print one photo yes perhaps we should of kept the printer and prayed that they would fix the app eventually we just returned the printer too frustratingoverall the pictures were a cute size but the prints were also strangely off dark and the compensating for the darkness resaturated i would expect more from kodak brand if that was a setting in the app we didnt see a way to turn it off so not like it was some sort of old timey polaroid effect you could turn off and on like instagram in your pocket that would be a cool feature but the frustration of the app was not worth hoping that whatever third party they hired to make the app would wake up and repair itnever able to get to print more than  picture
6439,1,it states  video up to  fps but this is actually  fps and  is  fps not very good business here regrets for me i guess picture is  and is shows video is useless at  fps good luck allanother false advert slipped through the cracks
8953,1,you can not get a replacement battery nor can you get support for the camera i do not recommend the purchase as i now have a dead camera and no way to get a new battery i have ordered batteries and they do not fitno support
7081,1,this camera feels like a cheap toy the touch screen is on the film access door and is difficult to use the menu options are over simplified and lacking basic options like cancel print or load film the app and the camera are not pairing the worst thing is that the picture quality is poor the colors are washed or blue in one case and there are printer lines visible on the photo received as a gift and want to return as it is garbage amazon say i cant as i already opened how else do you know that the product doesnt do what it was advertised to do disappointed in kodak and amazon for selling and not taking responsibilityworst amazon purchase ever poor quality pictures cheap material cant return 
7146,1,i was only given one set  sheets of film wheres my other seti was only given one set  sheets of film wheres my other set
7740,1,i tried for hours to understand how the camera worked as the the instructions were very poor my grown son tried too and either we missed something or the camera just didnt work but i returned the camera as i couldnt give something to a  year old that two grown adults couldnt get to workdifficult to use
2007,1,horrible productcamera
3012,1,worked for about a month then wont take pictures tried battery replacement everything this is the second one first ine came not workingdoesnt work
5460,1,i guess for  what more could we expect we read the ratings  and there are a lot of them on amazon  and thought we were purchasing a great  camera to replace our canon rebel  which at this point is over  years old released february  no just no theres no comparison between these cameras and a true dslr if i want a pointnshoot camera why would i want one this huge with far less features than even a regular  theres no audio input so right there shouldve warned me off this camera you cant hook up an external mic to this camera and they dont even bother telling you that because they know its such a basic feature that to mention it would crush the sales of this camera bad move  the touchscreen doesnt swivel out and around sure theres an app but wouldnt it be easy and inexpensive to offer a pivoting lcd screen how much more cost could that  the   video capture is abysmal quality i have a logitech streamcam  and it has demonstrably better picture quality and color depth than this piece of trash lumix  pictures arent much better folks its one thing to advertise  but the quality of the  matters as well more pixels doesnt always equal better picture quality this cameras quality is crap our  canon rebel  has better picture quality at  camera is  retail  what are you paying for less features trash  videopicture quality no thanks plus the quality of the camera itself is poor its very very light and doesnt feel very solid we will never consider purchasing another panasonic camera again stick with nikon or canon theyre the best and theres tons of reasons whynot as good as the ratings would suggestbig letdown
3906,2,camera is great but half of the film weve used so far has been trash we will get one cartridge that the photos come out fine on and then the next cartridge doesnt develop not happy that most of the film is bad so i am giving this package deal  stars for bad film film is bad
7699,2,really great for a toddler camera but after only one day of using it it completely stopped working and would not turn on again i tried charging it again thinking it was only just dead but gave it a full charge and still will not turn onmy  year old was loving it and super easy for her to use until it all of a sudden stopped working
2575,1,cord caught fire as soon as i plugged it in wasnt able to use it at all dont know if it was the cord or the camera itself but something is broken and needs to be fixedfaulty product
1359,2,this camera is really a onetrick pony that they try to market as a full use camera if you need  footage sure this is probably the best quality you will get but their desktop app sucks so youre stuck to your phone which has limited output options  only or going super deep into premier pro to edit the footagethe videos are not very sharp and are grainy even my wife was like what is wrong with the final video not even close to the quality of even a gopro or iphone and its not  that is before you reframe it then you end up with  footage which is very poorly explained on their ridiculous marketing materials they are giving these out like water to youtubers and instagramers so its no wonder there are so many positive videos everywherejust know what you are buying and the limitations since it took me weeks of testing this fully to finally understand what the pros and cons of this thing are there are situations where it is super cool for sure but if doing static shots use something much higher qualitygood for  footage but overall quality is very low
13775,5,i bought both the zojirushi neuro fuzzy  cup and the toshiba low carb because i wasnt sure which one to get the toshiba cooks rice perfectly either in the lowcarb mode or one of the regular modes it has a countdown timer which the zojirushi doesnt have its smaller and i like the design better i am very happy with the toshiba so i kept it and returned the neuro fuzzy hope this helps you decideso glad i picked this one
11070,5, as the title states this isnt a bad product for the price cooks rice quickly pan is relatively nonstick does it function as well as my cuckoo or zojirushi did no but its also also  of the price takes up very little counter space too the rice does get toasty a bit on the bottom and i dont let it sit on the warm function for long unless im wanting some roasted rice for a porridge later the steam function is okay but it holds a small amount and is rather shallow so i have to cut the pieces of broccoli or cauliflower smaller does well for potstickers and the like the one thing that i really hated was the lack of an onoff button i dont like having to plug and unplug it after each use as i use it multiple times per week but i solved that with an outlet cover that has an onoff switch built innot bad for the price
14771,5,i have had a cheap as you can find rice cooker for years well it died and i had no idea what i was missing so i started reading reviews and then had to decide what was on my budget cuckoo cooker was my final decision its cooks rice so much better i had no idea what i was missing tons of options i doubt i will use it makes brown rice just perfect the reheat function is amazing plus you can set everything up use the timer function and wake up to perfect rice for breakfasti love it
14098,4,theres no way i could make  cups of rice in this adorable rice cooker if you are single it would be the perfect little cookervery nice and well made but tiny
6098,1,came today but doesnt work tried everything new batteries and  different packs of film an still nothingstarted my refund very disappointed due to it was a giftdidnt work
1582,2,crapspend a little more on better producthorrible quality
7217,1,the snaps unsnap super easy will not trust to put on my camerakeeps unsnapping
17352,5,"i replaced the old handmedown  min rice cooker from the  still functioning greative wanted a fancy rice cooker for  years but could never justify the expensetheres no way this new one could last that long w ic but thats okthe new rice cooker makes rice that tastes amazing in comparison i still wash it several times first so maybe its actually more about the texture sushi rice jasmine rice yellow rice unit is very easy to clean  fits under the overhead cabinets even when the popup lid is open the keep warm function is pretty awesome   hours later yes its still steaming hot  tastes maybe even better  hours later still quite good it makes the best rice at  cups the little plastic spoon with bumps works great the little song it plays when finished will make you dance for rice so good i bought a second one for the office why did i wait so  minutes to cook rice  and yes its actually worth it"
4849,1,camera failed after two weekspass on this garbage spend the money and get a better polaroid camera that lasts
4438,2,i had a dragon touch and was frustrated with freezing and picture orientation issuesi returned that and got this oneno touch screendoesnt play videos  when it does there is no sound or they are upside down but usually will crashresoulution is middling at bestfor the price of a low end tablet or chromebook its disappointingnot impressed
2173,2,at first i loved this portable photo studio my pictures seemed so simple for my listings the amazon app gave me pretty little green approvals letting me know the picture quality was good and all seemed fine i was using a new iphone  so the quality was excellent then to my dismay i shipped a bunch of the newly photographed merchandise to the fba warehouse only to have item after item frozen for poor image quality after dropping month to purchase this box to help me avoid this very problem i am pretty bummed and frustratedthe box itself is great but beware i just thought cause it was an amazon box working with the amazon app that all would be well but so far it has not been love the concept but the results so far are not great for me at allat first i loved this portable photo studio
14734,5,"after a long research i got myself a cuckoo rice cooker in germany now my parents liked my rice and therefore i offered this nice cuckoo to them nearly the same modelmy criteria were not too large i would rather cook twice in one evening rather than having a huge rice cooker no glas lid had one and was a mess to clean each time amount of modes glutinous porridge quality of finished rice not too expensive we only eat rice from time to time and dont need a cool hitech cookeralthough i dont speak korean the buttons are labelled as well in english  no problems to use the menu quality of rice convinces me i love cuckooi love my cuckoo rice cooker"
11924,5,"i spent a few thousands of dollars on cookers convectional ovens ninja hotpots cermaics magnetic cooking all kinds of things they are not as good as zojirushi at allim writing this because ive been cooking full meals its not just ricepork beef chicken lamp goat fish ive cooked all kinds of things in this ive steamed veggies or even threw in the veggies at the end of the cooking and it was all done perfectlyive just made a soup with rotini and it did not over cook the pasta at all ive pretty happy at first i did not get it because i thought i could get a cheaper cooker but you get what you pay for i dont get paid by giving this review but this cooker is  stars out of i will say it again its not just for rice soups sauces you can steam veggies and im willing to bet i can make bread in it too hope you get one and enjoy oh the cleaning its super easy to clean and things dont burn in it not that ive had so far excellent productget it"
7732,1,bought this for my grandson for christmas glad i checked it before i gave it to him first i couldnt get it to work then when i did it is so complicated i dont see how a  year old will be able to manage picture quality is horrible i will return this and found a better one hopefully i guess its true you get what you pay fordont buy
12726,5,i have been on a making my own fried rice journey i have used a cheaper  rice steamer and it worked but the rice was always a little crispy on the outer edges i finally bit the bullet and purchased this even though it was a new model and had no reviews no regrets no burned rice does exactly as it should and i have used it a ton absolutely love itlove it replaced a cheaper one different brand
2544,2,my daughter loved this camera it was probably her favorite gift for christmas however after  days it quit working it would not turn on unless plugged in you cant print photos while its plugged in eitheri contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement we had a great time with it for a day the battery died charged it and it quit workingso i give up im returning the whole thing and not asking for a replacement just my money backi give up weve gotten two and the both stopped working within  days
590,2,it worked well for a little bit took some very fun pictures and has a vintage look no flash on it and doesnt state the date but easy to transfer to computer without adaptor but now i am taking pictures and nothing is saving and i waited too long to return it because it was broken so i wasted my money stopped working after few times of use
10499,5,"i love this rice cooker ive had it just for a few days but really like it i made jasmine rice that turned out great and then tonight i followed their recipe for mac and cheese and it turned out so tastyi will say that this rice cooker is very very small i live alone so its great if youre cooking for one but if i were cooking for even two people this would not be large enough its great if you only need it for one person and since its so small its easy to find a place to store it and doesnt take up hardly any space on the counter at all this thing is really just the size of a very large soup bowlsome people complained about the end result not turning out well and i think its probably confusion over the instructions first off you have to cook everything according to the booklet that comes with the rice cooker second when they say a cup or half a cup whatever of something they mean the cup that comes with the rice cooker not a standard size measuring cup also i think the line on the inside of the machine is totally off i would just ignore it and use the included measuring cup insteadthe other thing to be aware of is that this thing starts to heat up as soon as you plug it in and it will continue to warm until you unplug it so in my opinion this is definitely a fire hazard if you dont watch it closely i would never feel comfortable leaving this thing somewhere where i wasnt within the same vicinity so i could smell it if it started smoking if you want something that you can truly walk away from get an insta pot or a crock pot that being said i already have an instapot but dont use it very often because its so big and heavy to get out and takes up a lot of space on the counter this thing feels a really nice niche that its small and very easy to use for a quick meal for one i highly recommend it and im really happy i bought itupdate have had this a while longer and still love it successfully made white jasmine rice brown rice quinoa and mac and cheesei cant believe i can make mac and cheese in a rice cooker"
6893,1,sadly this stopped working for me i only got to use it once the first use worked great continuous recording i was impressed with the picture and sound even in a darker room but when i went to use it again it only showed me the first  seconds and then froze ive cleared the sd card and tried multiple times on both continuous record and on motion detection but no matter what when i go to play it back on my computer it freezes after the first  seconds and causes my computer to crash im too scared to try again for fear it will destroy my laptop huge waste of money i was really hoping this would work so disappointed it only worked one timebeware stopped working after first use  and trying to corrupt my computer
8777,1,i bought the camera for my trip to barcelona to catchmemories i got the exact opposite took a picture and it did not even show just a black picture im very disappointed in the quality this was my first time purchasing a polaroid so its a big disappointmentbe cautious when buying
6054,1,unfortunately it stopped working after the second time i charged itworked for  charge cycles
2343,1,worked great for the first few hours but then screen froze and we couldnt turn it off and back onpurchased  as gifts for siblings both froze and couldnt be restarted on first day of use
5798,2,this camera is not for left handed people all controls are on the right side when i pick it up with my left hand my thumb puts my finger prints on view display then of course i transfer canera to my right hand i also am looking for a shutter attachment when i zoom in very close i find it very hard to hold still yes it is on a tri pod and a very good one but when i push the shutter button the camera moves slightly just enough to off set the center of the my subject returning this item mainly because it is totally set up for right hand peoplenot set up for left handed people
892,2,i tried to use this camcorder to make an instructional video dont waste your money the external microphone made a constant buzzing noise on the recording no matter what i tried moving the mic farther away with a longer cable turning off all other electronics in the room etc the builtin mic worked ok but the quality of the sound was mediocre at best worst of all were the horrible images when using the zoom again nothing helped moving farther back just made it worse all that i got were fuzzy images where you could not see any detail at all plus the manual was worthless it had been badly translated from another language and contained almost no information on the many settings i just had to try them all to see what they did and the touch screen was badly designed requiring you to go back to the home screen every time you wanted to look at something elsehorrible image quality
1835,1,bought these for xmas kids used them about  times orange light blinks when they try to take a picture even though i replaced the batteries and its happening on both cameras which means the product is defective hoping customer service can helpstoped working after few uses
7060,1,no it dies before you even get a second photo out it wont connect to android the picture quality is awful and the pictures are much smaller that expectednope
3897,1,takes dark photos the preview screen shows a version of the photo but when i upload photos they came out dark audio was shoddy when i recorded video  of my photos from vacation arent salvageable the reviews here lied if you take day time photos they have potential for clarity and beauty but that is allnot great
2031,2,did not receive film in this bundle just cameradid not receive film
4067,1,before i start i did research arlo for hours over a weeks time before making my purchase if you are serious about security and you test your equipment to make sure that it is providing the security option you expected you need to read thisarlo is not ready to be a security camera it is easy to setup but then comes what netgear does not tell you the pricey batteries run down fast and the camera only records up to  minutes with a suggested energy savings time of  seconds along with a  second lag time before it starts recording when the motion feature is engaged and you really can not use it as a regular camera because if you do your batteries will run down in a few days to week as my batteries ran down to  as of  and i started using the system  i tested inside for a short time and then move it to the back patio entry using the motion detection option last but not least the push notification was working on both my android and my wifes android and now notifications are only working on my wifes androidi love the concept the recordings are very clear and the camera handles the rain fine but lets face it for indoors you can get a more reliable and a lot less expense motion night vision wireless camera with smartphone app and even for actually a  of the cost so arlo makes more sense as the first outdoor completely wireless security camera except it costs a lot to buy and operate and you may or may not get a push notification that something is happening when your away from homewhat bothers me even more is that netgear is aware of all this and more if you look at all the feedback and reveiws and they also know that most buyerscustomers will not figure it out in less then  days return expire date and like me they will try hard to make the system work because it is so cooli can not return it because im  days pass the cut off i can not sell it because i am online seller with a perfect record and i can not afford to hurt my selling reputation with a product that i know does not work correctly the short record time and the recording lag i can live with but replacing lithium batteries in less then  months and not getting notified when the motion is set off makes it useless there are more reported flaws in the system according to others if you read the questions and answers and the reviews above is only what i have experience in less then  dayson top of all that is my wife and i spending many hours over the past month or so trying to make it work i can not recommend this system to anyone and i do not feel as good about netgear as i once did when a company knows that their product has a large amount of flaws or misconceptions by customers on how to use the product then they should provide a more detailed description with full disclosure of this information so that the consumer can make a more informed purchase i would never want one of my customers to feel like i feel now about this purchasejust a pretty package too many flaws to be a camera security system
6003,1,waited extra long for this package to arrive and when it did arrive only the gopro case was there inside was an empty spot for the battery and gopro itself my  year old son earned his money to buy it himself and was super disappointed after waiting forever then to have an empty case not a happy camper now we are in the process of returning an empty case to get our money back to go elsewhere to buy one makes a lot of sense 
8378,1,not sure if its the paper or the camera but of the  photos i took only  actually created a photo and  came out blank the remaining shots never produced anything not even a blankim really disappointed in kodakdisappointed
1787,1,i held on to this camera for over a month experimenting with varying light sources subjects etc i went through a few packs of film only to really get a handful of identifiable imagesbiggest issues taking photos outside in natural light was impossible the exposure was so blown out that nothing showed up in frame the shutter consistently jammed so i dont know if that was causing the lack of image or if that was what was affecting the exposure or what all i know is that it was a crapshoot each time i used the camera that little diamond knob with sticky backing is completely useless it doesnt work i returned my camera via usps and it arrived at their location for a refund a while back the seller has yet to respond to my email about receiving the item and so i opened a claim with amazon for the refund so ultimately communication was nonexistentpretty disappointed in my overall experience with this as im such a sucker for polaroids im going to attempt a previous make and model to see if its any better the  i thinkwish me luckoverexposed  stuck
1731,2,brought the camera and the suggested memory card and case in one purchase when the items came the memory card was not a micro sd card so i couldnt use it received the case and the camera doesnt fit in it so bewaredont buy the suggested bundle
2702,1,i am a professional photographer and bought this toy camera as a christmas gift for my smart  year old granddaughter fortunately i tested it before i gave it to her and it failed the test followed all instructions but could not get it to take or record a picture it gave the impression of taking a picture but nothing was recorded on the card so there was nothing to view tried removing and replacing card resetting and rebooting several times to no effect connected the camera to my computer so i could see the contents of the card and saw that nothing was recorded on the card correctly ejecteddisconnected camera from my computer and the camera screen froze and became inoperable reset camera boxed it up and returned it to amazon  that was the easiest part of the this very disappointing experiencedefective outofthebox
7282,2,im sure this is a great gadget to have for sports and pov action but i wanted a waterproof video camera for my outdoor adventures like hiking and camping it felt like a toy and with the waterproof case the audio is completely uselessdont get me wrong its a great gadget easy setup it just didnt work for what i was going to dodidnt work out for me
4447,1,i have loved pix star frames over the years had purchased around  so far but this new model is designed so poorly it boggles the mind you can no longer hang these horizontally on the wall indeed they have mounting holes on the back  but they are three inches off center so there is no way to use them there is simply no excuse for such poor design defects the previous generation had perfect mounting holes and screws in the back perfectly aligned for both vertical and horizontal hanging this new generation seemingly placed the hols in random spots ensuring there is no way to properly hang them this is just a design flaw plain and simpleimpossible to hang horizontally
1677,1,i thought for  it would be a good compact camera for personal use but its genuinely not worth it at allits comes with a lot of stuff batteries sd different lenses but it doesnt matter because the camera itself feels very cheap and light and the quality is unbearable the focus and the flash features dont work well at all the app that connects to the camera via wifi is also very slowif youre looking for a cheap camera the  seems like a good deal but it is not i would rather spend a little more money for a better onedont recommend
14285,4,so far ive only made brown rice in this  it came out great but i found several things about the instructions were unclear to me does white rice refer strictly to the basic longgrained white rice or does it include others also like white jasmine  white basmati can you cook those can you cook those on the quick cook cycle can you use the steamer basket with any settings other than the quick rice setting or can i steam fish while cooking brown rice my first attempt at that didnt go so well so i was extremely pleased with the rice but feel the manual needs a little more consideration for those of us who are newbies to fuzzy logic cookersthe cooker looks sturdy seems wellmade and was easy to clean the keep warm setting is great the handle to make moving it to a serving area is a nice feature toogood rice confusing instructions
7318,2,i ordered a  and got a  so i was pretty pissed fast shipping but the go pro was missing a lot of stuff like plug cover and charger pretty crappy overallworst ever
7591,1,the lights actually hold no charge whatsoever they only operate it once theyre connected to a power source via usb this is not good i was expecting that the lights can be charged up and once they will fully charged up they can be used inside or outside and when they were to be low in power then you can continue on by connecting a usb power source to themagain the lights do not hold any power whatsoever they only operate with a power source being connected to the usb portthis was a wasted orderno charge in the lights
1951,1,bought this with high hopes for a fair quality camera at a lower price to film some lessons once a week i wasnt expecting high quality but i didnt expect such low quality either the video and audio were terrible the video was very distorted jumpy and would even pause itself when zooming in or out the audio sounded awful and when plugging in an external mic it sounded even worse you get what you pay for i ended up returning this camera and invested in one with better qualityvery disappointing
9262,1,thought this camera was good wrong not good waste of money  the connection to the battery gets loose and does not make contact with the battery and it dies should have bought a main line company camera really unhappyjunk
1484,1,i returned it the screen was cloudy and snowyit was returned with amazon shipping label on the  of october  it was returned with amazon shipping label on the  of october 
7116,2,when looking for an album i knew i didnt want to over pay i wanted something inexpensive so when i saw the good reviews i decided to try it outi paid  for the item when realistically i feel it should have been  think walmart brand flimsy plastic folderfor  more i was able to buy the  pocket photo album sold by ruibytreedirect and i am absolutely in love totally worth the extra  it comes with a side zipper and bookmark so your images will always be kept protected its very study i highly recommend you go check that one out instead flimsy
8334,2,camera was very slow and the buttons arent easy to navigate definitely not a camera for someone who just wants to snap and goslow
2847,1,camera did not work and i am very annoyed because i can not return itcamera did not work
1445,1,the camera was not user friendly to use the pictures were poor quality and hard to download from the camera i will never buy this brand againquality
1934,1,it does not function since i have bought it i dont know whats the problemi opened the box and then put the film in the light in the front is flashing but the flash is not working and its not taking any pictures i bought it as a surprise for my spouse but unfortunately it didnt turn out to be a good gifti missed the return period one film was opened but all other parts are unopened and still in their original packaging im requesting a refund or a replacement to be sent can you please assist meit does not function since i have bought it
3658,1,i loved this camera so much for the two events we used it for and then just like that it stopped working new batteries did not help nor did new film so disappointedstopped working after two uses
4865,1,was trying to take pictures of jewelrythey did not turn out at allwasnt a good choice for what i neededits good for taking pictures of your friends or selfies
3535,2,bought this on october of  now eight months later took to a cancun trip and the firts time ever dipped in water the front screen leaked water inside the camera called the gorpro customer sevice rep and said they only cover water damage for  days the camera is great at video but their warranty is garbage i would understand if the water leaked through the battery door but it leaked throught the front display that to me is a defective product will not be buying gopro ever again if you do buy make sure you submerge your camera well just to make sure it doesnt have the same defect mine did but not notice until it was too latehorrible warranty
4900,1,camera is not for underwater photography it focusses very poorly and so slow that movement defeats it and pictures are blurred unless in infinity the stabilization is very poor video comes out very jumpy waterproof locking system is fiddly and ultimately the camera flooded apparently because it is not clear when it is locked and by both tiny latches that need finger nails to move and are difficult to see if closed or open if you need glasses do not buy this camera the zoom is useless because of the focus problem  ie too slow and pics are blurred similarly closeup is not possiblethe flash may be useful in crystal clear water did not get to that but otherwise all you see are bright dots on a blurred backgroundnot for underwater use
8598,1,definitely not  or at least it seems that wayill give it a second chance
3468,1,this was a gift for my daughters  birthday she has had very little experience taking pictures with a camera but she was able to easily take pictures the problem is that the coloring is way off and the subject of the photo was always cut off i chalked it up to user error thinking she is still learning to use a camera after repeatedly having the same outcome with every picture i decided to try it myself and took a picture of her and made sure i had her centered in the image box on the camera the picture came out and she was partly cut off again i thought maybe i just moved a little so i decided to take a picture of a lego set and had the camera sitting on the table so it couldnt move at all the picture came out and again the it was cut off and the coloring is way off what a piece of junki added pictures to show how its cutting it off and the coloring the first picture is a picture of what i took the picture of the second picture i had taken my iphone and taken a picture through the lens of the kodak camera to show that the area with the frame around it is exactly around the lego set and yet its still cut off dont buy this camera unless you want a worthless camera that cuts off your subjects and turns the colors way offour older daughter has an instax and we should have just gone with the same one for our younger daughter so disappointedterrible
4096,1,i already have arlo indoor cameras that connect to my existing network router that work great i was anxious to add these outdoor cameras to the mix as we were already running the arlo desktop and mobile client to control the existing cameras the major downfall on the indooroutdoor kit is that the cameras will only connect to the arlo hubbase station plug the hub into the router and that connection worked great and became visible in the arlo app as available and connected however when it came time to pair the wireless cameras to the hub they would not connect literally  hours of phone time with arlo customer service talking with a representative reading off her script with zero technical understanding of the product among the many troubleshooting steps was to disconnect the ethernet cable from the hub and try a simple sync between the arlo hub and arlo cameras again both cameras fail to connect and sync the rep then proceeds to tell me the problem is with my isp and that i should contact them to correct my port settings think that through which she could not no matter how hard i explained it failure of the arlo cameras to connect to the arlo hub with no ethernet connected to the hub is a problem with the isp i dont fault a first line tech for not having a good grasp of technology but i do fault a company for not training a first line tech on when they are in over their head and should pass a customer on to a more skilled person three hours of my day wastedi finally did get transferred to a level ii tech val who was very knowledgable and very helpful to cut to the chase the arlo cameras connect to the arlo hub using a standard  ghz wifi channel the huge problem is that the channel used is not user selectable if you are in an environment that is high in wifi traffic such as an apartment complex office complex warehouse complex etc then the cameras and the hub are unable successfully make a stable connection fight with it hard enough and you can get intermittent connections but it is not sustainable or useablefrom my perspective the inability for an experienced user to manage the channel used between the hub  cameras or better yet just connect the cameras to one of your already existing wireless access points is a major design flaw a bit eyeopening that my previous experience with the arlo indoor cameras was great causing me to recommend the product and want to buy more arlo gear has not taken a  turn this one experience with questionable design choice as horrendous customer service skills causes me to recommend that anyone seeking wireless security cameras should most certainly look elsewherefails in a wifi rich environment
7327,2,this item was shipped to me without a battery i have no idea what functionalities it has because it doesnt work so dissappointingdwgopro shipped without the included battery
11042,5,this is a game changer for me i always made my rice in a small pan on the stove had to watch over it and always would either not cook or burn just measure your rice and add water turn on and it cooks and turns to warm when done easy peasy love it awesome rice cooker
12839,5,works great and as expected love that is has the full door attached last one i used had a plastic door that just slid off feels sturdy like it will last a long time not to heavy though so easily stored on a shelf when not in use dried first batch of pears well and evenly dried jam almost too well that it broke into shards so make sure and dont over dry as this can do itworks great
8157,2, i really like the camera i really really like it problem is the app really really sucks the app crashed multiple times actually lost several videos due to app crashing this is absolutely unacceptable since part of the reason you want a video of your ride is for protection in case of a collision as well as documenting the fun of the ridei messaged customer support through the app and via email and got no reply in over  days so besides the app being poorly designed and not frequently updated there is little to no tech support apparentlyi returned the camera within the return windowgood camera poor app
6796,2,this product requires you to buy your own sd card small sticker on camera says class  or better manual that doesnt come with it have to google says no greater than  card those limitations should be included in description on amazon could have saved  trips to store and one order on azpandoras box
894,2,this is a toy do not buy as a hobby camera very poor quality you can pay twice the price and get  times the quality there simply is no way to charge the mic battery poor video quality save your money and buy a good camera at least a  not buy for serious projects
9470,5,"in a pot on the stove top the ratio is two cups of water to one cup of rice perfect in this cooler for my son its marked ha haits less then two cups of water to one cup of rice in the steamer still makes some yummy perfect ricebought this for my son"
5404,2,perfect size could not see subject very well you get what you pay forcamera
4765,1,i ordered the two set pack that was on sale but only received one lightthis is very disappointing because ive to go thru another tedious process of returning then re orderingi didnt receive my complete order
4207,1,there are minimal buttons and after following directions i cant get my camera to workcant get it to work
2282,1,terrible broke after one day of use such a waste of money returning asapdo not purchase
751,1,image quality on this camera looks nothing like  theres hardly any features on it that actually work like they are supposed to the images are super poor quality even when you are not using the  zoom thats not even that great my cell phone takes better quality photos returning this camera and spending money on a higher end one this camera is extremely cheap plasticyou get what you pay for
6112,1,sent this back for replacement was double charged and still do not have a working cameradoes not work
7161,2,id like to preface this by saying that i was honestly really excited for this product and the thought that i wouldnt have to carry around my neck strap for quick shooting the neck strap i have is amazing but it can get a little unwieldy or in my way if im trying to snag quick shots so i purchased this wrist strap insteadfirst impressions of it were really solid the overall craftsmanship and installation easily  stars it didnt feel flimsy or anything and by mounting it to the camera while tying the other end to the strap mounts it felt really sturdy once i had adjusted everything to fit my handwristthat said im giving it  stars because upon my first actual testuse of it i let the camera go gently i didnt just drop it from my hands to help my mom carry something and it was fine  for all of two seconds one of the rivet buttons snapped open and it allowed the strap to slide clean off of my hand which in turn allowed my camera to fall and hit the ground solid rock since i was on a mountain hardi wish that there was a sort of mechanism to lock those rivets or at least prevent them from popping open on their own the quick access is nice but not if it sacrifices my camera or lens  thankfully my lens only sustained some scratches to the outside no cracks but my camera body sustained some internal damage esp to the mirror so i had to get that fixedit showed promise this strap but i cant trust it with my camera since then ive switched back to my neck strap and havent had any further issuesgood material quality rivet opened
5232,1,this is not toddler proof it broke after a weeknot toddler proof
3583,1,i just opened the gopro supposedly brand new no battery door on the camera as well as no battery where did quality control gowas received with no battery or battery door
17353,5,"note  i am not a paid representative though i may sound like one im just a foodie that has spent a lot of time in japan for business and over time came to really appreciate rice sounds simple  rice is a staple in probably close to half the world though not so much here in the us it is a staple for me  i cook rice probably a couple times a week ive had a zojirushi for years  my go to rice cooker when i heard about the new induction rice cookers i wanted to give them a try i went with zojirushi because the brand has served me very wellim not disappointed indeed i cant say enough about this cooker have just finished my third batch i just bought it have made sushi rice basmati and tonight jasmine the difference between induction and noninduction is subtle but distinct to my palette though im not sure if i could articulate howzojirushi is clearly into rice by way of example the jasmine setting is new my old cooker didnt have it now traditionally you thoroughly wash jasmine rice and then let if soak in the liquid for a while before cooking it after a call with their customer support they told me i didnt have to worry about that jasmine is programmed to cook jasmine put the rice in put the liquid in and as far as i can tell it seemed to allow for the soaking time with slight warming prior to doing the full cook all i know is that i got perfect fragrant rice every kernel fully cooked but distinct incredibly fluffyyes  it is a bit expensive  perhaps not worth it if you use a rice cooker once or twice a year but this is one of the workhorses on my kitchen that will be used weekly for years and from what i can tell from the first few uses i find it overwhelmingly worth the priceperfect"
14838,4,great product tried it the first time today we are a family that eats rice for every meal and it cooked my rice perfectly and with less water the product is just like it says  cups of uncooked rice it holds but i think is too much i cooked  cups and the rice for so big it lifted the lid up also it comes with a scoop that says  cup but i compared it to all my measuring cups that i had and a new one i ordered along side with this and the product cup comes out to half a cupperfect rice
7418,1,pictures are very dark unless i front of led lights pictures are also very blurry unless its close like a selfiedont waste your money like i did
9079,1,i will be ordering directly from polaroids website next time all film i received was expiredexpired film buyer beware
914,2,this is a camera for kids to play with not to take videos that you want to keep as in wedding videos and the microphone sucksthis is a camera more for kids
12239,5,"i was a bit weary to spend so much on a rice cooker as i had recently had a nice tiger rice cooker straight from korea that i had used for over  years but i thought i would change it up a bit and when i recently moved left it behind well i never ever knew what i was missing i had had  years of eating mediocre rice thats not to say that i was purchasing bad rice i was actually purchasing nice organic rice  brown wild basmati you name it i was getting the good stuff it all pretty much came out the same i didnt mind the consistency but my husband didnt take to it too well anyways i had read up on this zojirushi and even made this purchase by not consulting my husband but just telling him that instead i bought it and had read on the reviews here that it cooks rice perfectly but does take a bit long so i opted for this more expensive model because it also had the timer feature  i mean who wouldnt want to set the time for something to be ready and have it be ready by then i doas a stay at home mom being busy with a very mobile toddler i dont have the time to sit and watch rice cook on the stove and i love having a rice cooker plus it is great to get fresh rice or beans in the morning so that i can make lunches or even for breakfast time the reviews on amazon about rice being cooked perfectly are completely true i have never had such perfectly cooked rice at home so delicious and it makes the money i spend on quality organic rice products and beans so worth itonly tips i can give to you would be these two things if you are using the timer  remember that it uses  hour timing so if you set it for  then that is  and  for   you will only make that mistake once make sure that the removable inner lid is attached to the top of the underside of the external lid before closing otherwise well cooking the rice cooker will open i am presuming due to steam build up or something or pressure and the rice will not be as well cooked as it should be  or turn out more dry than moistthis is a great buy i have used it for brown wild and white rice i also cook beans in it on a consistent basis kidney chickpeas lentils black beans and even quinoa this has got to be one of my favorite small appliances in my kitchen and my husband thinks the price was totally worth it and he is now a rice loverwow i absolutely love this machine  not just for rice"
3978,2,the pictures are terrible i wish i bought my daughter a different onepictures are too dark on all settings
6393,2,the sd slot is oversized so when i pushed my card in it missed the sd port and slid inside the camera and is lost forever didnt even get to try it once and now i cant use the camera not sure what i expected for  ate my sd card
3131,1,all the films i received are close to expiring while these films are supposed to be used within  months of productiongot almost expired films
1689,1,its kind of impossible to use you have to get the battery hatch open but you cant so its been just sitting since christmas waste of money also the sd card slot first of all it doesnt come with an sd card second of all theres already sometime if place holder in there and i cant get it out i reached out the company december  and still no response im definitely returning it this weekdo not buy
218,1,didnt come witht he battery battery charger or leans like it said it would 
8448,1,we bought these cameras and the film for our vacation only  in  of the film pages would actually work on either of the two different cameras we purchased this is a horrible product such a disappointmentdo not waste your money
8177,1,good battery lifeno image stabilizationimpossible to capture license plates while moving even at close distance and good lights only if when stopped licence plate can be read useless for documenting traffic events except to have general ideain dashcam mouse maximum clip lengths are  minutes there is small but noticeable action gap between clips and there is good chance important details will be lost in that gapaffordable but not useful as dashcam
2715,2,this little camera seemed to work fine immediately after the kids started using it but since they are kids they eventually lost interest for a few months and the camera lost its charge during that time shouldnt be a problem but when they wanted to use it again and we tried to charge it the battery would no longer hold a charge so now we have an overpriced toy camera that can only be used to take pretend pictures well definitely be looking for a different option when we decide to purchase another kidfriendly camerastopped charging after a few months
8533,2,i cant give an honest answer on anything because ive been sent the wrong adapter so i cant charge my battery to even take my first picture  so upset and of course everyone needs their weekend break ugh
387,2,the camera quality is poor i would much rather use my phone i guess it would be a good camera for my  year old but even she said she prefer the phone camera its cute light weight small enough to fit in a purse just didnt like the videophoto qualitywasnt a good fit for me
3478,2,the camera itself is made of cheap flimsy parts i havent had it for that long and have only gotten about  pictures out of it the spring that help the back stay on broke off at some point and after i tried to put them back on the back of the camera wont close properly thus when i try to take a picture the camera only beeps at me and turns off im kinda sad about these results i dont think its worth the moneypoor plastic qualitydecent picture quality
6507,2, star for the usb power cable  stars for the unit the usb power cable is maybe  inches long and it did not come with the  wall charger for this price i would have liked to have had the wall chargerno wall charger

8546,2,i bought this from all about office seller and it came with a european plug for the battery charger can be charged with a simple adapter voltage doesnt matter in this case however you might want to check with the seller before buying and make sure the model you buy has the right plug for your countrybe aware of correct charger plug for your country
4197,1,i was super excited to get this product and use it for my daughters bridal shower the item came new in the package but the camera after batteries were installed would not advance the film i tried a second film cartridge and had the same result back to polaroid i gofujifilm instax mini  instant camera  disappointed
5864,1,this camera broke in less than a month i was in alaska and so disappointed that i could not take picturesless than  days
4571,2,my husband and i are left scratching our heads about the reviews that say this camera is easy to use we each tried to figure out how to use this camera so that we could show our daughter how to use it and neither of us had any success the several buttons on the front are next to impossible to read  they each have raised symbols on them but not all of the symbols are intuitive and you can barely read them to begin with how is a small child supposed to figure this out if you have the patience of a saint i wish you lucky as the concept is greatwhat am i missing
11220,5,because i am always serving undercooked rice i had started using minute rice to be safe my husband recently got news that his cholesterol is high so i needed to change his diet i learned that rice is better for him than potatoes so i took a chance and got this little guy after just the first batch i was amazed at the difference between minute rice and pure uncooked rice it is so easy as well just add the rice and water push a couple of buttons and when the rest of the meal is ready the rice is ready as well love the keep warm option as well so small and cute it goes well in my kitchensuper little rice maker
8421,1,so great product and all maybe if you keep in a photo album but i put magnets on the back of these and every single one of them has warped in away for no reason just sad keep in photo album to solve problems amazing but
1506,2,this is basically a dollar store quality camera which is to be expected i guess for the price of it i would waste your money on this 
5867,1,poor no memory stick and no casedissapointing
5050,1,the picture quality was very poor and a big disappointmentavoid buying
2169,1,the lights are uneven causing shadows and a halo around the items in the picturesthe whole point of the backdrop is to create an infinity illusion but the giant crease looks like a horizon there are only two lights the one overhead and one off to the left i swear i started looking in the box to see if there was another light that i was missingnow look at the cover image that amazon provides and see what i got and tell me if amazons description is accurate the pictures that i can get with this dont meet amazons own photo standardsi have two choices either return it or spend more money this was   and maybe rig additional led lights to it but what if that doesnt workcome on amazon youre better than this doesnt meet amazons own image requirements

457,1,poor auto focus capabilitya powershot  beats this hands down on getting a picture in focus
8152,1,what happened i expected technology advancement to wow me prelude i bought a drift hd  over ten years ago and used it for extreme desert and monsoon dirt bike outings it produced awesome videos for its era and i never lost it due to its low profile my friends with go pros lost that big box on their helmet time and time again present tense i thought it was time for an upgrade with this drift ghost xl very large disappointment video quality is worthless in my opinion i have tried multiple drift recommended micro sd cards and all settings only to come home and become upset that the awesome day of riding was recorded but the resolution absolutely sucked  delete and only stored in my mind i have a decade of vids using the old original drift hd  without complaints so i feel i have a valid voice this drift ghost xl will be ghosted by me as of now since a return isnt an option because i spent too many months determining that it isnt capable or out performing or even replicating a decade old drift camera i doubt i will ever but a drift action camera again and certainly do not recommend to friend or foe everyone should drift away from considering this action losing cameramuch poorer video quality than my abused drift   over  years old
2445,1,it is not as good quality as i hoped for nit worth it do not buy thisdisappointing
4698,1,i got this today and i put a sd card in with pictures on it and my amazon fire tablet and my tv to not recognize that any photos are on itdoes not recognize photos from sd card
6111,2,didnt come with any batteriesno batteries
7331,2,i am having problems with the quality of videonow we can not get it to turn oni really need some helpgopro  silver
6651,1,the camera did not work from beginning the sd is in but the camera could not detect it and then error message appears said the card is full the instruction manual with very minimal instruction offer no help to troubleshooting the issue not recommended for anyonenot working from the start
8317,1,the screen is broke and we cannot take picturesthe screen is broke
7500,2,i think the only reason why this product gets high reviews is because they are offering free gift if you leave them a  review  which is against amazon tosin reality this camera records videos in similar quality as my cheap dash cam it appears grainy stretched and absolutely terrible if shot during the night i seriously had to resort to using my  year old google pixel phone to take videos still photos are terrible as well i think the realistic resolution of the camera sensor is less than  megapixels meaning the image is then stretched to resolution is advertised on the  video is only  and image stabilization is not available if shooting in  camera heats up and sometimes freezes up and video becomes choppy i had to shoot everything in either  or  stabilization is only available in  modethe good image stabilization works it is not a professional level stabilization but at this price  it works ok although only in  mode mounting clip broke within the first  seconds of unboxing the camera quick email to seller and they had mailed a brand new clip  big props for quick service  thanksif youre looking for a disposable  action camera thats cheap enough to lose or break  this is a good product if youre looking for a  action camera  invest a bit more money and get a major brand camera or upgraded version from this vendor i wish i could say this camera takes a decent quality video for the price but i simply   lol dash cam video quality my  year old phone took better videos and photos
6728,1,i was hesitant to buy this because the straps looked so uncomfortable and cheaply made like other reviews say this gets uncomfortable to wear within  minutes their straps have absolutely no padding or ventilation and same goes with the back area of the bagso uncomfortable
1404,1,this camera is not what was shown on the picture and i im not happy about it im going return it and get my money backthis camera is not what was shown in the pictures
8433,1,we bought these for guests to use our wedding for the guestbook and they were terrible we ended up returning the camera that uses these as we know well never use this film again most of the pictures turn out either blurry or grainy they are really difficult to use most of the guests had to have help figuring out how to do them i wish i could return these but that option is not being offered to me now i would not recommendwould not buy again
267,1,so disappointed that i purchased the lumix  at the last minute for a once in a lifetime trip to the galapagos islands only to find out the battery would not charge the camera is for now useless since i am living overseas i hope to update this review pending warranty andor vendor responsethanks to amazon cs for assisting with a full refund i will mention that panasonic cswarranty department was not very efficient nor timely and i felt like i was getting the run around thank you amazon customer servicebattery will not charge im at a lose 
862,1,ive brought this camera on multiple trips to take a polaroid picture to help capture a memory and it has failed me each time very disappointingrandomly stops working
2508,1,pictures often dont develop at all big waste of moneytotally does not work
7743,1,this camera is definitely not worth the price unless youre looking for a functioning toy camera for a preschooler had it been for a  year old or younger this would have been an okay purchase however the screen resolution on the device poor and the pictures look exactly the same on the computer incredibly grainy total waste of moneycheap
8065,1,used my camera twice before it started malfunctioning and now it no longer works at allfaulty product
1927,1,horrible picture qualityevery picture i took was blurry and looked like it was over exposedhorrible picture
3799,2,the photos are very grainy and low qualitylow quality
1238,1,i was suppose to get  boxes of film i only got twomissing items
3612,1,the listing and photo are for purple i have ordered it twice and received pink both times frustrating for me but maybe perfect for you if you want pinkarrived twice in pink
8785,1,finally was able to use the product at the event intended and was sadly disappointed quality of the photos were horrible and the camera itself dies after  photos wish i could return it at this point and buy something with better qualityno what i expected
8959,1,camera never worked properlycamera never worked properly
4882,1,i dont like this product the pictures are to darkno
2543,1,my daughter absolutely loved this camera that she got for her birthday fast forward a month she had ran out of paper so we order her more tried using the camera again and it no longer works it will turn on take a picture but will not print out i thought maybe it needed ink as well so looked into it but its an ink less printer my daughter is absolutely sad she wanted to take it to school on the last day to take pictures with her friends and couldnt dont waste your moneydont waste your money
14868,5, its so easy to make rice now i had to get a shower so i put the rice on and it was done by the time i got out just follow instructions on the bag of rice and youre good to go so yummy perfect rice and you cant beat under  bucks for iti love making rice its so easy now
3373,1,i wasnt looking for a great camera at this price but it isnt even worth the moneyabout as bad as expected
7,4,slightly slower charging than the plug in typeconvenient
3041,1,gave this as a birthday gift to my daughter she loved it worked great and within a week it would not hold a charge  im afraid she is losing interest now because of this disappointing fact wish it would have lasted longer than a week i have tried to charge both batteries with no successwas great until it wasnt
389,2,so it was broken when i got it and so i returned it like any other person would do in been a month and i have not go my money back i personally would recommendwont give money back its been over a month
13412,5,i hate making rice on the stovetop it never seems to come out exactly right i got this at christmas time and it has become of my favorite kitchen tools its simple to use rice comes out perfect every time  its easy to clean what more could you ask fornice little rice cooker
14882,5,it did a good job rice was deliciousrice cooker
4759,1,left it to charge because it takes forever to charge and the battery doesnt even last  it burnt out  maybe mine was a default but it sucks because it was a nice light it burnt out
8758,1,the camera is faulty and it doesnt matter how good of lighting you have the photos come out dark and unclear highly disappointed in this faulty camerado not buy this
2463,1,i bought this camera because it had everything i wanted video macro capabilities and low price the downside was that i couldnt reliably download my photosvideos to my pc to work on them i think the issue is as stupid as a bad usb input jack on the camera itself i sent several hours getting intermittent transfers from the camera to my pc but that eventually came to a stand still so i threw in the towel and sent it back based on youtube reviews this camera has lots of problems so i kinda wish i had done my homework before the purchasewhen it works its great
6694,1,doesnt work bought for daughters birthday and cant use it 
5850,2,overall a good camera but the only bad thing about it is that wifi didnt work it wouldnt connect to any deviceoverall a good camera but the only bad thing about it is 
10456,4,i got this to replace the previous one of the same brand and size i had it works fine i just need it to cook rice but the new design of it automatically has it always on warm feature when you dont switch it to cook with the old design it would simply be off unless you switched it to cook and the older unit would automatically turn off after it finished cooking i wish there was a separate switch on the new unit to fully turn it off without having to unplug the unit otherwise the unit could be left on forever which would be dangerousgood but could potentially cause fires with new design
6377,2, is  but the ighest resolution this camera can capture is actually  the image quality is also quite poor i tried it as a frontfacing bicycle camera but it is not possible to read license plates in the video the included accessories are good but i dont think i can use the camera for anythingnot 
8339,1,nothing is in focus everything is very blurryterrible camera
8444,1,bad picture qualitytakes terrible photos
14877,5,wanted a rice cooker to do small batches this does the job very wellgood
14812,4,as far as rice cookers go this does the job well the only issue i have with it is the fact that theres isnt a holder on the side for the rice scooper so its just sitting on the side or in the cabinet which isnt convenienta really solid rice cooker
6479,1,i never review anything when i first get it its like a new girlfriend everything is wonderful generally until the new wears off well just like that it worked great when i first got it did everything it claimed it would do it just wouldnt do it very long  battery life was ok not great and the color temp adjustment worked put picked it up to use it one day and nothing battery was charged but figured id charge it again just in case charged it for hours and still nothing charged it overnight and nothing oh the charging lights worked said it was charged and charging but the light itself failed to come on probably since its led it was a problem with the controller board id think so ill be taking it apart as im sure its out of warranty and just try to get a chinese company to honor one now anyway or any company for that matter maybe i can fix otherwise i have a  paper weight and one more item i can add to the list of ripped off dont by againcheap chinese junk failed in about a year
8085,1,maybe mine is defective one photo out of  okout of focus or over exposed  of the time
2246,1,this camera  is a complete mess  my daughters toy camera has better quality please add money and buy something alot betterhorrible quality get what you pay for
691,2,i kept hearing this is great for beginners and it wont break your pockets true but the video quality and sound quality isnt worth the dollars you maybe saving id rather skip a few uber eats than cheat the quality of my videos and photos but if you want a camera to just have its cool but anything professional i wouldnt recommendits a no for me
3336,2,difficult to usevery complicated
3822,2,camera was great value but only worked for about two months now i cant even turn it ongood camera but it didnt last
614,1,i saw that it goes up to a high megapixel for the price i thought it would be a great little camera i was wrong even when formatted to a higher megapixel the picture quality was that of a lower pixel camera if giving to a child it would be ok but if you are looking for high quality pics you wont get them with this camerapictures not up to the clarity it should be
4838,1,does not work properly will not take pictures and the exposure level buttons wont stop blinking also we only received two boxes of film not  which is what we paid for ill be sending this back but its so disappointing because it was a christmas gift for our daughterdoes not work
1490,1,box came broken screen wont show picturedont buy
2509,1,camera does not work and needs to be sent backcamera doesnt work
13377,5,very easy to use and cleani recommend this product very nice rice cooker
3801,1,my  old daughter bought this for herself with all of her leftover christmas money she was super excited to get it it is a cute camera but it doesnt work all that great the quality of the pictures sucks it is pretty blurry unfortunately the camer freezes up alot we have to take the battery out  wait approximately  mins before putting the battery back in  restarting it my daughter is severely disappointed in these factors  i would have yo agree with her that its a waste of money ifk if we just got a bad one of the bunch but when the day ends in child tears its never a good signcrap shoot
4801,2,got this as a christmas gift have only used two packs of film and the camera is already broke i have tried new batteries and the lights will not stop flashing on the front have done everything it says not sure after  pictures how something can stop workingjunk used  pls film broken
10498,5,i was so excited to get something that would make individual servings you can even grill onions and cook carrots in it my only complaint is that it comes with the admonition to only use the measuring cup sent with it which is scored differently from a real measuring cup yet the recipe book that came with it gives directions for using a real measuring cup someone goofed there it cooks quickly this thing gets hot my biggest problem is that this pot sits on only three legs so it tips over easily i put the cooker in the sink while it cooks so no one like my cat accidentally knocks it over this one makes only  servings which is perfect for a single person or someone living in a dorm or an rv cleanup is very simplevery convenient
6817,2,as stated on amazon that this camera was wifi capable it is not cheap construction manual contols on back of camera do not match the icons on the screen poor in structions on usepoor quality item
210,1,simply stopped working after only  uses never dropped or got wet nothing happens when the shutter button is pressed expensive disappointmentstopped working
6982,1,i bought one of these for my step daughter last year and she loves it i just ordered one for myself and it was delivered today and it wont turn on ive tried  different kinds of batteries tried cleaning the battery area tried everything and it wont turn on and its supposed to be brand new ill be returning and purchasing a different style polaroid from another retailer since this keeps occurring with products i buy on herebrand new and wont turn on
13191,2,this rice cooker is affordable easy to use easy to clean and makes nice rice but if you make rice in the morning or at lunch for multiple meals throughout the day this is not the cooker you want to buy the keep warm setting is too hot and dries out the rice into a yellow crust after a few hours you will be lucky to get rice out of it for dinner if you cook the rice at lunch time do not even think about trying to use this rice cooker to keep rice overnight it will dry completely outif you keep rice for more than one meal this cooker is not for you
272,1,plain and simplehad the camera for just  days dropped it oncething broke a baby dropnothing even crazy and now its costing me  to fixmore than half the value of the camera unreal please avoid its inexcusable that this camera could not withstand this tiny drop from about  ft high onto a rug the shutterlens got knocked loose and theres sustainable internal damageim sorryobviously know cameras arent meant to be dropped but its a crying shame that a harmless little user blip couldnt be withstood im so angry i wasted my money on this and now have to sink more into it unrealso annoyed i bought this camera  please avoid
9455,5,"this is the third rise cooker i got during last week the first one was low quality and i returned that the second one was toshiba brand this is a famous high quality cooker but the biggest size is  cups that is too small for me so i returned that too finally i ordered this one i havent used it yet but i guess it will be great since i have been used rice cookers for  years i can say it looks easy to use i got the size of  cups that is perfect for me the design is awesome and its good quality  i used it for brown rice and short white rice the result was greatperfect rice cooker"
8931,1,bought the red one because its my wifes favorite color the camera we got was not red not even close it was more of a brown or bronze color never even checked out the camera itself going back because of the color im sure the camera is fine im hoping they have one in red i want it it was an early christmas giftwrong color
6471,1,i bought this after i read all the positive reviews and compared it with numerous similar items i also had to buy separtely a table tripod for this i did all the right things and excitedly started to use it for the first time within  to  minutes of my video meeting it started blinking then went dead it was shocking and embarrasing enough i turned if off and after a short while pressed the on button again and the light did go back on but within  minutes it blinked again and went back dead i discontinued using it for the rest of my meeting a major disappointment not only for the money the ensemble is not cheap to me considering the tripod that i needed to buy and research time i spent but this rendered me with no led light for my next immient video meeting i know other people have better luck  but why meblinked and stopped during first use have to return
3885,2,camera it self is flawless if u need it for video i would say stay away auto focus is horroble 
6058,1,broke  time in the water sad little girl herebroke
4891,2,this camera for christmas for our trip to the bahamas in two months it stopped working it would no longer power up contacted kodak and they were supposed to send me a replacement battery they have not to date it has been almost  months and no communication from kodak againnice pics till it stopped working
5345,2,very disappointed in this bought for my sons  birthday he loves pictures so we thought it was perfect well it kept killing the batteries picture quality is very very bad took us forever to figure out how to even view the photos we have already replaced it not worth the price it should just be a toyhorrible
10504,5,this rice cooker is amazing works perfectlyno issueslove it
13213,5,this rice cooker is great the flowers are very pretty and the rice cooker comes with a steaming tray the rice comes out perfect and not mushy not raw if the rice cooker came with a coverlid for leftover rice to store in the refrigerator that would be a helpful item to include great rice cooker
11086,5,took me a min to figure it out but i really love this quick easy and cleanup is a snap you can cook rice on the bottom and steam veggies on top a real time saverthis product is great
5210,2,the quality of the picture when uploaded to a computer is very poor which was sad since my little boy took some really good pics for his agequality not as well as expected
2725,1,this camera is trash i have no idea how it is even available for sale the images taken are horrible and i would return it in a heartbeat if the company i purchased it from on amazon procam accepted returns i posted the best picture that i could take with this camera and thats after running through the adjustments i had to make i will give this camera to my eight year old nephew to play with because there is nothing i can do with itutter garbage
7874,2,i was really excited to get a small photo printer i compared a few different options but settled on this one unfortunately all of my photos turn out orange ive tried recommended fixes and it hasnt improved i wouldnt recommend this printerthe colors are off
6484,2,this light worked fine for about a week now it wont hold a charge and just shuts off after a minute  i have it plugged in  of the time so theres no reason it should die so quickly also it could not handle  backtoback hourlong video calls in row my fault for not seeing that it doesnt charge while its on the usb cable that comes with it is super short youll have to find another if you plan on mounting it and leaving it therewouldnt hold a charge after a week of light use
5580,1,or doesnt take a picture i got it to work twice once was to push the film cover out and the other was black and didnt develop it just blinks and never is ready to take the picture im really upset because i bought alot of filmdoesnt work
10457,4,"this is my first rice cooker and i decided to go with the dash mini because i like the idea of small batches for rice whether its white basmati organic brown jasmine or plain old long grain white it works like a charm a single cycle takes about  minutes give or take and the rice comes out perfectincluded with the user guide is a small number of recipes intended specifically for their mini rice cooker although ive only tried a few and theyre tasty the cooker itself isnt big enough to hold and cook the dishes specifically messy was the thai red curry chicken and we omitted the onion making it less volume overall than the recipe as written these recipes fill the pot of the cooker all the way up to the top of the fill mark which is where the lid sits once the contents really get cooking the simmering and boiling cause the lid to move around and the liquid spurts up through the vent hole and around the edges i learned to put a good pad of paper towel underneath just in casei landed on  out of  stars because it does work wonderfully for cooking rice its a great price and its adorable i would recommend this product for someone who wants a small batch rice cooker but isnt necessarily interested in using it to cook anything elsesuper for rice only ok for the recipes included"
8030,1,the one that i got did not work i followed the instructions and everything and it did not take any of the photos to print out i replaced the film and that did not work i did everything and nothing made it work it was just the one i got did not work the product itself is amazing they just decide to give me a crampy onethe one i got did not work
8083,1,awful dont waste your moneypolaroid camera
494,2,great for video but hard to stabilize for stills even with a tripodlook for the viewfinder
6783,1,the camra lens no click in plase  it took hour to make focus this you never  stinky  charger allways say batery ful i had it to go and it melttterrible
1005,2,the camera is definitely meant as a fun toy for kids and my little brother loves using it and takes it everywherethe quality is not very good
4873,1,wrong order not  filmswrong set helga
13395,1,it didnt last three months it start leaking when you cook rice i wouldnt not recommend this product also since the lead is attached with the cooker you can not clean them and it makes bad smell once you start using on a daily basisbad product
2991,1,this was very disappointing wouldnt purchase againlousy picture quality and color
8673,1,we bought this for our son to take to science camp so he wouldnt be tempted to take his phone to the watery and muddy bits of the trip we also figured if it got lost altogether it was cheaper then a new phone unfortunately this thing eats batteries so quickly that he was only able to take a few photos and zero video the pics he did take were grainy and small its also hard to work with poorly labeled buttons and features a disposable waterproof film camera would have been a better choicedid not meet our expectations
551,1,i was looking to replace my canon  which after years of heavy use ive loved i bought the kodak  because it offered manual functions which sadly are no longer offered with most smaller cameras i must say i was positively stunned flabbergasted actually at the horrible photo quality good god atrociouswow  amaaazingly bad
10496,4,this mini rice cooker is just the right size for the two of us the quality is great and the coating is the same good quality as our blue diamond nonstick pans we only received a spoon and cup im upset because the booklet was not enclosed so were doing a lot of guessingdidnt receive the small booklet
4486,1,left my lens dirtier than it was before lint from the microfiber cloth everywhere streaks everywhere waste of moneywaste of money
14765,5,for the most part i have made basic white rice and sushi rice i can make it first thing in the morning and it can stay on warm almost all day one day i made velveeta cheese and rotele next timestewlove it
7075,2,cant get it to stop printing with margins otherwise like this cam a lotprints with margins
17584,5,title sums it up this is my third rice cooker first two were from local stores after a few uses or first use rice would stick to the bottom or burn on the bottom so i decided to try this rice cooker not regretting this purchase rice comes out perfect every time love this thingbest rice cooker ive owned
2552,1,out of the package it did not power on so i charged it for an hour and still no signs of life highly disappointedit doesnt power on
5765,1,i have had this camera for more than a month now and i have not been satisfied yet i tried printing portraits nature shots all range of colors one could possibly imagine and i wasnt able to print one single photo that looked okay or decent not worth the price poor quality not true to any color ive used polaroids before and the prints that this printer produces is not polaroid quality at allbad quality inconsistent
7415,1,remains on flash charging lamp indicator light does not turn off even in off position continues to take photos with the lens cover closed only way to turn it off to ensure there is not an accidental shot taken and conserve battery life is to remove the batteries completely also attempted to reset and still had the same issue saddens me greatly was so excited and heard great reviews prior to purchasingdefective does not turn off
14104,5,this rice cooker is great it doesnt take up too much space but is still an efficient cooker and looks great while doing the job it is also very quiet and the controls are easy to understand and usegreat rice cooker
5105,2,i want to start off by saying that i love that this camera has a flip out screen i love that feature in the photos provided by myself these would have been better if i took them on my phone i could get some clear pictures if i messed around with it for a good  minutes but even then they are not really that good this camera also doesnt have a good auto focus you cant manually focus on a person or flower the screen is not touch screen at all and you dont have a lot of optionssettings to work with i know this is not a super high tech one but for how much you are paying for i would not recommend this camera to anyone if you are trying to vlog this camera doesnt have a good microphone at all i would rather buy a camera that has a microphone that is clear enough to understand what you are saying this camera does have a port to plug in a different microphone why would you want to pay a good  for a camera that has bad videopicture quality and then go spend more money on a different microphone for thatpros  flip out screen  comes with a lens  port to have a different microphonecons  bad videopicture quality  bad microphone  horrible auto focus  no touch screenthis camera is okay kinda
6070,2,this camera does ok video quality but when it comes to photos it is not the best i need something i can take with me everywhere that is light and takes good pictures i thought that this will be the one camera since reviews look good but it wasnt every photo i took came out some what blurry even in manual settings i am a photographer that have been hauling a very heavy camera equipment my camera it self weight about  pounds and is big no joke nikon coolpix  amazing camera but unfortunely is too big to take everywhere and theres been times i been in places where i can not take it with me i visit many trails during summer and sometimes walks are long i was in car accident and carrying my camera in a back pack on my back now makes the camera feel like  pounds after walking for a little while if you are a photographer like me looking for good quality photos in a small camera inexpensive camera this camera is not itnot the best
14085,5,rice is perfect every timeworks perfect
7294,1,i actually got so mad at this product when i was trying to sync it up to my track day app and the fact you cannot preview what is on the screen when you have the camera in place that i smashed it against the floor and threw it over my back yard fence as far as i couldand that is the truthi actually got so mad at this product when i 
11131,4,this is perfect for a single person or a couple very easy to operate it cooks perfect rice and it steams veggies very well one thing i have to warn about is even though it says you can cook up to three cups it gets pretty full from two other than that no complains love the size and love the coloradorable
575,1,my daughter saved her money and brought this completely drains batteries very quickly even expensive ones and the picture is not clear att all disappointed 
789,1,i brought this for my daughter she charged it and soon as she took it off the camera shut off only works on charger flash doesnt work even for the price this is not worth itdoesnt work
4403,1,we had a small pixstar frame for a number of years and decided to upgrade to a  frame for the first  weeks it worked fine and then started to go to a flickering gray screen it started to happen more frequently i contacted pixstar and they said they would send out a replacement  which never arrived i sent a number of emails back to the person that sent the original response to my first email and again no response so it went back to amazon really disappointing customer service from pixstarreliability questioned and poor customer response
13918,4,"i got this to replace a larger old rice cooker that was too large for my current needs the toshiba rice cooker is ideal for a small household i can make a single serving up to three cups which i use when i make fried rice i havent tried the quick cook yet as i am very happy with the standard rice setting the rice is perfectly cooked i have used the timer to make both rice and oatmeal and it worked great for bothcleanup is a snap the bowl virtually wipes clean with none of the dried on rice the old rice cooker would haveif i have any complaints it would be with the instruction manual although it covers the basic functions well it is vague in dealing with things like using the timersgreat rice plus"
3767,2,fuzzy pictures and out of focus not worth it for  bucks i expected more not even as good as my iphone i dont know why i expected a little more quality but its just not worth it use your camera on your smart phone and i guarantee it will be better dont buy itfuzzy pictures and out of focus not worth it

5060,1,this is just  of the dozen or so that are complete garbage the ones that actually developed are mediocre at best returning immediately what a complete piece of garbagezero should be an option
7046,2,two stars purely for the novelty of an instant printercamera but seriously if you would like to keep believing that kodak makes quality products stay away from this onethe build quality is extraordinarily cheap the photo paper tray cover which also houses the touch screen is loose and keeps squeaking no matter how gently you try to hold the camera when the camera is turned on the retractable flash pops up and you are supposed to turn it off by closing the flash  but there is no tactile feedback or a click when you try to close it and most of the times the flash simply refuses to stay closed the touch screen is extremely poor quality plastic screen that bends with each touchpresshad it been just one of the flaws from the above list i would have believed that maybe i got a faulty device but the collection of issues suggests that the product is not necessarily well designed or paid detailed attention tothe software is just clunky and coupled with a poor touch screen it takes at least a couple of taps to get anything done before you get used to whats going on its also one of the slowest software i have used on a camera for example it took me five to six attempts to take a simple selfie you click the shutter button and hold the camera still at least three seconds before you flip it to see the picture any sooner and all you see on the screen is blurlastly the print quality seems equally poor i clicked and printed just one picture edited on the camera to add a white frame and it didnt even align well on the paper i didnt try printing the original picture the print was dull and colors seem faded however it could be that the camera is bad and not the printer maybe the print would be relatively better if you try printing pictures taken with your smartphone but then for that i would just buy an instant printer rather than a camera  printerthanks to amazon i was able to return it even though i had opened the pack of  zinc photo papers included with the productif you associate kodak the brand with quality dont buy this camera
7066,1,awful camera terrible quality prints its not clear to me how anyone could use this thing even in bright light the camera takes a few seconds to focus and shoot after pressing the shutter the prints are blurry and full of jpeg artifacts a remarkable regression from centuryold polaroid techterrible quality prints slow shutter
2094,1,camera would not work tried two different sets of batteries got help setting up and was advised there was a technical disfunctionget a working product the one received malfunctions
8381,2,i knew they were small but until you see them dont realize how smallsmall
17332,4,top  likes  cooks the perfect rice  easy to clean with removable lid components and  it sings to you when your rice is done you almost always cannot go wrong with a japanmade product ive had several rice cookers through the years all of them either tiger or zojurushi what ive learned is that products with these brands have poor quality if they were made outside japan ive spent hundreds of dollars finding the right rice cooker that can cook mixed rice white and brown jasmine without having the water spill out from the steam vent this is the first product where there was no spillage nor did the rice cooker have the cruddy brown residue from the starch of the rice i love how the lid has components that do come out which helps with cleaning and maintenance some other companies with similar features dont make their lids easy to cleanand what happens you end up with a dirty rice cookerwho wants to see that in your kitchen someone who reviewed this product mentioned that it is loud i have no idea what that person was doing but the sound of the induction while cooking is not even a major issue its still pretty quiet and who cares about the low humming sound youre cooking rice while doing other loud things in the kitchen even if the rice cooker is on and youre not in the kitchen its not like you can hear it from even  feet away i love the design of the rice cooker with the stainless steel look im also glad that zojurushi still includes a rice spatula handle whereas other companies provide free standing holders that can easily be lost or left unused anyhow my one and only gripe about this rice cooker why did zojurushi and even tiger do away with their retractable electric cords it seems like these manufacturers took a great leap forward in technology in cooking the perfect rice but yetthey took a huge step back in making the product easy to store and convenient for the consumer to zojurishi and tiger if you want your consumer to invest in this type of rice cooker because it isnt a cheap product bring back your retractable electric cordi guarantee that your customers will give you  starstheres so many areas of wasted space within the housing of the rice cooker that can be redesigned to incorporate a retractable electric cord housingbest rice cooker ever thus far
4304,2,ive taken this bag with me on local trips around the city about  times and once internationally so in about  uses on average the top pocket zipper has failed me completely the teeth wont connect and the zipper doesnt move now pretty much used as a a glorified storage back at home now i used my regular jansport backpack prior to purchasing this and my backpack zippers still work perfectly after getting beat up over the years i actually took good care of this bag and carefully opened and closed the zipper and it just breaks wont ever purchase again i suppose you get what you pay fordidnt last that long unfortunately
11045,4,this is a replacement for a  year old black and decker steamerrice cooker that i had gotten as a wedding gift from my mom i loved that steamerrice cooker and used it anywhere from  times a week all year round i would make rice in it from time to time but the majority of my use is as a steamer for fresh veggies from my garden yum unfortunately after  years and  moves it finally died i bought this one a few months ago now and have used it several times to make rice too early in the season for veggies but the garden is planted the first time i made rice in this cooker i followed the directions exactly and used the measuring devices it came with it is super easy to use simply plug in put your water and rice in the bucket and place that inside the device put the lid on and press the start switch no timer on this one when it is done cooking the switch pops up and it stays in a warming mode if you choose not to use it right away so i put the rice and water in per the instructions and after it was done cooking the rice was under cooked but there was no more water remaining had to toss out the rice as it was a big blob of stuck together under cooked rice so later that week i tried again but this time i used my usual rice to water ratios instead of the cookers recommendations with my usual measurements the rice came out perfect it is simple to use and cleans right up so super easy with a soft sponge and some dish soap no soaking no special soaps and no scrubbing just remember rice will need more water than its accompanying instruction book suggests i cant wait to try steaming veggies in it this summerit works great but needs adjustment to quantities
17325,5,"i eat rice almost daily sometimes stickyglutinous jasmine brown black purple congee rice soup sushi and a few mixesthis rice cooker is very nice but unless you eat rice daily and good rice i do not know you will be able to tell the differenceit is very subtle the rice is fluffier more volume and there are many nice prepost cooking options for the cooker mixing a few different types of rice together seems to be the best way to get great textureso far the cleanup has been easy and i have been rinsingcleaning the rice more than normal i was able to find a replacement inner cooking pot if this one becomes damagedi really like the induction cooking the rice is not burned on the bottom or one side it is cooked very evenly do i regret not getting the pressure cooker no this one will probably last me many years and my last one still works but the pot needed replacement so i went for an upgradeaccording to some research the teflon or teflon like material does not get hot enough to degrade because it cooks at a low temperature unless you scrape it with something rough it should stay where it is even if it does we eat a healthy dose of plastic per week anywaysis it worth it idk i can tell a difference"
6532,1,not great not horribleupdate battery is good for  minutes nowmedicore at best ok for the price
8070,1,i believe the light sensor is broken in this camera no matter how well lit or bright a subject is the photos are consistently dark producing under developed picturesseller please contact meconstant issues with lighting
2057,2,they say a picture is worth a thousand words if thats true then these pictures would only be worth about a hundred the definition is so low and the quality so poor that one wonders why they built the thing in the first place what a waste of time and effortwhat a waste
8270,2,like it was the one i order i did like that it was advertised for kids  to  years old and when packaged arrived the box said for ages  years old and package was delayed in transit twicei thought it was bigger but everything thing came with it like it said
16956,5, my old rice cooker voluntary decided to go to the trash can so i decided to buy new one and found this one on amazon it is great and well known rich cooker in korea and other asian countries best thing is we can keep rice warm for forever quality and design is so good easy to clean and nice touch display everything looks good and loving itgreat product
6599,2,camera takes good pictures but i cant get it to connect to my phone with the snapbridge app thought i could connect it to my computer but they sent a cable that doesnt even go to the cameranot horrible
9067,1,we ordered this film for an added goodie bag surprise for our childs birthday it was super cute to snap a photo and send it home with them we went through  rolls of film and there was not  rolls of film worth of people it kept jamming and getting stuck the film seemed not to turn out as good as previous film we used in the same camera overall it was not a great experience and we had to use our phones to just take photos instead super disappointingkept jamming my camera
3347,1,literally the worst camera ive ever used terrible picture quality if you use flash the picture will be almost completely white with no flash the pictures are blurry and distorted didnt know a camera could be so bad didnt expect much for  but i this camera isnt worth  camera
8812,1,disappointedcompared to others like the fuji they need to do better i expected better
8737,2,i would have given more stars for ease of use however this product should be  bucks and marketed towards toddlers my moms from when we were kids in the  shoots way better pictures the exposure cannot be manipulated giving verylow quality pictures except maybe on a sunny near the equator ill keep it just to zone in my rifle before hunting seasonjust get your kid to draw a picture
3044,1,this is a plastic piece of garbage do not waste your time or your moneydont waste your money
8329,1,i bought this for my young grandson for his  birthday based of the advertisement for  years as soon as i received the box from amazon i opened it took out the camera box and saw the label only suitable for people over  years oldonly suitable for people over  years old
1151,1,the videos very badextremely bad video
508,1,i regret buying it it doesnt work at all i put in several batteries and didnt works thats why im returning this productdidnt work
1046,1,i bought this as an alternative to having to give strangers my phone on vacation to take a picture of me glad i tested it at home the picture quality is worse than that of digital cameras  years ago i returned itterrible quality pictures
1073,1,poor quality cheaply madenot good
4548,2,bought this camera expecting big things but i was really disappointed the camera might record the whole  sphere in  but by the time you frame the video its much less i tried using this as a cycling dashcam and it was useless you cant see registration plates with it its ok as an action but i couuldnt see the value in the massive price point buy a go pro unless you want the  features  still dont expect anything spectacular if you do 
7817,1,ive ordered this album twice and both times its come with water damage to the insidereceived damaged
3543,1,i was going to give it  stars since the video itself isnt bad and the stabilization does work pretty wellhowever the software they were saying would be fixed to actually make it so you could plug in this camera to your computer to get footage instead of having to unplug it and use the sdcard directly which is very inconvenient with the media mod in particular now their software doesnt even launch for me even on a full reinstall and its marked as legacy software with no replacement so its just getting worse and worse very disappointingnotably the work arounds they push are utilizing the cloud which requires an ongoing fee when youre promised one easy workflow and then when it doesnt work they want you to pay more i for one am disinclined to go for itas for the actual camera its ok once you tweak the settings quite a bit needs changed imo but its just a one and done so its fine it cant function at all in lower light settings though and that doesnt mean full darkness once its even sort of dark the camera gets very underwhelmingthe main motivator for the  star review is the title  i wish i had bought something else and am writing this review to help provide a heads up to those of you camera shoppingi wish i had bought something else
3282,2,i didnt expect a lot but i did expect it to take pictures that werent blurry this is a very very very basic camera it cost way to much for what it does and doesnt do i was disappointed i bought for my birthday gift to myself and i dont like it at all maybe the video taking part is better but im not holding my breath i will film something and see laternot great at all
17319,5,this rice cooker definitely deserves full time realestate on my tiny countertop it makes outstanding rice of any variety using the measurements in the pot and also makes awesome steel cut the oats porridge setting when soaked overnight i set the timer and wake to the magical aroma and delightful tune it plays when complete i also have a second timer set so i can load rice in the morning and have perfect gaba rice when i get home from workwish i would have bought decades ago
7313,1,this was a refurbished unit after  days the battery still would not charge sent it back for full refundbattery would not charge
1060,1,not a good buy poor quality but cant return b uses my son took it out of the country on a missionnot great quality
6747,1,paper quality is badpaper quality poor
7911,2,the quality of the printed pictures is not the greatest details colors and quality is lost i wont get any use out of thisbad picture quality
11209,5,i bought this product while i was going on a trip its compact n easy to use if i put  cups of rice its more than enough for a family of  for  time the excess water coming out from top while making rice can be sorted by keeping a plate at bottom of the rice cooker which solved the main problem for me other than that i loved this cute product serves the purposevery handy
5814,1,i bought this camera to use for our business we had to work a wedding last night and i bought this camera to use to post some of our dj service pictures not one of my pictures came out i spent so much time trying to use different settings to make sure it wasnt my fault but no matter which setting i was on it would not take a good picture i had to use my phone for the night and it took way better pictures than this i am returning this camera its sad because it got great reviews and i was excited to use it but now im disappointed it may be good for outside use but definitely not good for indoorsmy phone takes better pictures
8173,1,it is not user friendly the app  you start the app connect to the cam and in  seconds in settings the app drops the wifi  i think a  year old wrote it   ok you get what you pay for well dont buy this and you dont have to would not recommend this productupdate  still junk avoid buying  update there is no help out on their site for xl boycott is the way to gowho writes a  star review for this product the manufacturer
8815,1,the photos were dark and little detail bought for my daughter who is  and she was very disappointed huge waste of moneyvery pow quality pics
2854,1,not user friendly very cheaply made rubbish from chinapoor quality difficult to use
25,5,my iphone need a wireless charger and this works greatwireless charging
6184,2,very stiff and not designed to be used while camera is on a strap best for tripod use or if you lug your camera around freehandnot useful for my needs
7139,2,the instax link works but the more i charge it it didnt seem to work after i unplugged it i keep holding the main button for  seconds or more it doesnt seem to turn on but when i plugged it it works fine another problem is when i print my photo the instax link turns off automatically because it keeps telling me the battery is low so have to keep turning on the bluetooth but sometimes the bluetooth doesnt want to turn on because the instax link cant find the bluetooth its so frustrating the instax link cant charge the indicator keeps blinking green meaning its almost fully charged but it doesnt work after i pull the plug i cant travel and bring the instax link without a charger i have to plug the instax link in order for me to print my photos so i got a defective instax link lithium battery i want to like my instax link but its worthless if i cant charge and bring the instax link wirelessly without a ac adapter with methe lithium battery is dead
4702,1,you like hearing that sound windows makes when you plugin a new device get ready to hear it a lot both the usbc and usba side exhibit the same behavior constant disconnectreconnect garbage dont waste your money on this oneconstant disconnects
3586,1,same as the gopro 
4818,2,i got everything except for the  film that i paid formissing films
4773,1,the light is dim and has no range its completely useless it is nothing like as described or shown in the photos followed the instructions and still had no useful lighting returning as soon as possiblekeep looking this product is nowhere near as described
2372,1,i must have missed where this said it had batteries instead of being rechargeable i got another instax camera for my kid years ago  assumed this one would be rechargeable like that one this is a real bummer  im going to return it before even using it for this reasonbatteries
719,2,if you are looking for a cheap digital camera and not concerned with picture focus this is for you it is hit or miss on quality of pictures taken flash is terrible and will not focus for close up shots get what you pay for i guessget what you pay for
2071,2,easy to use this was a nostalgia purchase the photos are very grainy and not as clear as my old polaroid picscute buy
1616,1,i tried to return the item but had passed the return window this is not wellmade and does not allow for highquality photos and theres no autofocus which is an included feature in almost any real camera these daysthis is very cheap and does not take highquality photos
1421,2,cheap plastic and terrible pictures but my daughter enjoyed it on our tripyou get what you pay fordisappointed
7741,2,i didnt expect miracles from the price of this camera but the buttons barely work and my  yr old needs my assistance every time id try a different camera if i were buying againbarely works
13410,5,"rice cooker made perfect rice i added  scoops of jasmine rice using the included scoop rinsed with water until reasonably clear and then filled with water up to the  line we let it sit for about  minutes after the click then stirred it up i didnt see any issues with bubbling up or splatteringmy wife loves rice as much as she hates change which is a lot her old cooker has lost all its nonstick coating and the pot is no longer available but she still didnt want to give it up she loved the rice cooked by this zojirushiits worth noting that the included scoop is not quite one standard us measuring cup this only matters if you want to use the water fill lines imprinted on the side of the pot if you measure out the water yourself or use your fingers to measure thatll work fine too of courseno fancy features just good ricegood basic rice cooker"
4203,1, in the order i order the camara with  film instantane but when the camara arrived just come whit two  i would like to send me the restcomplain
927,1,reason for purchase was to vlog for personal and youtube when i try video over a certain time limit my computer will not play video i have an older camera and it works better i videoed   min with the older camera this  wont ive changing settings and got no different results ill try a few more times but may be returning update rtngood camera
6043,2,id your kids want a camera they can take video with and then watch the video from the camera this is not the camera for you the sound does not work when viewing a video you made even when the waterproof case is offaudio does not work on video play back
1043,1,please beware that this seller will try and offer a full refund and gift card for a review that they then deny selling this product for camera is okay but pictures are always blurry even when i take the photosseller will try to scam for reviews
8296,2,the item was clearly used the gallery had  photos of someone else on it the item was not new as describeditem was used
7399,2,want to love this i understand what instant photos are supposed to look like i have had another classic square mini and wide many of these photos im taking arent turning out outside they are so white washed you cant even tell what the photo is of and inside they tend to be blurry for some reason for this price point and the price of film it is disappointingwant to love this but picture quality is lacking
7964,1,i have been waiting for fuji to release a hybrid instax mini camera for a very long time so when this one came out i got very excited and what a disappointmenti really dont understand what the purpose of this camera is i thought that for the price fuji would offer the best features of instax cameras with some cool hybrid optionsbelow are the features i am really   shooting options for different  a wide variety of filters to play withinstead you get a couple of filters an underwhelming app that allows you to print from your phone the sp printer app is miles better and a feature that allows you toadd a barcode to your picture so you can add recorded sound to iti dont find this camera fun to shoot with or to play withif you want to print photos from your phone on mini instax format invest your money on the sp printer i had mine for   years and still works perfectly and i can carry it in my bagif you want a hybrid to have fun with filters and different shooting modes not as cool as the  neo go for the  but it prints on square format nothing against it but i am aware some people dont like the squareif you want to keep with the mini instax paper and have all the fun go for the  neo classic still my favouritethis camera is way too expensive for what it iswish list i do hope that fuji will release a cool mini instax hybrid in the future hopefully with the looks and shooting features of the  neo the fun filters of the sq  and the app features of the sp printer 
14305,5,its a very good and nice product i had to return it only because its too small for my household size but can u please hasty up with the refund process i would really appreciate itgreat and recommendable product
7772,2,very cheap product broke after  hour of use selfie camera never worked wouldnt recommendvery cheap broke quickly
6903,2,tldr if you use this camera in a relatively active setting expect it to break because shaking it up a bit can break it go for mini series far cheaperive gone through three of these cameras already just because i love the wide format so much but i think after this third one im done with it the first one i bought was doa and somehow a renewed version was in perfect working condition in comparison the second died after i kept it in a shoulder bag loosely while i was at an amusement park the third one eventually died for similar reasons i wouldnt hound fujifilm so hard for this if there was at least another accessible alternative for this film that was more robust if you purchase this camera protect it well when using it a padded camera bag will suffice and dont toss the bag around lolthe settings can be pretty finnicky too sometimes gauging whether or not you should use the light or dark settings can cause you to end up with several shots that are under or overexposed i wish i could have used this enough to have gotten used to the settings but the novelty of it isnt worth the cost of film and using it that often i think that the mini cameras are surprisingly more durable and way more affordable to replace or buy film for i definitely got the wow factor from people for using this particular kind of film but i would say it isnt worth it just go for the mini series and enjoy the instant filmanalog novelty for cheaper  a shot adds up when you like to shoot a lotvery cool pictures very fragile build quality
253,2,screen is very dark hard to see your image in normal or even better enhanced light real problemscreen is very dark hard to see your image in normal or even better enhanced light real problem
3054,1, well i hate to give something such a low score but i wasnt able to upload any pictures from the device without its data card the last camera came with one but this one did not the camera itself is a great way to get little hands ready for bigger more expensive cameras the components are built into the housing and seem to be pretty solid construction came with a tethering cord and carrying strap basic instructions and a promo card to update the data card for free after leaving a review and submitting it back to the company this time it was a fail for this cameradata card not included this time 
1512,2,very cheap quality with terrible picture its as good as something to be won in a vending machine not worth the money 
3628,1,we got my daughter this camera for christmas she used it maybe  times and now it will not turn back on i tried new batteries i cleaned the battery terminals and all the other steps that they support video said to do it still does nothing very angry that i spent the extra money for the namebrand assuming i would get quality i didnt now whatwont turn on
7211,2,not sure because of my hand or not when i am using this i cannot control the buttons freely in most cases i cannot reach the dial i use my m mode  of the time and this is not helping when i need to change the settingsstudy but not for everyone
13767,5,wow what a difference in using this one compared to the other brands finally the rice came out perfect no more juggling the time water levels the angle of the moonpricelessrice to the occasion
9689,5,enjoy steaming rice  easy and like the clear lidperfect size
4871,2,this was a gift for my son to show him how film can develop and how to aim and take a photo with a viewfinder rather than a screen complete fail the viewfinder is not lined up at all he told me it wasnt so i tried it  photo of mushroom half of mushroom viewfinder is worthless quality is not great either photo isnt clear but to be fair polaroids werent either way back whenview finder not aligned quality not great
6642,1,the picture quality is booootttttyyy if youre gonna spend  on a camera invest into a better camera because it is not worth it i rather take pictures and videos on my phonetrashhhh
4393,2,i purchased four of these frames over the past  months three of the smaller version and one  for my house a year ago initially we loved it being able to upload photos on the go through a simple email account is amazing friends and family can send images which are downloaded for your viewing pleasure and you can manage those photos via a free online account add to that the clarity of the nosmudge screen and the concept here is well worth the  price tagbutat the beginning of the summer i had to unplug the frame but not move it to make room on the outlet for a fan after two weeks of being unplugged my wife urged me to get her photos back up and running so we changed the fan to another area and plugged the frame back in it hasnt worked since never moved dropped or got wet i had another doctor in my office who has an electrical engineering background test the power brick and it was fine we tried plugging it in another location in the house at my office and with a different power brick to no availat this point im at a loss theres absolutely no reason for the frame to just stop working after  months of flawless operation simply because it was unplugged for a couple weeks hence the two star review im frustrated and while i probably should have said something three months ago when it first started sometimes it takes a wife to light a fire under a husband to do somethingworked for nine months
7127,1,super weak plastic and it came damagedcame damaged
2600,1,it says it had  printing sheets and it came with only 
3876,1,item was broken on arrival sd card slot was brokenpoor quality
4112,1,i had this camera system for less than  years and shelved it because it was not living up to expectations and required way too much time and constant maintenance and attention first off arlo has literally  tech support unless you want to pay for it if you try to solve things on your own your forced to use customer forums to review old threads for answers to problems that are generally soleveable about half of the time but heres the real issues hardware and software updates come automatically except when they dont and turn  out of  cameras into bricks easy fix with the force update option except its not the update still never comes i am talking about  months of waiting and not having access to  of  cameras for no reason you can email arlo but get generic responses you have tried the only way to truly fix the product that should work automatically is to pay for their tiered tech support  no thanks i pulled them off the house and replaced them with wyze cams and have never looked back have saved sooo much time in my life no longer have to change batteries every few months and never lose a camera feed not to mention  wyze cams cost like  so i got  cams for  to replace the  arlo outside ones  of which worked and then bought  more wyze cams for inside as well setup is ridiculously easy you do not need a hub and i cant recommend them enough over arlo if you want a system that works out of the box continues to work without issues for a fraction of the cost do yourself a favor and be wyze i meant wise anyway just add cheap  sd cards to the wyze cams for free  hour recording storage for no limitations and subscriptions needed you dont have to rely on clips anymore you can go back and watch the entire month if needed do i need to say more about wyze i think that tells you everything you truly need to know about arlo in the enddont go arlo be wise and buy wyze

5787,2,after my panasonic lumix  got flooded and died i needed a replacement and got the powershot  the reviews on the web were all very enthusiastic but the image quality that this camera produces was never deeply discussed unfortunately i found most photos to come out of the powershot blurry dim and washed out and i am talking about photos taken on a sunny california day i bet one can get better results with an average smartphone sorry canon i was really disappointed and ended up returning the camera on the positive side the menu system is easy to navigate and the camera is light and not too bulky hence easy to carry around but so what i think these days it no longr makes sense buying budget cameras for less than  since smartphones make a lot better job in this price rangesadly not a great product i returned it
2561,1,the camera was great until it stopped holding a charge you cant print pictures while its charging so its basically useless this camera was opened christmas day so its had less than  months of usewont hold a charge

1736,1,bought this to take on our cruise charged both batteries one battery lasts about  pictures then dead also the battery goes down quickly just reviewing the pics it was a giant disappointment because i knew i had to limit the pics i took each trip out got home and  days past the return window keep searching past this one the the price i expected morebattery life is horrible
7391,2,randomly stopped working one day and instead was zero help they told me just to buy a new one i had it for a few months before it broke and it was greatstopped working
1059,1,purchased this camera for  year old daughter who didnt like the quality at all the camera feels cheaply made more like a toyhad to return
703,1,bought this camera specifically for my first alaskian cruise and the second time i went to use it it had a large block of black lines in a square covering  of the viewfinder wouldnt reset when closing and reopening tried all the modes and nothing made the lines go away and unable to take any photos as the shutter button would not depress so unhappy that i didnt get photos of our trip do not buy this camera for a once in a lifetime eventruined my alaska cruise didnt work for more than a day
7767,1,i dont know what happened but the screen broke on second day our   year old had it so easily could have dropped it but certainly didnt throw it who knows but i wouldnt recommend this product and would not buy againbroken screen within first day of use
2063,2,was excited to try my new polaroid but i tried setting the timer and it never went off tried again but i guess it just doesnt work i followed the instructions in the manual and everything but it wont take a phototimer malfunctions
720,1,extremely slow shutter speed to take pictures feels like a cheap plastic in hand like a childs toy camera i really dont like it different memory card than pictured  seller charged restocking fee for the return item not as described  i would not recommend this camera or buying from this sellerslow shutter speed and difficult shutter button
7514,1,i bought this because i have a cheaper cell phone and thought since it was  or at least  that the video quality would look like hd quality and it doesnt my old hero  gp has better quality from  plus years ago i feel like they are not telling the truth about the actual specspoor quality videos
8818,1,idk whats wrong with itthe photos are ridiculously poor quality and just dark nearly impossible to see do not go with this camerathis camera is horrible
6539,1,was using this product for a very important interview that lasted hours and the light just stoped working despite being plugged in after about  now it will not turn back on and i am furious because this interview was very important and was virtual like everything these days i will hopefully be able to send it back and get either a new one or my money back 
17310,5,throw in what ever mix of rice you want and your preferred amount of water and boom rice no need to punch time or anything it does it for you steaming things is easy as well with this honestly a great productperfect rice easy
2098,1,only received the camera with batteries and smudges on it nothing else no case accessories or film was included and a paid for everythingincomplete and damaged
4823,1,got as a christmas gift out of the box the lights on the front dont stop flashing and it wont turn onload film the directions say to replace batteries while on to fix it doesnt next step is to contact seller but the link to seller on amazons product page doesnt work would not buy againdoesnt work out of box
3305,1,thats what i get for buying a last minute gift for a kid dont think i can return it because i threw away the packaging to repackage it for gifts i dont know how anyone that leaves a  star rating can get a good nights sleep the picture quality is horrible and the pics may be the size of a  mph picture but there quality on my phone  years ago blows this out of the water pics in a well lit living room are too dark without flash pics with flash are blown out like the flash is right on top of the lens maybe some minor fixes could be done messing with settings between pics but the settings menu is slow to navigate taking pictures it randomly goes to a black screen for  seconds and sometimes going to menus will do the samenot recommended even for kids
1177,1,not a great product cheaply made foldout screen already feels like its gonna fall off not sure why  reviews except they buy themnot worth it
11922,5,"ive been cooking rice and various grains in a pot on the stove forever recently i had several surprisingly bad attempts at cooking white rice  for the life of me i dont know what i did wrong i ended up looking up pressure cookers even though i didnt want one and eventually stumbled into the world of rice cookers i didnt want one of those either i would rather have less specialty appliances than more but as i read and learned the history of rice cookers good ones just not every  dollar attempt at one i understood why people got them then i read about various models what they did well how they worked and decided on this one then i tried to change my mind because its not cheap then i figured if im getting one i need one well actually usethere was a warehouse deal on one maybe like  percent off it said it was in very good condition so i took a gamble knowing i could return it when it arrived it looked brand new only it wasnt in the original box still packed tightly with all the parts in a regular amazon box it turned on sounded fine the appliance itself is so cute and so easy to move around and has a retractable plug so its super tidy i just love iti immediately put in a cup of the same white rice i messed up twice recently rinsed it  times filled it with water to the white rice  cup water line and pressed start it came out perfectly better than ive ever made it on my ownits been maybe  weeks now ive had whatever white rice i first put in it white basmati rice jasmine rice and now brown basmati rice even though ive never liked brown rice much now ive had brown rice at least  times and i seriously love it i made barley in it  filled to the brown rice water line  and that turned out great since it apparently is similar waterwise to brown rice once it was done i put some cooked brown rice back in it and left it on the warm setting mixed with the barley it stayed perfectly cooked and warm til it was eaten a day or two later i even actually made rice a roni mexican rice in it once  even melting butter in it first and that turned out fine if i make rice a roni again i think ill first sautee the rice in a pan with butter because i think it shouldve been a little more al dente but it was really fineregarding warming its crazy how good the rice tastes even  days after it first cooked it doesnt use much electricity for this feature i believe i read approx the amount of a  lightbulb which means its quite low the cooker is quiet and when just in warm mode is not too hot to touch when its cooking the rice its also fine to touch anywhere except near the steam ventit cleans very easily its not very large maybe a little smaller than the footprint of a standard coffee maker but half the height because of how cute it is and the carry handle i will be bringing this to family functions in the future where rice is needed literally one of the best purchases ive ever mademy only complaint but with a fixthe cooker comes with a sturdy steam basket a very useful rice paddle for fluffing  serving theres an attachment thatll hold the paddle when cooking rice and a measuring cup but the little rice cup and paddle dont fit inside the cooker with or without the steam basket i know me and i know i will lose these if i cant tuck them inside well the included cup is actually  of a regular us measuring cup or  ounces i had several sets of measuring cups here and one fit snugly inside even with the steam basket inside the measuring cup height is about  inches or  cm tall and length is about  inches or  cm long i think its oxo brand the paddle issue was trickier first i tried to find a tiny bamboo spoon to use but rice really stuck to it so i actually used a small saw and sawed off the end of the plastic white paddle i sanded the rough edges a bit with sandpaper but you could get by without doing that now the paddle is about  inches or  cm and the paddle my measuring cup and the included steam basket all fit inside the cut paddle still sits comfortably in the little holder when i cook ricehas my review been helpful to you if so would you consider hitting the helpful button below id greatly appreciate it thank youdidnt know i needed this but i did"
3363,2,cheap camara i expected better qualityi expected better quality
4993,2,we purchased this for our daughter for christmas she had a great time with it for the  months it actually worked even taking great care of the camera and keeping it in its case it has just stopped working weve replaced the film and batteries with no luck its extremely disappointing especially since we just spent a ton on film she cant use i would be wary of this camerawas greatwhile it worked
11103,5,"it works great and easy to operatemakes perfect rice every timegreat rice cooker"
491,1,not only were the included batteries dead and the camera broken beyond repair when i got it the seller has my camera now and is refusing to complete my return dont buy from them if you want a functional productbroken and useless
717,1,opened and read through the quick start manual realized that it does not take aaa batteries as described the use of aaa batteries was the sole decision for my purchasedoes not use aaa batteries as described
11054,4,decent rice cooker small size it would be better if it had a power off button rather me having to unplugged it otherwise it will stay in warm status which eventually hardens the rice i would be another one with a power off button and one the keeps rice moist even in warm status at a higer price point for this point it would be what you would expect thoughok for a small rice cooker better if it had power off button
12715,5,wife loves it and saves a lot of timeawesome 
8160,1,got a gopro hero after wasting my money on this piece of carp but im stuck with this useless camera as amazon will not take returns on it app crashes or stops working all the time connectivity is spotty this unit must have image unstabilzation as the video is almost unwatchable user manual is unclear as are the instructional videos with are confusing and the remote has serious bugs and goes berzerk  had to restart my phone to stop it from taking nonstop burst photos frustrated beyond belief cant edit videos on a computer ugggggggggg customer support is obviously from some other country as its in broken englishdont waste your time or money as i did spend a little bit more and get a gopro hero  they are only  right now the build quality app footage etc are so much superior to this thing and the value to cost is amazingno returns on amazon app is horrendous video quality poor and results in unusable giggly footage
2709,2,the camera is easy to use but the picture quality is terrible i understand wanting to save money because in my case this was for a toddler but there are better cameras in this price rangebad picture quality
926,1,the video quality is poor the video file will declare hd resolution but when played on computer it doesnt look hd quality also the microphone plays back very poorly as well people are passing this product off as good for kids and amateurs but my cheap phone which cost under  does a way better job this product should be priced around  video quality
6428,2,it does not hook up to my cellphone like the gopro so it sucksit does connect to you phone
1067,1,i would not buy this again nearly  for something that didnt work and was poor quality a phone from  would take better picsterrible terrible terrible
1068,1,the user manual should be instructions on how to complete a return save your money and time dont buy thisterrible quality

3831,1,bought for my daughter for easter item didnt work at all will not turn on after being plugged in all day kept glitching when i tried to turn it on wouldnt take a single picture now it wont let me return it even though i still have  days to return the item absolutely ridiculous im so disappointed item also looked used when i opened itwaste of money dont buy this
7554,1,i bought this action cam for my occasional hiking and recording my tennis matches there are  big drawbacks to this camera  video quality is really poor compared to the mainstream brands like gopro dji etc if you are not looking into details and if you are ok with video looking like it is filmed in a decade old cell phone then this might be the camera for  battery life is also really poor per battery i ended up swapping batteries almost  mins and it has become a nuisance worst part is it will not save the video if the battery dies in the middle of a recording i have lost tons of footage this forced me to stop recording my tennis matches and even when hiking this kept bothering that i have keep reminding myself to keep change batteries and even than i couldnt get more than  hours of videofinally my sd card slot stopped working it no longer holds the sd card in place and that marked the end of this camera for me as it no longer can recordi really wished i had saved money to buy a good one and now i have to buy one please dont make my mistakeplease dont buy spend some more and get a quality action cam
4194,1,i ordered this one because it came with  sheets it did not it only came with  not come with  sheets
1598,1,at first camera worked as it should after less than  hours it freezes if you try to change modes and will not do anything else unless you pull the battery out to shut it off returning and replacing hoping this was just a faulty one will update when new is receivedfreezes up first day
3706,1,in the images on the listing the lcd looks crisp and bright it is neither of these things it is blurry and dim in reality even with a fully charged battery the battery doesnt last long at all it should come with a ac adapter but it doesnt the hot shoe mount is very weak too it broke the  time i used it and tried to lock it at an anglenot the quality level advertised
9249,2,my kids are having fun with this but i wouldnt pay for this the print quality is super grainy and distorts the picture also it only prints in grayscaleanother issue i have is that the camera malfunctions randomly ht printing only half of the picturenot a great thing but entertaining for my small children who are too young for a real cameracheap
5601,1,this camera is absolutely awful the coloring is all off no matter what settings are used and i couldnt get it to focus for the life of me waste of moneyterrible better off using your phone
8518,2,i received the longawaited camera straight out of the box i was disappointed to find a nice glossy little phamplet like a quick start brochure with beautiful pictures and captions all in japanese ok  that was a disappointment so i start digging and found several large struction manual which include smart amountgs of english  but i really had to hunt for them and the print is rather small for my eyes i will need a magnifying class and yellow highligther to figure out the instructions and steps i will wait to review the actual functionality ease of use and quality of photos first impression was disappointing because of the lack of english info camera is heavy and seems well built i hope to be pleasantly surprisedfujifilm instax mini  intial unboxing
3563,1,the camera record  minutes then it automatically shuts down try several times but the same issuedont recommend to buybuy camera  hot  malfunction
8192,1,bought  of them thought they were for full spectrum or ir mode for paranormal investigating they were not as i hopednot for ghost hunting
6965,1,this camera wont open and broke after one use i got a super protective camera case and everything but it wont open the lenses at all i am not happy with those company and the product i want a replacement itemdefective product
6173,1,not only is it super bulky and oversized making it really inconvenient to use but water still somehow finds its way in at least in mineyour better off with a hotshoe umbrella much more convenient to carry and install and actually keeps the camera dry sure it wont be sufficient when the rain is coming from the front or side but neither is thiscamera still gets wet
8846,1,im brandnew to photographing wildlife and this camera is incredibly easy to use there are a lot of settings but after messing around with it a bit i found the ones that worked the best for me the optical zoom is the best part i included a photo that is not zoomed in at all to show how far away i was from the bird feeders where the birds i was photographing were well worth the cost in my opinion but im a complete beginner so take that with a grain of salteta after about a month the battery stopped charging no matter how i charged it pc usb wall socket usb and the camera wouldnt even turn on i called amazon tech support and they told me to call minolta i called minolta and it turns out they dont even have a camera tech support department anymore so i contacted amazon again and they will supposedly be giving me a full refund once they receive the camera from upsso it worked great up until it died a premature deathgreat to begin with died within a month
6151,2,this product took two hands to operate im an appraiser and need something smaller and easier to snap the phototoo bulky for everyday use
17626,5,if this rice cooker is in your budget buy it we just had the best brown rice i have ever had it was perfect the programming is super easy and i love the handleperfectly fluffy rice
6838,1,i read the reviews and i took them with a pinch of salt and went ahead and got this camera anyway as i wanted something for my  year old who expressed an interest in photography as the interest is probably fleeting i did not want to spend a lot polaroid has been a solid presence in my life since the  but oh boy did this camera change that it is impossible to get a decent picture i tried repeatedly using a variety of settings my tech savvy husband tried for almost  hours just to get one decent picture  no bueno the manual is not the manual for this camera and the online directions for use do not address anywhere the fact that it is almost impossible to get this camera to focus i went ahead and bought a cheap generic camera off of ebay and it does the job  x better so in summary listen to the majority of the reviews and dont waste your moneyif you are thinking of buying this camera stop do not waste your money
7511,1,the audio when recording on my bike sucks theres no way your gonna like it this is the second one i tried an its just sub standard returning it for sure this company has constantly tried to bribe me with another camera if i erase my bad review of this but i wont both cameras sucked an i got a go pro with a external mic it sounds awesome get a gopro an be done with it this camera sucks bottom line no amount of bribe will change my reviewnoise

33,4,i purchased a pair of these  wireless charging pads at  with extra  discount definitely a good valuethe charging pad has one led light it is red in idle and turns green during wireless chargingthe charging pad charges my pixel  xl pixel  pro and pixel buds smoothly i connect them to normal power adapter instead of  adapter the charging current is  not super fast but good enough for me the charging pad should reach full speed when connected to  power adapterso far i am happy with this purchaseworks as intended with good value
2606,1,its a piece of crap and doesnt work i bought  of them and half the time neither worki wld  percent never buy a product from them againproduct is junk
5583,1, the picture for product is very deceptive normally the package for the film comes in a box like this and has  picture not  so i thought i was getting  boxes of  not  picturesdeceptive picture
6004,1,the gopro didnt perform to the expectations that i had after reading from multiple reviews its too expensive for a very laggy touch screen and very hard to navigate throughi do believe that this is a useful tool for people in sports but not for artistscreators 
13417,5,only one button super easy to clean out the stuck on rice bits a top tier rice cookerlove it
1682,2,not that goodquality  sound 
4376,2,you might be better off buying a small smart tv or repurposing an old  i bought this frame for my  year old grandmother i really loved the idea of being able to email new pictures to her picture frame so i bought what appeared to be the biggest and best on the market at the time however the picture transitions startled and scared her she had no cognitive issues but had some vision problems i couldnt find a transition setting or a position in her living room where the motion didnt bother  the picture quality is good i now use this frame in my home and i really like many aspects of  the  gb ram doesnt seem to be nearly enough in  and it didnt in  when i bought this frame either i bought a  gb memory card filled it with some  pictures and letr rip unfortunately the frame seems to only load about  pictures at a time i reduced the number of pictures to  then to  then to  and i then resized the pictures to  i switched memory cards i switched to a usb flash stick no matter what ive tried the frame reacts the same it picks roughly  pictures out of all of the ones on the cardive found that if i unplug the frame let it sit for a few minutes and plug it back it in the frame will sometimes display a different set of pictures like i said i really like the pictures but the performance especially for the price is underwhelming id give the frame  stars if it handled large numbers of picturesgranny hates it and it refuses to handle large numbers of pics
9319,4,"you can purchase rice cookers with many more features than this one however it would be difficult to find a rice cooker that is simpler to useyou wont find any presets on this device you only get two simple controls keep warm and cook for people experienced at cooking rice this is all you will need for beginners you may have to experiment a little in order to figure out the timing which will depend on the quantity of rice you are cookingthe keep warm setting is useful and keeps your food pretty hotconsidering that this unit is only about  i recommend it however just be advised that this unit cooks the rice and keeps it warm but lacks many of the features and presets of more expensive unitsa barebones rice cooker thats easy to use"
3079,1,filled it up with sand and first time i picked it up the strap ripped off on closer inspection it is only attached with a single line of stitching so no wonder plus the velcro doesnt keep the sand in very well so you end up with sand on your floordont waste your money
335,1,super disappointed waited over  weeks to arrived came in damaged when i take picture a red light messed up all my picturesdisappointed
8559,1,worked for a few months never dropped it or hit it on anything or left it in a car in extreme heat or cold yet the lense will slide shut if i tilt it up too far the strip on top where the pictures come out is coming out of the camera it was cool or a little bit now im just disappointed and have a crappy camera wish it wasnt too late to get a replacement or refunddoesnt last
902,1,sound settings are terrible always sounds distorted no matter what settings i am usingterrible sound
3063,1,we bought a set of  cameras one of them didnt work from the start and after several frustrating online chats with the company they sent a replacement camera the other camera started out working okay and we got a couple of great wildlife photos but it also took a ton of photos of nothing after only a few days it had taken  photos and thats the max you get without buying a monthly or annual plan we chose to buy the unlimited photos plan for  annual cost since then the camera basically stopped working then we received the replacement camera and that one started out the same way captured a couple of deer photos and then a zillion photos of nothing so once again within a couple days it took the  photos max and we paid another  to get unlimited photos on that camera too the second camera is within sight of our housewe have seen deer and a fox walk directly in front of the camera and even linger there for some time no photos were taken we even walked in front of the camera and again no photos taken total waste of money very disappointeddont waste your money
3351,1,this camera is junk not even good enough for my  year old the picture quality is horrible if you try to use a flash and someone is a few feet away you just end up with a washed out face horrible had to returnjunk
153,1,viewfinder too small to look through picture quality not that good also size of pictures too small 
4448,2,resolution is only marginal but the two biggest problems are that it hangs up frequently and the screen goes black then it will only play the stock demo photos loaded on the frame a couple of my sd cards have become corrupted and unusable even after reformatting im not certain that the frame caused this but i have a couple of other photo frames different brands that have run for years and have never had a problem with either one of them i dont think ill purchase another pixstar productresolution is only marginal but the two biggest problems 
8869,1,camera didnt turn on  had too return for a full refundjunk
11087,5,loved itmade rice for making sushi worked perfectly
14086,5,so i bought this rice cooker to feed my self i thought it was going to be a little to big but it was actually the perfect size it could probably feed three people but i would honestly say  i thought i had a defected one at first because the instructions say to press first press menu second white rice third press start the buttons make a beep noise when you touch them but when i keep pressing start it wouldnt beep so i thought i might have a defected one but i started to hear it turning on you could hear a little sizzle so i realized it was working i have made rice in a rice cooker in forever my rice came a little mushy but still delicious which just means its a good rice cooker i dont need to put so much water in it im honestly very happy and hoping to give the other options a try sometimei love it
4503,2,it is truly a hybrid camera one part digital and one part printablenot analogue though it takes digital photos the sensor is not the greatest you would rather want to take pictures with your smartphone and printed it out through this camera the digital print is not the same as the analogue vintage print that we expected it to be even with the flash on we cant capture the same exact print style of an instant camera  is fine but it cannot go the distance as a digital camera nor as an instant camerawhat i think could make this camera wild is the ability to add custom filters and effects the grain filter is by far the fakest 
3203,1,have a rebel  and its like it wont connect it fits on the body of the camera but wont actually flash when trying to use it unless im just stupid but allthe settings match up so i dont knowdoesnt work
6384,2, i cant blame the manufacturer it is all my fault in one small sentence the camera is a cheap webcam hyped up a bit with added featuresresolution unfortunately the quality is like going back to a bad  x  res expanded to  the audio sounds like its recorded from a coffee stiring straw and the bit rate like  lolmenu easy to navigate comprehensive but when in sunlight you will have difficulty seeing the screenscreen extremely cheap display looks like a cheap misplay from a cheap digital photo frame or toyvideos it records avi files which run great and it takes serious amounts of data per recording like if it is recording  but the quality is just disturbing honestly i am a professional videographer trust me i got  cameras and record to bluray for weddings and eventsbut with all this considered to have the capability to sneak it under water and be water proof its ok for child level fun to be able to dunk the camera into the water and to produce some underwater video is okremember this is a  ish camera considering what it does for that amount of money it lives up to its  luckquality matches price 
8826,1,total waste of moneyvery poor picture quality
13107,5,cooks rice as advertised very easy to operate and cleangreat rice cooker
1042,1,i ended up having to send it back it only had enough storage for  pictures and the camera was confusing to use you get what you pay for if you buy a cheap cameraget what you pay for
1909,1,camera works ok but not one accessory came with no film no case nothing at all extra what a rip offno accessories came with camera
8058,1,no matter what i photograph the resulting image is faded out of focus and indistinct also when i remove the black lens cover the white ring it covers insists of remaining attached to the black lens cover i went through one entire package of film with a single usable imagevery disappointing image quality
4193,2,some of the film packs did not have  pictures in them they were short film other than that its a great cameramissing film
621,1,this is literally the worst camera ive ever used its cheaply made and the photos are awfultrash
195,2,takes great pictures but there is no mic connectiongreat starter cam but no mic connection
11118,5,ive used this pot countless times to cook both white and brown rice over the last  years purchased march  and it still cooks rice very well some of the nonstick has come off the inner pot and im not sure how it got dented but its still working ive lost the steamer pot and the measuring cup over several moves but still have the paddle which is still great buy this it will last at least  years and  months lol maybe ill update this review at   year revuew
2756,2,cheap plastic some of the buttons stuck picture clarity isnt great might be good for a child to use i returned itits a cheaply made camera
705,2,quality is sub par pictures with flash always blurry waste of moneynot worth the cost
3113,1,many of the packets of film didnt work at all for the price it was not worth it the worst part was that it was christmas gift so my son was very disappointed i would not buy this film again from amazonmany packets of film did not work at all
5289,1,was great when it worked stopped working within weeks of first useone star
7245,1,so ive never purchased a gopro before i bought this because i wanted to film while i painted i set the whole damn thing up then released unless i connected it to my iphone i could not see what in the hell i was filming or where it was pointing there is no live preview ive never ever owned a camera that didnt at least have a viewing slot i had to use the live preview on my phone which drains the battery very quickly i did a lot of research before i bought this but nothing mentioned that after  minutes it splits your video into another video i understand that it probably has to do that because the file size for a  video is very large despite that it still made things very frustrating i only filmed for an hour before the camera got way to hot and i worry that its gonna break if i try to film for that long again would not recommend to anyone or purchase again save your money and invest in something that isnt clearly refurbishedno live preview gets really hot when wifi is turned on
3510,1,bought for my son for camp charged it before he left by the time he tried to use it at camp it was dead and he couldnt take any picturesdidnt work
7150,1,i purchased the bundle on amazon for an xmas gift it was supposed to come with  sheets of the printer paper but came with none i could have gotten just the printer for  other places have emailed the manu  amazon  with no resultswas not a bundle
2058,1,i bought the camera for my boyfriend for his birthday when i gave it to him he was excited and loaded the film the film wouldnt load and the damaged light came on it wont load the filmby the time i gave it to him for his birthdayit was passed the return so now im stuck with a broken cameracame damaged
12730,5,first ill start with all the good stuff i like about it so people wont get the idea that this is not a good rice cooker great rice cooker and i like the fact that it allows you to choose between not only different types of grain but also different size of grains as well i found that not all rice cooks the same and the amount of liquid varies between different size of grains it is also a plus that it can saute which is ideal for turkish pilaf and can also steam the con for me personally is there is no power onoff button i found myself constantly searching for the power button especially after finish using it it just feels weird that you cant keep the unit plugged in and have to unplug to turn off every time i was always told to never pulled the cord off unless of emergency and here i am having to constantly doing that exact same thingi love this rice cooker
7750,1,this thing not only takes horrible photos but its also way too complicated for a five year old the fact that it goes back to the menu after looking at a photo is annoying she also had difficulty actually taking a photo returned this one for a vtech kiddizoom camera and she loves itdont bother
948,1,although the description and a video shows a battery charger twice it arrived with no battery charger why have two batteries if the only way to charge is to plug the camera in and not be able to use it while charging this is misleadingno battery charger included despite description and video
8258,2,we just gave this camera to our daughter for christmas the front camera does not work just the selfie mode cant return it since we live outside the us is there anything we can do to fix itfront camera does not work
4725,1,the first one lasted two months i replaced it because my daughter was upset and wanted another the second lasted six months the most recent issue is the power charger the port pushed in i cant charge the camera this thing is really junk waste of money please dont waste yours i will try to find another one for my daughter that is better quality good luckterrible quality junk
4094,2,product has potential in being a premier product but i cannot recommend product to a nontechie to purchase and i have to live with the products limitations if i am able to find a different vendor who can supply a better product i would be willing to just shelved my current arlo  camera systempros  battery operated and  access and remote control through mobile  ease of setup for the basic  cloud  motion  night visioncons  significant delay between motion detection and recording received many notification that appear to be false since nothing is  record time for each camera can only be adjusted via using a custom mode which can become tedious prefer a global command in adjusting record  installation and user manual is sparse and addresses basic setup had to resort to faq and user community and you tube to get answers and detailed instructions on problems during setup so need to have the patience of a techie to systematically pursue a  geofencing function seems to be easy to setup for a single enabled device but adding an additional device is very problematic and suggested fixes via the user community gets complicated because of the different user configurations and setups its difficult to discern from the community as to what is my problem with geofencing versus what theirs were and hot to fix it arlo support team should be leading the way versus the user community trying to collectively help each other thats pretty weak support when each camera costs around  there should also be an easy test procedure to check out the proper geofencing setup so i consider the geofencing feature as alphabeta code i have already tried about  different suggestions as to how to fix my problem with geofencing i will continue pursuing the problem because i want to be able to fully use the feature but i do have a life and can only spare so much timearlo not ready for primetime use by nontechies
3550,2,overheat after  min of video recordingoverheat
3067,1,cameras dont work for long product support takes over an hour and resolution normally not found have four spypoint cameras and plan to change to new types id you love waiting on hold with product support this camera is for uproduct support
1432,1,biggest piece of junk do not buy this its a waste of money trust me i bought this for my  year old for christmas he loves taking photos but i didnt want to spend a small fortune on a camera since hes so young the batteries i put in never work the picture quos horrible he takes one picture and it shuts off he picked it up today and the batteries werent working as always so we tried to switch them out well guess what the battery got stuck in there cant get the battery out and the metal piece for the battery holder now has broke its a piece of junk your have one disappointment kid of adult if you buy this thingbuyer beware
14122,5,just use it cooking rice taste good and fit our familygood looking and applicable
7811,2,the cover was thin and deliver brokencover broken
12415,5,i love this rice cooker super easy to use and clean very straight forward and doesnt take that long for it to cook the rice 
5465,1,this camera is light easy to use and has a long zoom lens but i found three flaws that made the camera  the view finder has a small focus wheel to adjust for you eyes on this camera the wheel is very stiff and it goes from one extreme to the other too quickly making clear image for focus very hard to  the touch screen stays active even when using the viewfinder so every time i use area focus or spot focus my nose touches the screen and relocates the focus point to the edge of the screen i could find no way to turn this  the zoom loses image quality at full zoom short of full zoom the image quality is excellent but zoom all the way out and the image becomes fuzzyi wanted to like this camera
4784,1,quality is good but its not bright and wont any professional light to ur pictures or video 
4771,2,well light is ok for the size  but it keep going down to the front while im shooting or filming just not not happy 
6727,2,this bag would be a homerun for me except the fact the dividers arent sturdy if youre in and out of your bag to switch equipment the gear shifts arounddividers are awful
10501,5,my favorite part about this is how easy it is to clean it makes the perfect amount for one or two people of course but knowing i can clean it in less than a minute im way more motivated to make rice even when no one else wants some or i just want a littleso easy to clean
1791,1,gave the camera to someone as a gift and they loved it sadly within a day or two the camera malfunctioned the last  days of trying to get in touch with fjifilms just to told i have to go through amazon but even they dont even have a option for an exchange or refund highly disappointed id give it zero stars if i couldwhy is requesting an exchange or refund such a hassle
5285,2,paid much on this dealtwo stars
7536,1,avoidi purchased this camera to use as a bikecam helmethandlebarshere are the issues ive had with it in just two   im getting just under an hour from each battery my settings are  loop  minutes image stabilization i guess part of someones biking routine should be to make frequent stops for battery   the video isnt clear enough i hope im never hit by a vehicle that then drives away but if i am this camera will be useless i watched the videos from my first ride on my large  photoediting monitor even though the video was shot in broad daylight the license plates from the cars coming towards me or passing me were   you have to set the date and time every time you change the battery i set the proper date and time yesterday  when i went out for my first ride when i went out this morning and realized it was dead i swapped batteries and went on my way after putting the card in my pc i see video from this morning was for  instead of  camera fails on every leveltotal failure
2338,1,my daughter loved this camera unfortunately just after a month of having it the screen does not turn on anymore making the camera useless really unfortunate that we spent  on a birthday gift that didnt last long and now my daughter is trying to save up for another will not allow her to buy another one of thesescreen stopped working after a month camera now useless
527,1,i returned it it would not go beyond step onejust stuck therei returned it it would not go beyond step 
2859,1,its hard to find a decent affordable digital camera and i have a good camera on my phone but i dont want to always use my phone this camera is affordable and comes with everything you need but the quality is not good its cheap and the picture quality is awful they also offer to pay you  to write a five star review dont believe this hype at all its wrong to trick people this camera is awful horrible photos
6564,2,returned  now waiting almost  weeks for refundcamera did not work  and yes i had batteries correctly in place
6495,1,great price and provides great lighting but ive found after a couple months there are some frustrating  at full brightness i find the battery does not last very long at all i find i often cant finish recording my videos because the batter goes bad much quicker than the advertised   i bought  usb cords to leave them plugged in to a power source while using and that still doesnt seem to help as theyll only last a few minutes longer than the battery pack aloneunfortunately this makes near useless for what i need unless youre taking pictures over short time spans i recommend going with a better option that has better batteries or a powered connectioncheap but very limiting
5370,1,i bought this for my daughter because she wanted it i could not believe how bad the picture quality was like this is actually worse than the polaroids from the  it would be fine if it was really cheap but its not i returned it and bought her a low end android phone and a little portable canon photo printer for barely any more than i paid this piece of junkterrible picture quality
1949,1,purchased based off the multiple statements that this camera has built in stablization when trying to shoot a video with the camera braced  in no wind you would think i have a minor earthquake going on looked for stablizing controls in the camera and could not find any waste of moneyterrible  shakey and bad videos
3346,1,i thought this would be an easy starter camera for my noncell phone child it lasted one photoshoot then would only turn on for  seconds before not working again return  refund was an easy process amazon shouldnt sell this productawful
5478,1,i have a variety of digital cameras for different uses and was looking for a relatively inexpensive point and shoot with a viewfinder to take on vacation as sun glare off of the lcd screen makes using my other one canon powershot  difficult the lumix  looked to be a good option and had good reviews so i decided to purchase it within  hours of receipt i requested a refund and it was on its way backit boasts a  zoom but picture quality at any magnification is extremely poor auto focus does not work half of the time and manual focus is clunky and difficult to use while framing a shot low light functionality is terrible to say the least and it has a digital viewfinder which you have to press a button to switch between that and the lcd screeni definitely do not recommend this camera and have no clue how it got so many high reviews do yourself a favor and stick to canon or nikon panasonic should not be making camerashorrible camera
594,1,as a professional photographer who works with a lot of big companies and brands i know my cameras inside and out my wife ordered this camera for my my  year old son to take on trips he received it in the mail so being a camera geek i wanted to check it outthis is not a  mp camera the resolution is that of a cheap childs camera where you can see a ton of noise and grain with no sharpness or clarity even the old point and shoots from major brands back in  were better than thisthere are a lot of  star reviews for this product on here that are validating a lot of wrong information about this camera which makes me speculate as to what they received for their reviewthis should be marketed as a cheap childs toy camera and sold for significantly lessvery cheaply made
4840,1,not very happy with this purchase this camera package was supposed to come with  boxes of extra film but when delivered it only came with  items in package
945,2,purchased this camera as a gift tested easy to set up when using battery good for about  hours guess thats why they give you  im sure my granddaughter will like overall the  ultra hd camera is like throwing money out the windowbattery life sucks
6859,1,i ordered this camera for my grand daughter last christmas because she wanted a blue polaroid camera because she was out of the country it took  months for me to give it to her to my dismay and total disappointment the camera never worked even when we put brand new batteries in it i could not send it back because it was more than  days since id received it so i lost on both counts  disappointment for my grand daughter and the money i spent to purchase this camera ive place a lot of orders on amazon and had a few issues but nothing to this extent dont buy this camerathis product is no good
949,1,returned this immediately after seeing the poor qualitypicture quality terrible
5038,1,i couldnt be more dissatisfied with this camera every single image comes out so overexposed you cant even tell what youre looking at buyer bewarecrap
14723,5,cooks well keeps rice warm for long periods without making it crustycrunchysolid rice cooker
4247,1,does not lastbattery
1126,2, its not a bad camera but its not what it says it is eitherits a trap its a trap
6061,1,cute looking camera no flash fuzzy pictures hard to navigate horrible directions do not buydo not buy
14840,4,the product was delivered without the lid contacted customer service and they replaced the item works really well it lost a star as time goes on the stainless steel starts to look fadedcame without the lid
2470,1,camera was awesome but a year later it doesnt turn on and stays stuck on the welcome screen go to ask for help and it says my window has closed for supportawesome camera if it works
8877,2,i like the feel of this camera and its easy use quality of photos is very good unfortunately the camera quit after one year i get a message that lens is obstructed and the camera will not turn on ive tried everything i could to get it to work a camera should last many years not just onefailed in a year
5469,2,zoom range is great although quality drops off a both ends as expected on this class of camera what was really disappointing caught me totally by surprise is that the panorama is really low resolution nothing approaching the full capability of the sensor in a horizontal sweep the best vertical resolution is  pixels you are limited to the vertical field of view of the sensor in landscape mode but you dont even get the  pixels of vertical sensor resolution you get a down sampled  pixels see page  of the advanced manual for the sad details on pano specs also there is no way to shoot a horizontal panorama holding the camera in portrait orientation to get a bit more fov and resolutionok for posting online but not for printing but even posting online you cant zoom into it without pixelating right awaydisappointing because virtually any smartphone will allow you to making a horizontal pano using portrait orientation and will thus allow you to have at least  to  the vertical resolution of the  even the less desirable landscape orientation on a smart phone will give  the vertical resolution for a horizontal pano i will be returning it and select another  superzoombridge cam that allows full sensor resolution and also allows portrait mode camera orientation for horizontal panospoor panorama resolution on 
14726,4,"ive been using this for a month and im pleased with it it makes decent fluffy rice but when it comes to making porridge it spilled off from the top venting ive followed instructions correctly and putting lesser amount doesnt change the outcome i had to rolled up a rag surround the vent to prevent it spilling all over my countertopthe self auto cleaning is just water steamingso make sure you still wash the partsso far so good"
2666,1,play video after reading frustrated customer reviews i made sure i opened this and tested before giving as a xmas gift  everything looked fine out of the box  all pieces and parts accounted for the sd card is already in the camera  after reading the broken english provided in the manual the company suggests charging fully before use which is normal  i plugged it in and it was charging fine showing a little battery icon display on the screen similar to that of an iphone  after about  minutes of charging the icon was showing  charge so i unplugged it and went to take a few test pictures annnnnd  nothing  you can hear it turn on and off and makes noises when pressing buttons but no display screen  i then tried turning it off and on multiple times with the same result  i plugged it back into the charging cord and still had the same issue  i did briefly get the screen to show up for a few seconds before disappearing once again for good  from what little i did see it looked fine and easy to view and navigate but didnt have enough time to really try it out  i obviously received a lemon so promptly returning for a replacement  will see how the next one works but i have attached a video of the issues i had with the first oneno display screen after initial charging
14259,4,i have owned and used this rice cooker for about  years now and it is a fantastic machine i use it for white rice brown rice multigrain rice steelcut oatmeal and porage i gave it  stars instead of  for only one small issue the water indicator line in the pot is not perfectly accurate for me especially on the porage mode i make porage for myself and my grandchildren all the time for porage i recommend for  cup of rice put water about  to  below the porage  cup fill line and it comes out perfect otherwise it is extremely watery on making white rice the water line is almost right on except for me it is slightly dry so i actually add just slightly above the water line on the rice water marker about  and it comes out perfect on my machine other than that small issue i would definitely recommend and i would purchase againi highly recommend this machine use it constantly
7654,1,only the camera came package did not include the film or the case super disappointed because this is a christmas present so i dont have time to return and wait for the correct bundle to be sent so i was basically overcharged for an  cameradidnt get the bundle only the camera
8084,1,unfortunately im not able to return as the window period close too soon dont purchasethe quality of the picture are terrible
2368,2,there are many other reviews about the benefits and fun of the instax but something just didnt sit right with me this camera has the exact same internals and features as the instax mini  but this model is roughly  more you are paying a premium for the look and design some people may love the design but if you only care about the photos look into getting the instax mini  it has the exact same exposures shutter speeds and focal distancesyou are paying a premium for the look over the mini 
13230,5,"good for family of  if youre a loner just get the smaller version for the cheaper price but if youre a loner that loves to eat get this works well for steaming bread cooking rice and if your up for it steaming asian style cakeswe make   cups of rice easilynice"
14777,5,for the first time in my life i am happy with the rice cooker first of all beautiful shape of the product excellent plastic quality very smooth and quiet on opening and closing it is not too big not too small very easy to wash and maintain internal metal parts are qood quality too i tried to cook different types of rice and other grains and i havent been disappointed yet it does great job highly recommendperfect
7839,2,it gets the job done for the majority but thats nothing to praise most pictures come out heavily zoomed in on their own and you end up wasting a lot of time and materials trying to print them in a normal format the printer definitely has a mind of its own with the coloring and cropping problemwouldnt recommend
7216,1,this was a good item however displeased by how hard it is to remove it it caused scratches on my camera body and ended up throwing the thing in addition ir proved difficult to get it off a tripod wouldnt recommend thiswont recommend it
6002,1,so its advertised as being able to upload from the camera to the cloud for which you pay an annual fee it turns out this is not the case and they continue to market as such it simply doesnt work i have tried   and samsung  no go on either in fact connecting to the phone in generally is sporadic at best here is the note i received from them todayour team is aware of this issue and we regret any inconvenience this may cause unfortunately at this time we do not have a solution to resolve the problem we will do our best to notify you if a fix is found and please keep an eye out for updates to the product which may include changes that resolve the problem thank you for your patiencewhat the say before you buy itfast reliable connectivity super easy super fast transferring photos and videos from your cloudconnected gopro to your phone is simple and versatile with your choice of effortless wireless upload via the quik app or a lightningfast wired connection via usb theres also unlimited cloud storage with hasslefree auto upload just plug in your camera when connected to your home wifi and the camera does the restdont waste your time 
8185,1,ok on my  xl returned the first about to return the  mic cable issue on both  unit will not connect to remote first didfirst would not connect to  did got fast support on first none so far on  been  days nowflip a coin
5364,1,i purchased this in january for a present for my daughters birthday which is in october she just opened it and it was broken right out of the box the powers light flashes on and off and she is unable to take pictures i have tried to get help from both amazon and the manufacturer and they both have directed me to each other and wont help with a replacement or repair if you buy this take it out and test it before the end of the very short amazon return window or you may be wasting your moneydoesnt work and cannot get customer service
5069,1,i want to like this camera it takes great pictures and video and is easy to operate why i dont like it i doubt it has any stabilization built in i have never had a camera that has such jitter video in fact its unusable for video unless on a tripod i guess i should have known for the price but other reviews brag about stability so i thought it would work but not working for meterrible stabilization nice pictures
7613,1,arrived without bolt to tighten leg of stand base is not very wide which would cause instabilitypoor quality control
14896,5,ive no idea why rice cooker made rice way better than i i couldnt cook rice right on stove top my rice always hard or mushy rice cooker made perfect rice go figurecooked rice right
2851,1,screen doesnt work on the back horrible camera and my daughter is very dissapointedhorrible
401,1,very pooor sound qualitywould not buy
6504,2,i really love the power and glow of the lighting however the battery life is terribly short and you cannot use it if it is plugged in as it constantly flickers and turns off perhaps i received a bad model but i would not recommend purchasing thisyou cannot use if plugged in  batter life is terrible
8874,2,i shot with this camera for  hours and was disappointed this was a friends camera and we exchanged cameras on a shoot me with the kodak pixpro  and he with this minolta while the minolta is close the kodak is better with a faster focus and sharpness they both appear to be made by the same company in asia i much prefer the kodak  i do know kodak has excellent customer service and will replace a camera if defective do check with minolta if they answer the phone the kodak is priced less toono too buggy go with the kodak 
1064,1,does not have touchscreendoes not work with remote for selfiedoes not work with remote
8591,1,this camera is a waste of money image is very bad the light is too low for any practical purpose and i really doubt the image is really  dont buy itbad image low light not even clear it is really a 
7360,1,very small wand holding the lens thus only useful for drawingtransfer small images onto your canvas or any other surface you are drawing on not a good value for what you get i was not expecting to be able to draw big images but this is just a toy not for professional usenot as expected and expensive
8905,2,i bought this camera just to take some better pictures i thought minolta was suppose to be a decent brand i guess theyve gone down in quality the battery didnt want to charge correctly it finally charged over night the battery must have cooked in the process because when pulled it out it had swelled up and was bulging at the sides good luck in finding the exact fit with the notches on the top of the battery the app works but you have to do some fumbling around between the wifi of the phone and the camerabattery is junk
14094,4,i have never owned a rice cooker so this is probably on me and not the actual unit i expected to be able to cook more than i was able to this is  g of rice and  ounces of water what i make for a standard dinner i dont feel like i could fit one more grain in this cooker it also took  minutes to cook where i do the same amount on the stove top in  it wasnt very expensive so i will probably keep it as i expect the end product will be consistently cooked rice every time and it will free up a burner on my stovecooks less rice than i expected
5993,1,the camera is ok and not much better than that but the quik app is simply awful it wont recognize more then one camera because who would ever use more than one camera it works about half the time is slow and poorly written and then the camera the touch screen is not easy to use not very sensitivethe batteries run out quickly and it takes multiple noteasy steps to change the battery im truly sorry i invested so much in this frustrating set up i hope you dont make the same mistakego pro should be ashamed
4001,1,i bought this for my wife for christmas and she finally got to use it the pictures came out blurry and have no use for this camera i wish i could refund
2061,2,purchase this camera for a charity event i used polaroid  film the pictures are horriblepicture is of poor quality
6456,1,we bought two of these and reviews must have been given something one of the cameras has had the chip fall in not where they belong at least twice i think there is a second chip in there also i got the chip out once and thought it was a fluke thing to happen but it happened again and the chips dont come out much the other we have not had it happen to going to have to prob break it to get the chips out very upset and a waste of moneydont buy
1997,2,the shipping box was fine but the box holding the camera was messed up i want to take a picture before i give it as a gift the camera film came out bad because the inside was broken and the charger is broken as well i tried to charge and it didnt workbroken
2003,2,we took several pictures christmas morning as i was a gif both with and without flash and they were all so very dark and bearly veiwable it was extremely disappointing seeing my mother crazy excited about this gift only to be waiting   mins for a film that was still to dark too see i was useing color i type and i will probably return this item for a refund after my mom gives up on it  out of the  pics it came with were crap and buying the film is  a picture if thats how the polorids are gonna come out its a total waste and let down from the originals back in the daydark crappy pictures
552,1,terrible camera good pics and good videos but downloading is a freaking nightmareworst camera i have ever had
7414,1,first picture was done with my phone the picture i took with this insta camera came out super dark on the same lighting not worth the money selfie mode was even worse i am using the film required for use as well save your self the hassel and buy a different onenot worth the money
8380,1,be sure to remove photo film from camera when sending for refund i did not remove photo film got refund for camera but not the filmphoto film

604,1,if you saw digital cameras trending on tik tok and want to get one steer clear of this camera i got this cause it was affordable compared to most cameras but its not worth it at all it feels super cheap  not even worth the money youre better off finding a  sony or canon camera on ebay and etsy also the photos only look good if theres a lot of light the flash is pretty much uselesscheap af

5295,1,this might be the best camera nikon has ever made yes i own the d single digit bodies but arbitrary choices by nikon marketing have made this unusable for professional photographers take for example the  cord not working who on earth thought it would be a smart idea to disable the afassist on this cord how about no commander for cls on camera nikon thinks it can sell more flashes and other higher end cameras with this strategy but really all it does is make the consumer angry take away the ir capability in  then bring it back for this camera why nikon marketing obviously everyone complained and they were forced to add a feature they deleted the previous year to save a few pennies this kind of nickel and diming by nikon has gone too fari understand soccer moms dont even know what an  is i understand not everyone needs cls or remote capability but to arbitrarily defeat these features in order to sell me a  shows nikon doesnt care about its most loyal customers give me the option to pay for these things via firmware like sony but dont just write off a perfectly good camera for professionals because you want to push me to models with higher marginsunderstanding capitalism is painful to me and product marketing isnt exactly my forte but if nikon continues to make dumb decisions in order to get me to buy a camera i dont really need i wont be buying anymore nikon cameras and i have owned dozensnikon went too far with the disabling

8917,1,the first one i ordered would only stay on for a few seconds so i returned it i ordered a replacement to try again the  had same problems both cameras flashed a message in an unrecognizable foreign language and then shut down one of them moved the zoom out and it would not retract both had batteries that were hard to get in and out the instructions are not clear and theres no decent customer service these cameras are not of the quality that the old minolta brand  cameras  neither would stay on
8382,2,the back literally broke the first time a took the back off the camerabroke immediately on opening

1148,1,battery would not charge very cheap feelingcheap cheap cheap
8845,2,the minolta camera seemed ok but the selector knob stuck i returned the used cameracamera was defective
7110,2,i was specifically looking for an album for my instax mini photos with a hardcover and this was suggested its flimsier than a trapper keeper and the slots are already ripping as im gently inserting photos if you are interested in a diy project this would be good for making your own cover and bindingpoor quality
5897,1,after printing three photos the camera died it would not charge and would not turn ondied after  pictures
1658,1,picture quality very bad and missing sd cardpicture quality very bad
6433,1,play video i made sure all the protective coatings were removed before use i charged the battery as needed and on the first test this was the result i thought maybe there was a setting that i had wrong went through the settings adjusting the resolution etc things never improved i was being very optimistic about this product since there were so many good reviews i am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend anyone waste their moneypicture is blurry out of the box very poor quality
1495,1,its very light and cheap made poorly as welldont buy
3427,2,i got this to try out before i use them for my wedding as something fun to do for guests every picture ive take with it has come out like the camera has been smoking for  years in the house they are really yellow orange hues and the printing is not consistent i like that you can put the micro usb card in it and it saves all the pictures you take but other then that youre wasting money on paper trying to get just one clean picturepictures are yellow
4507,1,for the price you pay youd expect a much better build quality the camera is completely made of plastic and it feels like it will fall apart in your hands it takes ages to focus and the screen reminds me of the distant past it definitely doesnt feel like something that was released recently how disappointing ive sent it back for a refund and i cannot recommend this to anyone 
3837,1,this is a piece of plastic junk the picture quality was just awful it was so cheap i couldnt even use the tiny buttons i have a  year old  megapixel camera that does a much better job dont waste your time and money on this scamtotally useless
7504,2, not wanting to drop a small fortune on a gopro i researched action cams and came across the akaso  pro it seems like a good deal for the price so i jumped and bought two the camera came in nicely packaged and in working order i ran a test on it with my kids outside playing around and it seemed to be good the real test was yesterday when i took it to the river for a fishing trip the camera itself did fantastic good clear footage and it held up fantastic for underwater fish releases overall i am pleased with the camera my only two real complaints are that the mic isnt that great and the battery life on  at  is only about  minutes i have read that the lower settings will make the battery last longer i now have  batteries for itproscost ease of use vivid color saturation touch screenconsmic battery lifeupdatethis is the second cam that has done this after being left on for multiple hours it worked fine friday morning for  hour while hunting it was left on and used for a third angle pov went through  or  battery changes and periodic recordingnow it will not turn on changing my review from a  to a  as this isnt something that should be happening my wonder is if the cam is getting too hot and causing damage it was warm to the touch but did work fine on friday  first one that quit working was used as a chest cam fishing and ran for  hours before having the same issueoverheated
7100,1,shockingly low quality images not only print wise but digitally very pixelated and not worth the high price of a kodak which i expected a lot better from had an old basic polaroid and the quality was  times better than thisreturning today as i cant believe how bad the quality is you would think it would be one of the best because its kodak very cheap plastic feel as well and froze on first use and cannot remove the battery so had to let it run out before charging and attempting to use it again you are better off with those basic polaroid cameras 
7662,1,the camera doesnt work and the film isnt with the package i would rather buy it at walmart if i had known this would happenno dim
4919,1,i have tried several different sd cards new and used nothing works the camera is useless it was sent overseas and now outside return window steer clear of this productwill not format sd card
3780,2,bought this for my  year old play with and make videos its cute and is easy for her to figure out but the video play back is just static the video function was the main reason i bought this camera and she cant use it i have a very disappointed  year oldpoor video
546,2,it has taken me a long time to learn this camera and years ago i did photo journalism for a living back in film days this thing does not auto focus as it should the auto flash pops up at the worst times and i got two external flashes with it one had dog bite marksyet teeth marksif i did this again i would send the thing back and just buy a new one this was not with it but its too late nowdont buy refurbished
460,2,i was not comfortable with this camera after using nikon  for a long timenot comfortable switching from nikon
8469,1,the box came without the battery and charger camera and strap were missing their sleeves the item description says it includes the battery yet camera color options say camera only so its confusing im sure the camera itself as a product is great im writing this review to bring awareness to other buyersopened box with missing items
8453,1,the film was just a waist of my money very disappointing bc it didnt work in my kodak bluetooth portable printer which makes me very upset and unhappy with thisit was ok
14751,5,i have used this several times now and i must say it works and cooks rice perfectly no issues whatsoeverworks perfectly
5519,1,this camera takes some time to learn after using it a few times using the screen viewfinder i wanted to try using the small viewfinder eyepiece with diopter wheel all i can see is a grey square and darkness there is no image ive looked everywhere to ascertain if there was a setting or trick to get it to work to no avail i have to send it back this is a replacement camera for one i previously purchased same make and model that was delivered with the shutter button missingdont purchase
6436,2,these things are junk the price is attractive but the video quality is terrible and no where near  that my  does in  i gave it a shot ordered  of them i think ill send the un opened one back also note they come preset to  video and  in usa we are  good luckcheap junk as expected move on
873,1,easy to use but very poor picture quality and colorsave your money
13411,5,i bought the zojirushi rice cooker for my daughter shes a newlywed and said they needed a way to cook rice that would consistently turn out well ive used a hitachi brand that my mom got me and started looking on amazon the one that looked most like it was this little  zojirushi  my daughter says its perfect it cooks rice perfectly each time its easy to clean and its just the right size for their little kitchen were all very pleased with this wonderful rice cookergreat little rice cooker for two
5046,1,bought for graduation son was loving taking pictures with guests broke after  pictures utter waste of moneyworthless dont waste your money
3723,1,instead of  colors of diffusers it came with only green the battery is defective too its all puffed out on one side and wont fit in the slotgot all green diffusers battery puffy
1837,2,i have gotten two replacement cameras to fix this issue they are both stuck on selfie mode the shutter doesnt open unless the selfie mode pop out is popped out therefore every single picture unless its within three feet is blurry waste of money i would rather have the instax  backin the first picture you can see the selfie mode popped outsecond picture the selfie mode is not popped out the shutter wont openthird picture shows the shutter only open when selfie mode engagedboth cameras i received were like this defectivestuck on selfie mode wont focus
10632,5,this rice cooker is perfect for making rice for only one person it is much easier then trying to make rice on the stove and avoids the ever present pesky problem of having rice stuck to the bottom of the pot the rice comes out perfectly fluffy and moist every timequick and easy
276,1,terrible instructions i bought the case for the camera but it only fits when all accessories are removed and there is no space for accessories the camera arrived defective it would not read sd cards piece of expensive junkdont buy
8397,1,photos are small which i knew however the print quality is horrible i have now returned to a photo printing station at the big box storetoo little too much
6153,2,pictures are of a very poor quality camera body is very cheaptoo much money for such crap
7989,1,bought this and charged for long for it not to work even bought film and put it in and screen still doesnt work and cant use it extremely dissatisfied 
3377,1,the pictures are always blurry it has no macro setting and the flash only produces pictures that are so bright theyre too washed out to see an imagethe pictures are always blurry it has no macro 
6271,1,i was excited about this camera so once i received it i unboxed everything and set up the backpack the kit comes with so i was extremely disappointed when actually taking it out to take photos of scenery and people i was frustrated and ended up returning it exactly how i packed it up in the backpack and sent it back hopefully no one else experiences the same with this camerablurry pictures
7366,1,this is awful you cant see a thing waste of money dont buyleo decia
4429,1,i give this product a zero not even one star cheaply made worked for a few days and then stopped turning ondoes not work
8227,2,i bought this camera to act as a dashcam while im riding on a motorcycle however there is a problem with that the camera will sometime freeze and you would loose all the footage of that time its impossible to know it froze unless you take it off your helmet the only thing left to do at that point is force the shutdown it seems to work better using the standard video modethe drift ghost app could use some improvements the fact that the camera is wifi makes it difficult to connect to the live streaming is also very convoluted and cannot be done onthefly you need a few minutes to set it up via qr codeoverall i am disappointed of my purchase but since i started using it months after ordering it covid reasons i could not return it 
6645,1,i purchased the camera because it had an ap that allows pictures to be sent by email after getting it i find out the ap does not work with  i should have purchased a different cameramisleading camera information
9467,5,"i love these theyre inexpensive and give you a perfect cup of rice every timeusing the provided measuring cup add one level cup of white rice three cups of water a sprinkle of salt and a few drops of sesame oilthe trick to keeping the rice pot working well is that there is a minor hump in the bottom of the inner pot when cleaning it do not press down on it if you do it will flatten and wont conduct heat evenlythe second issue is the black coating inside the inner pot if that gets scratched the rice will adhere to the silver metal and overcook unevenly they supply a plastic spoon for scooping the rice out without scratching the black coatingperfect rice every time"
6313,2,worked nicely for a few weeks and my daughter loves it but now she can only use it when plugged into the wall which means it can no longer be used as a portable camera but for games instead expected more for the price so we are disappointeddoes not hold a charge
6775,1,i could not even get the  sprocket to turn oni sent it back for a replacement and the  one would not turn on eitherboth were worthless and i ended up sending the  one back also for a refundthis was not even worth the  star i had to give it i wanted to give it a no star rating but the system wouldnt let methis was a piece of junk
1509,1,this camera is not what i wanted a kodak easy share is way better live and learn instructions very difficult typical chinese junk guess i just threw my money away 
7925,1,play video really disappointed on this purchase me and partner love taking polaroid photos that we have decided to look for something small and portable like thisbut when i added the picture the case is too small and i cant close it i dont want to damage the picturei rather just buy an album boomdont buy
2485,1,listen if you heard all these good things so did i do not waste your moneythis camera is just cute no focus horrible quality and a complete waste of time and money i was so much better off using my iphonemy worst tiktok purchase
7764,1,this was made out of extremely cheap plastic i wanted something a little more grownup and sturdy for my  this was not it the kidizoom cameras were better made and cheaper than this there is no zoom and the picture clarity is poorpoorly made
7121,1,play video the front covers are not hard these are made of cheap thick plastic maybe you can find something similar at the daiso stores for  or even dollar stores definitely not worth the  quality
5057,1, please resend another camera we try two film and it never startthe film not coming out
8747,2,i double checked to make sure i ordered the white camera with  prints but only received the camera and two prints the camera also had stickers on it which wasnt a big deal but is a little strangedid not come with film
7221,2,it would be nice if they included some instructionshmm
7376,1,not what i expected returned awaiting refundnot impressed
2460,1,this camera did not work it didnt focus you push down a little ways to focus then push all the way to take a picture even though i had the camera off during the time that i was not trying to take pictures the battery died quickly i have to return it very disappointed i dont recommend this productdidnt work didnt focus battery died quickly have to return
2198,2,i like that it is compact i dont like that the lighting isnt up to par backgrounds come out gray no matter what settings you use on your camera to pay all that money and still have to spend time and money cleaning your photos up so the background is white such a waste of time and money also beware i did not buy a previously owned item and it came with blonde hairs all over it and a little dirty on the inside i dont have pets or blonde hair so that was pretty grossmine was definitely pre owned upsetting when you pay full price
4058,1, updatei have contacted arlo support multiple times and have gotten no help always the same pasted try these steps that i get every time i contact them none of the steps fix any of the issues i have i have sent hundreds of messages and replies to the cases i have filed they stopped talking to me because my free support ran out i had to pay  to get them to respond to me after buying a year of support they continued to tell me i was not a paying member and they could not help me i got this messages from two different people days apart i had to submit a screenshot of my account that stated my service membership this  was another complete waste as none of the info provided fixed my issues they stated these are the only things we can do to try to fix it and that my problem was hardware my hardware was out of the  year warranty and there was nothing they could domy issues my cameras go offline after a short amount of time usually under a week i have to bust out the ladder and climb up and bring the camera into the house to the base station and resync it i have done this now with every camera multiple times the batteries are now lasting about  weeks i was burning thru batteries all the time so i bought rechargeable ones another  into the system all the cameras are set to best battery life my schedule is set so that the system only runs when i am away limiting the time it is actually recording so every  weeks or so i have to bust the ladder out again swap batteries and resync again when the system does manage to stay online the recording of motion starts way late theres roughly a two second lag from when i would expect the motion to start and when it actually does this is the most important time to record the recordings of my front door completely miss the person walking up to the door and only get them walking away completely uselessi have tried everything i can think of and tried everything they told me to try i moved my base station to the main floor and that did not improve anythingi am extremely disappointed in this product netgear and arlo i was expecting so much more for what i paid for this system and what it said it would do this is the last time i purchase anything from these companies and i recommend anyone stay away from them as wellmotion recording takes way to long to kick in even at  completely miss people walking up to the front door and recording starts when theyre walking away contacted customer support and they said there was nothing they could do batteries do not last long at all ive had to replace them twice now to keep this up its going to cost a fortune i really had high hopes for this system app and interface work well at leastupdate  system is completely down  stars
14754,5,yeah right its made in china sure the pot coating doesnt seem to be rock solid and this is taking nearly one hour to cook half load of rice but theres that price me as a korean i strongly approve this cooker as a perfect entrylevel cooker been using it for nearly a year and the pot coating had been scratched due to several mistakesnot using sponge side of dish sponge  putting metal utensils inside the pot etc etc however coating seemed to be quite sturdy enough if yall looking for the actual rock solid inner pot you guys gotta get the stuff w xwall but by that price point you probably wouldve gotten two of this one idk its the right price with right product rice quality is pretty good it gets cooked all nice and stickyi prefer soggy rice over the typical rice coz it makes the rice dryness right after  rice does get the yellowness  wateryness after  botan rice and this usually means that batch of rice went bad  unless youre actually going to have the rice  yeah really  have the rice all the time this isnt the right product for you but with simplicity and how compact it is there is nothing better than this cooker dont be silly about what you got you really do get what you paid forhyundai elantra of rice cooker
14899,5,tired of having to stand alongside oatmeal while cooking in a saucepan to make sure it doesnt boil over tadaaa  this rice cooker is perfect first  i toast about onehalf of a bag of bobs extra thick oatmeal in a large skillet with one pat of butter takes about  minutes  have to watch and stir often do not leave the oatmeal while toasting  starts to brown quickly toward the end allow the oatmeal to cool completely in a different bowl stainless steel is best to dissipate the heat store in refrigerator in an air tight container using toasted oatmeal makes a great taste and textured oatmeal breakfast to cook a portion  spray the bottom of the rice cooker with nonstick spray and add onehalf cup of toasted oatmeal to the rice cooker  along with one and a quarter cups of water cover and walk away take a shower shave  whatever in less than ten minutes you will have perfectly cooked oatmeal waiting for you can also use to cook oatmeal that hasnt been toasted  takes a few minutes longer to cook wouldnt cook oatmeal for breakfast any other way now you can double the measurements for two servings note  previously used a nonstick version of this rice cooker  however the coating began to flake so witched to this aluminum version and simply spray the bottom with cooking spraylikely great for cooking rice  i use it for cooking oatmeal
1795,2,i havent used it yet but when it arrived it looked to be in used condition ill update once i get a chance to try it outthis looks used
1026,1,we bought this camera hoping it would be better than the  year old one that we have been using especially since it had more than  the megapixels however upon receiving it we found the pictures were worse than the camera we had before the last one i changed most of the settings in an attempt to fix this but the pictures were still horrible maybe it is bad quality control maybe it is just a bad product but needless to say we are returning iteither it is a bad product overall or i got a bad one
4775,1,you got to be in the person face to really see a differenceyou got to be
1078,2,this camera does not have a flash whats the point in having itno flash
5703,2,the camera itself is very cute it functions perfectly i was super excited to purchase this as ive wanted one for a long time however the quality of the pictures are terrible and when it prints out it makes it worseit was deceiving to see the example photos that the camera does online because it gave the impression they would be clear but the photos come out super pixelated i tried adjusting the paper or switching out the paper in case it was bad i charged it all the way i tried all the different lighting settings it had as well as going outside for natural lighting and it didnt make a difference  im thinking about returning it honestly the older polaroids that print automatically had better camera quality than this newer versioni was super excited to purchase this as ive wanted one for 
7782,2,not great bad pics a waste of money reallyi wouldnt buy again
8892,1,tried new batteries naturally removed lens cover have only used this thing about  times in two years no one in my area repairs minolta and having a hard time getting tech support from manufacturer garbage unit worked fine for two years get the  year warrantybarely two years old and it wont turn on remove lens cover warning
5402,2,all this camera is good for is being a toy for kids it takes pictures and videos and got few other options but quality of the output is very sad for the price id expect it to be betteron the upside battery life is decent and it is of decent built quailtygood as a kid toy
6714,2,ok so i have had a few camera bag and i love the idea of this but the product just didnt measure up i wanted a compact day pack i have a travel backpack already from boundary supply they are greatback to this bagits very mushy and not sturdy which i kind of figured but its more so then i thoughtthe texture in the pic looks way diff in person in person it looks like it will collect dust on it very easilyas others have said the velcro dividers are not great in them which is truei like the look of it shape design wise but it doesnt hold the shape very welli wanted to like this and i even got it on sale for around  and i still dont think its worth the price let alone the full price of around  this feels like a bag that should be around  bucks and if it was id prob keep it already have a return label ready to gowanted to like very badly
1919,1,the pictures never appear on the filmthe pictures never appear on the film
5687,1,i tried these for my daughters polaroid snap camera and they are all coming out blue its over processed i was told the camera was good so i tried another brand and camera is good so its the paper thats not gooddoes not work
7187,1,since the day i got it i had issues straps wouldnt stay attached constantly slipping out screw on plate wouldnt stay tight gave it a few months chance but wasnt worth the money at allwont stay together
3593,1,the new sensor and bigger battery seem promising but i was really disappointed the camera turned to brick when i tried to upgrade it overheated after  minutes of useoverheating in  minutes
1940,1,i like how it prints pictures after taking them i bought one here before but ive lost parts of it so i decided to purchase this new onebut im really disappointed because somethings wrong with the camera the next day films started printing when i havent taken any pictures yet it kept printing  stopped as one film was stuck it froze  wont work again i changed the batteries  it was doing the same thingdisappointing
1077,1,this camera worked for  months augoct stopped working all togethernot to mention this one was a replacement for a initial order not received stuck on view only do not buy thisjust terriblelasted  months junk
1971,1,camera feels fragile like a plastic toy in your hand pics were grainy cant imagine any flogger taking this out doors i returned itmaybe for a childs  camera but for the price

13768,5,this rice cooker cooks three cups of rice max but it doesnt use a standard measuring cup you have to measure the rice with the cup included or the machine wont cook the rice right and if you plan to make the max rice this machine can hold you can forget about steaming anything in it because there will be no room also the steamer insert for this cooker is not included however it makes perfect consistent rice that i cant do on the stove as quickly as this machine the only thing i wish this machine has that other zojirushi machines have is a keep warm setting once it finishes cooking thats it you better hope you get to the rice before it gets cold i got this because it is better than any dash brand cookers in terms of longevity i cook rice almost daily and this machine has not quit out on me unlike my dash brand one that broke after a month if you want a budget friendly long lasting machine until you can get a bigger rice cooker this machine is perfect however if you are trying to cook for a family this cooker is too small youll want to get the bigger option even if just a cup moresmaller than i expected
522,1,this camera stopped working about two months after it came only got one real use out of itno
222,1,arrived with a mangled box scratched view finder screen and the box had been thrown at my door not impressed the listing also states youll receive two  memory cards that were not found in the box touch screen doesnt work 
3554,1,i bought this a little over a month ago for the trip im now on after a week of good use it now wont turn on having gone through the troubleshooting it appears the battery is dead but amazons policy is this product is not eligible for a return or replacement so they have washed their hands of it i will tell everyone to steer clear of gopro whenever possibleterrible defective and wont allow returns
14283,5,i have purchased  of these rice cookers i think that confirms my  star ratingbest rice cooker
6646,2,so far after the unboxing i was unable to find the second extra battery other than that everything looks goodjust got it missing item
4739,1,poor qualitykeeps freezing and breaking after few use
10488,4,does rice cooking very wellreheating rice not goodrice cooker
8580,1,this camera was a joke the quality really wasnt great i really struggled to get it to focus the ring light idea was awesome but my items are in plastic sleeves or acrylic cases or have metal surface the ring light created a reflective surface i ended up returning minei returned mine
3579,1,would not connect to wifiwasted my time
923,2,and the sound is terrible with and without the mic flimsy flip screen and iffy buttonsi am very disappointed returning as soon as possiblenot worth it
14021,4,i cook mostly everyday of the week and this cut my cooking time in half i love the rice cooker easy to use 
2545,1,my daughter absolutely loved this camera shed take it everywhere she went and it was a great purchase i got it for her for christmas  but around about march  the camera stopped holding charge so now its just been sitting on a shelf because she cant use it and i dont want to spend the money to buy a new one all over again i was hoping shed be able to enjoy this for much longer than a few monthsbattery wont hold a charge
8178,1,wow what a disappointment about  years ago i was sponsored by drift and had a great experience with the quality and ease of use with these cameras you now have to use the app to see what youre looking at which is fine if the app worked or if they had a customer service department but apparently they have neither could have used the cash to start a fire insteadapp doesnt work cant see what youre filming  junk
11233,2,this is a cute rice cooker but its most definitely not a  cup cooker its only  cups maybe  i purchased it because i needed a  cup my advice find a local asian market and purchase a cooker from therefalse information
5064,1,everything is ok with the camera and accessories but i ordered grey and it arrived white just the last color i wanted because i travel a lot and the white camera will look terrible in a few monthswrong color
2711,1,not true colors colors distorted grass looked pink pink shirts were redtrue colors
9022,1,dont waste your money on this camerastop
5512,1,ive had this over a year it has the worst focus ive ever experienced so many fake positive reviews about this camera here because very few of these raving reviews mention the horrible focus in their cons list no question the lack of focus must be at the top of any cons list ive missed thousands of shots because the lense wants to refocus every single shot even after ive locked in a focal range  target to be focused on like someone else here said this is a toy buy it if you have  to blow if you have lots of spare time to waste waiting for it to refocus  refocus  refocus  refocus if you dont really care about getting that shot because youll be disappointed a  times otherwise its not worth the frustration its only a toy that zooms out far but will fail to focus on your subject  of the time  will drive you nuts if you actually want to take a real picture  not waste your timeworst focus ive ever experienced this is a toy
687,2,only takes  picture then says its full  not sure if i got a bad cardsd card didnt work
16955,4,i love to use it with a easy handling and the white color of this kooker looks very well with my kitchen itemslooks very nice
7134,1,the album is damaged it has a hole all the way through the cover and also the first  pages are damaged as well i need to be reimbursed or a new one needs to be sentvery upset
2601,1,for some odd reason it didnt work right away you had to take the film out and put it back in multiple times before you could get a picture and it wasted the first picture every time so i wasted a lot of film trying to use thiswaste of film
4681,2,the main body of the device hinder the type c plug to be inserted and stay in my samsung note  slot with or without protective covertype c plug does not function
11928,5,this is our  zojirushi rice maker my daughter took off with the original when she left for college great machine not cheap but you get what you paid for really great product from a manufacturer that takes pride in their productsawsome rice maker  none better
8182,2,nice design poor execution i tried several settings several micro sd cards could not get it to record more than  clips at a time no matter what length recording timenot for me
13786,4,"ive only used it for making jazmine rice it cooks really good but in order to get the very good rice you need to use a little bit less water than what the instructions statei cant give this five stars since ive yet to use it for a pot roast but the machine is compact and easy to useless is better"
7872,2,i sent back after all my pics had a very orangeyellow tint i will stick to a regular size photo printerhorrible colors
6521,2,after  months of occasional use the battery life has become so bad that i cant record a  minute video great to start but the battery fades fast
14287,5,"my last rice cook lasted eight years until the non stick coating started falling out of the bowl which meant i needed to buy a new onethis one is different but also the same its a bit smaller which im fine with but the controls are almost exactly the same theyre portrayed differently but all the options are there you want porridge brown rice white rice soup etc its on the menu literallythe bowl is lightweight and probably aluminum with a non stick coating and the rice cook housing is plastic this isnt a high end model but with most appliances being disposable these days i dont need highend see my review on the high end keurig coffee maker i wrotei would put this in the cheap and cheerful category it does what it is intended to do excellent rice"
2972,1,wack ahh over a year old filmexpired film do not buy
9468,5,i dont routinely use small appliances because i dont like them sitting on on my countertops and theyre a hassle to store them away after having rice at a friends home cooked in this cooker i realized how much better it was than the instant rice i had been preparing for years i ordered one of these and have been so pleased very easy to use easy to clean lightweight easy to store and makes amazing rice i highly recommendso easy
11063,4,unit is very easy to operate it also cooks rice perfectly if you leave it long enough you get some nice browning on the bottom of the rice also cooks soups nicely if you are someone who likes nofuss instant ramensimplicity  results
8543,2,image quality is good and i like the classic design however the battery charger i got is not compatible with the us i wish the seller includes that information on the website now i have to look for another chargercharger i got isnt for us
2818,1,the camera we ordered came and it did not match the color on the box did not include all the batteries and accessories and did not turn on after charging it had scratches on the camera and basically looked like it was a returned item that was already used the company did send another one when we requested a replacement the problem was that the new came and didnt work either it was a new camera and looked like it should work but after charging fully per the directions there was still no functionality we decided to send it back for a refund and try a different companycamera was a damaged return
3999,1,poctures turned out very dark even when using extra lighting buttonvery disappointed
4300,2,this was not what i was expecting from the pictures of this product it looked like the bag was big enough to hold a camera and several lensif you keep you lens on your camera it barely fits if you had longer lens it would be difficult to fit them in this bag along with your camera it also appeared as if this bag would sling over your shoulder and make it easier to quickly grab and change lens however i can not see where you could open this bag while its over your shoulder without the contents falling outi have never recieved a bad product from this company before but this bag is a disappointment for me personally i wish i would have skipped this item and got the nikon bagdisappointed
3018,2,quality of pictures is really badwouldnt purchase again
124,1,this camera lasted two weeks only and the battery stopped charging it was making decent photos though ive tried different chargers with zero effecti would love to return it but we accidentally disposed the boxtwo weeks and dead
1591,1,bought this for my daughter to take on an overseas trip camera sensor is awful for any indoor setting and very few of her pictures at museums and other cultural attractions are even passable as a decent photo most are blurry autofocus is dreadful and dim somehow they managed to make a camera with no flash do not buy this product unless you need a prop for a scene you are photographing with a real cameracheap camera will ruin your memories
13765,5,this rice cooker is easy to use and has many features you can cook other things besides rice like quinoa and oatmealmultiple features
6910,2,though i truly love polaroid cameras and being able to get a tangible photographs i have to say after owning this camera for a little over a year i am overall disappointed with this camera and brandive owned three of these in the last year first one i got was faulty straight out of the box  something was wrong mechanically so it could not grab the fujifilm inside the camera so had to return it for a useable one second one broke due to a faulty strap and the camera did not survive the fall luckily i had bought a square trade warranty so was able to get a replacement camera knowing not to trust the strap i was extra precautious with the third camera so it would not break despite doing this after a few months the camera only takes blurry photos no matter how farclose i am to the object and yes i have made sure to clean the lens and the framing of the photos is always off compared to what i am looking at through the viewfinder the incorrect framing and blurry issues i am facing now were not an issue when i initially got the camera so im pretty disappointed that just by using the camera for a few months that it is now unusablewhen the camera was actually working i very much enjoyed it loved the quality of photos and loved being able to have an actual photograph after taking a photo but due to multiple issues i cannot recommend this product since it simply only lasts a few months before breakingif you are to buy one definitely be sure to buy a warrantythough i truly love polaroid cameras and being able to get a tangible 
6445,2,instruction to use the adapter is not clear and hard to figure out the battery life is short about  minutes pictures on the screen is not very clearbut on your tv it clearthin battery life
6359,2,first of all the image quality is really low the sound quality sucks there is no bluetooth wifi so underwater use means you have to wait until the camera is back in your hands to view it the micro card slot on mine was misaligned so the card could be inserted so that it falls into the camera the only way to get it out was to take it apart i will say the accessories were good so my purchase of a better  camera will also fit themskip this purchase
7731,1,this was meant to be a valentines day present for my grandson but i was so embarrassed when he opened the package to see this cheap plastic toy instead of a sturdy well made camera he could easily learn to use to take decent quality photosthis has to be one of the worst amazon purchases ive ever made the instruction book was worthless even the lanyard was impossible to attach definitely returning this little hunk of junkwhat a disappointment
8554,1,us buyers beware camera comes with battery charger that will not work in the united states unless you buy an additional adapter there was no information in the description to indicate that it was a nonus model amazon was unable to assure me that an adapter would fit the camera so i am returning it i am very disappointed as the camera was a christmas gift for my daughter i had purchased film case and album to go with the camera sadly i must return all of iti am very disappointed as the camera was a christmas gift for my 
7254,2,the unfortunate thing is that i cant provide a proper review as it didnt come with a battery i was wondering why it wasnt powering on for the longest time only to look inside and find there was no power source what sort of camera doesnt include the battery came with everything else and is in excellent condition sad i have to go out of my way to purchase a rechargeable battery separately before i can even use the thingdidnt come with a battery
6741,1,i cant believe all the  star reviews the dividers on this bag are awful they are so weak that camera equipment ends up banging into each other the velcro started ripping away from the dividers within weeks brevite doesnt respond to warranty claims i have a feeling all the positive reviews are from influencers who are offered a kickback from the companyfalling apart
6647,1,one of the batteries is defective and wont charge the process is annoying i just want another batterybad battery
6505,2,the light seemingly cannot be charged while using it or run off of wall power so it shuts off after like an hour and must be charged i purchased this to provide better lighting while im on video calls which it wont work for since it dies after my first meetingdoes not work as a video call light
8928,1,well i have now had plenty of practice trying to take pictures on this camera i really dont like it at all it is very hard to use the display screen shows a very light picture after taking one it throws me way off the ocean pictures were awful i had my i phone and ended up taking all my pictures with it sad for many years i had great pictures of the ocean and trips and this year most likely my last year to visit the ocean i had the least quality pictures a lot of money for nothingthere are a lot of setting practice if you want to use anything but the automatic setting
2281,1,everything about it was great easy to use good photos plugged it in to charge and now wont come on was i not supposed to do that gonna try and get new batteries to hopefully get back on but stopped working half way through my vacationused for three days now wont turn on
464,1,sim card isnt includedwthreally
8290,1,this came with a broken lens so when my granddaughter opened it christmas morning she couldnt play with it the box was not damaged in any wayso disappointedcame broken
8824,1,pictures are dark and take forever to developpictures are dark and take forever to develop
3668,1,was not easy to use poor quality i used more film trying to fix it then to take pictures do not buy it waste moneyit doesnt work it when my birthday party
1824,1,ive watched endless youtube videos mine just doesnt seem to work my friends that have all said theres doesnt do what mine does when it finally prints a photo they all come out white like the whole picture is white and the majority of the time it wont take the photodoesnt work
1818,1,was very excited for this camera and started using it right away at  it worked every time however more than  the time i go to capture a picture perfect moment expecting the camera to work and it doesnt little light on it just blinks and i dont get the picture hence missing the moment very frustrating camera i suggest not purchasing this camera and purchase one that is reliablecamera only works half the time
2615,1,my bundle only came with  packages of filmdoesnt come with everything in picture
6746,2,for some reason the ink is not laying down correctly on these paper rolls i think we should have ordered the official paper from fujiink doesnt print well on paper
6555,2,if you have apple do not buy this camera i really wanted to like this camera it is a nice quality camera and takes pretty good pictures it will not pair with apple products it will not work with iphones no matter what they say i plugged the usb cord into my computer and it didnt even recognize it the only way to get my pictures off my camera and onto my computer was to take the sd card out of the camera which is not easy the four aa batteries are spring loaded so you have to be careful when you open it or they go flying everywhere not so great when you want to change the sd card i felt like i was going to break it every time i tried to open itit comes with a quick start guide which will get you started but doesnt explain all of the different features if you are a beginner or need a refresher like me you might find all the different shooting options confusingi did like that the display screen is adjustable very helpful when taking pictures at different angles it takes nice pictures i did try to take some sports pictures and it seemed to have a hard time focusing i wish it had a shutteraperture setting like my old  overall im disappointed in nikon and will probably try a different brand i wish i had read more reviews before i bought this camera i have bought nikon cameras for years but this one stinks i might work great if you have a different smart phone but it didnt work for me check out their snapbridge app before you buydoes not work with apple
8454,1,in all lighting i could not get a clear picture this film and the camera are junkpicture quality is horrible
10045,5,very easy to useawesome
3910,2,when i added a new film packet it did not change from s back to  doesnt change to  after i add new film
2493,1,the camera feels fragile like a plastic toy in your hand pics were grainy cant imagine any flogger taking this outdoorsstopped working after  weeksi returned itmaybe for a childs  camera
8073,1,the now plus bleaches out about  of every  photos i take i know the film im using is good because i own both the now plus and the one step plus which is the previous years model and the one step plus exposures look consistently great the point of this camera for me is to be able to take spontaneous candid shots and i cant do that with such a high failure rate would rlnot recommend for othersexposures arent reliable
7534,1,i thought id try this out because of some positive reviews well its crap this thing works when it wants to and the sound quality is total trash save yourself from this and just add a few bucks and get a goproya get what you pay for
13392,5,i love my beautiful rice cooker cooks rice perfectly and the rice doesnt stick to the pan however the steam is messy so prepare for a messy toplove love love
6276,1,i agree with many of the other reviews that the casing is flimsy and cheap and the hinges are rickety that is manageable if it is handled carefully but for  you would expect something a little more substantiala fatal shortcoming is the software and documentation virtually no documentation came with the device and the online documentation was overly complex and confusing there were about  or ten versions of the software that could be downloaded and it takes a long time to figure it out even then you are not sure there were many many many pages of legal documentation warnings and disclaimers the instructions for installing were literally only four lines long someone wrote that the menus were intuitive i would say they are incomprehensible i dont know if it ever got itself integrated into photoshop i do know when you try to use it it gives you no idea what it is doing it finished you dont know if the setting have been applied to the photo whether it made a separate copy you dont know where the edited files are stowed or even if it did anything the conventions used do not seem to follow standard window conventions the online website is all marketing and legal support info virtually nonexistent i would like to give it a  but have to rate it a one star since i havent got anything out of it yetdoesnt work documentation is lousy
4248,1,it is very cheap not worth the money image quality poor blurry maybe we got a dudthis camera was so difficult to work with
8309,1,camera is great for toddler but received the item with box open which kinda feels used and no sd card which tells me its definitely usedpackage open and no sd card  daughter loves the camera but now have to order micro sd card
1011,1,photos were blurry camera came without a memory card so extra purchase for memory card was a waste of money its a low quality chinese slave labor product in my opinion not even suitable for a beginner my flip top phone takes better pictures than this camera did save your money for something better  mp very little difference with  mp shots the quality of the camera determines the beauty of the pictures not the marketing of the product a cheap camera such as this one takes bad pictures do you understand that usually you get what you pay for and this is  camera it shoots lousy pictures maybe the camera was defective but the pictures were horrible one shot fits all deceptive advertisementreturned after taking many shots at night and day of flat and still  d settings all garbage i was so disappointed with this product i had to come down hard on it i might recommend for your toddler if you have one they might try to chew on it bad camera boss steer clear my brothers and sisters junkfull crap camera
8295,1,it was a cute camera the camera part pulls up but wont actually snap the photos no its not full it literally just wont take photosstopped taking pictures after a month
2144,2,i took the studio as im an aspiring photograph and i suggested this box would be great to start ecommerce businessthe problem started from the  first of all when you unfold the box there is a huge crevice left at the background so you are suppose to remove it in the software editing programyou can check the same problem with other  second  it is hard to get different angles to get a quality image of the product also the box is pretty small and it limits drastically the size of any product i planned differently when i took  you cant control the lights  at all which is just terrible for any  and the last but not least  after a month the lamps started to turn off  after  minutes sometimes it happens sometimes not but it makes the business very unpredictableafter a month of work i chose to build my own studio where i can control all the lights and the sizes of the product and dont have to worry about installed lamps in the box which i dont have any control overim sending the box backdefect product  find something else
10509,5,it is extremely useful despite how tiny it is and i do mean like really tiny lol but it works for a single person household to have a large portion holds a little more than a cup of dried rice of rice at a time i also love the pinksuch a great rice cooker
6441,1,the camera shipped and arrived on time and looks just like advertised however when i finally was about to use it i peeled off the protective sticker which revealed scratches on the lens apparently the thing shipped from the manufacturer with a scratched lens or at least someone slapped the protective sticker on top of a scratched lensunacceptable cant trust this manufacturer evidentlycame with scratched lens under the protective clear sticker
8401,1,camera didnt work so paper wasnt usefuldont work unless you have a working camera
8169,1,i heard this brand is the best but it never showed up so had to get a refund as far as rating not a bad thing that they where all sold outcould be good
9306,1,i live alone and often start with  cup of dry rice on the stove for a meal i bought this thinking it would make my life easier too little water you get very dry rice too much water the rice sticks to the bottom i thought i just needed to learn the optimal mix but in the middle you just get dry rice that sticks to the bottom it does not work with brown basmati rice it does not work with white sushi rice it does a nice job with quinoa but i barely have space for a dedicated rice cooker i do not need a dedicated quinoa cookernot for cooking rice
1120,1,soon as i got the camera put the memory card in it says full went on my computer connected the camera and nothing is literally on the camera waste of money picture quality is trash now im in the middle of returning it back to amazonmemory card came full
999,2,the usb was not right and not for this camera it was way too big and wouldnt fit and after  photos the screen messed up completelynot the right charger and broken screen
4911,1,installed partially charged battery and micro sd card looked good but activating zoom button causes an error message lens obstruction restart there is no lens cap or anything else that could obstruct lens restarted several times same problem immediately returningdefective out of box
14772,5,i bought this brand by recommendation and was told cuckoo makes great rice better than the restaurant well i love this cooker so far ive only used it for white rice but the clean up is easy and it keeps the leftovers warm and perfect for dayshighly recommend cuckoo
910,1,there doesnt appear to be anyway to monitor volume levels when recording there is no onscreen levle indicators nor knobs to adjust volume level this means i have no way to know and control if audio is to loud and distorting additionally there is no way to connect a headset to listen to the recorded audio with any fidelity you can listen through the small integrated speaker but you cant tell if sounds is good to soft to louddistorted the only option is to remove sd cardvery disappointedaudio recording lacks
5377,1,my camera came opened no film and would not turn on i switched the batteries and still nothing the camera box was opened and the camera was clearly useddidnt work
6558,1,i wanted an easy point and click that provided more options than the camera on my phone convinced by the  reviews i expected something that would deliver ease of use and highquality photos but was extremely disappointed first there is a ridiculous delay when shooting that makes the photos turn out horribly you miss shots and your subject is just sitting there waiting second the flash makes every photo look crazy but you cant shoot in certain lighting without it third the photo clarity is atrocious possibly because of the delay when shooting but none of them come out clear the only time the photos looked okay was when shooting outside and in the exact right light inside the photos were terrible no matter what mode i was shooting in finally the bluetooth functionality was impossible to make work no matter how many ways i tried i couldnt connect it overall a disappointing product ill either go back to using canon or stick with my phoneshockingly bad camera
8143,1,the camera had a decent battery life they claim  hours but i got around   on average that was until the battery just stopped charging  months into owning it it still works if its plugged in which means my helmet cam is now a handlebar cami also had issues keeping it in the poorly named car mode where it automatically rolls over recording of the video even with regular charging and even using it plugged in the camera would eventually go out of this mode and the very fiddly and unreliable phone app is not always easy to use on the side of the road when youre trying to get your camera running againeven if you can take a very short product life and annoying ui in stride the very poor image quality should be enough to keep you away you wont see anything besides headlights at night and during the day glare will often wash out the screen license plates of cars were readable in the daytime to about  feet   meters in the highest resolution available about   meters in the dark depending on how good the cars license plate lighting isfar worse picture quality than a gopro  non replaceable battery dies in  months
8033,1,bought this item as a gift and what they received was a used chipped printer with no cable and no manual this product was not listed as a used item total rip offrip off
4564,1,bought  in april for family vacation and used them the entire week they sat in the closet for  months and now they wont hold a charge fun cameras but not worth itgood but only lasted a week
8924,2,i think the camera is great for the price i just didnt like the pictures i felt my phone could take the same quality maybe im hoping for too muchnot the quality i was hoping for
9069,1,this would have been a good deal if the film wasnt already damaged all photos are coming out with streaksnot good
5067,1,i bought this camera to take photos on vacation and i was so disappointed i bought it because of the reviews only to find out they are a little its hard to download the pics the quality is not the best after i take a pic i cant move the camera for about  seconds or the pictures will come not worst to see the pics you have to download an app and that app is not the best eitheri am very disappointed and would try to get my money back i used it for like  pics and changed toy phone instead thats how bad it waslow quality on pictures
6394,2,picture quality suckstrash
7210,1,purchased this piece of crap strap as a gift this was sent to me this morning one use the strap broke this wasnt user error the user is a professional terrible save yourself the tears do not buy this item refund immediatelystrap sucks
5720,2,to use the rainbow border zink paper you have to install de update of the camera so you need the a macro sd card and to follow the steps on the polaroid website that appears in the package of the zink paper for the first package i made the mistake of not installing the update and no border appeard in color but before i did the update and followed the steps it still didnt a colored border i even did the update several times tried with and without the border and still no color border i am very dissapointed with the product because its more expensive than the conventional paper and behaved exactly the sameto use the rainbow border zink paper you have to 
9011,1,product was used and box was not in original seal and was open returned itemproduct was in open box
4866,1,liked nothingwas to big not what i thought
3259,1,cheap not even worth the money for a kids cameracheap not even worth the money for a kids camera
9476,5,i really liked this rice cooking device just in  minutes rice is ready and i enjoy cooking with this small rice cooker it saves my time and cooks very well so the rice is not sticky but very deliciousfast help
5641,1,just a cheap camera i bought it hoping it would be better than my phone notpoor quality
249,1,i bought this camera for business took a few photos noticed that the photo quality was terrible but i was called away on a pandemic emergency had to leave state to go help family left the camera at home so couldnt return it when i arrived back home months later picked up the camera took some photos they were garbage husband spent two days on research and fiddling with the camera and declared it the worst piece of junk he has ever seen so for us this was like throwing away  i will never buy a panasonic product again i got so screwed unusable buyer beware my phone takes better pictures than this a polaroid is better than this old grainy photos from the  is better than thisdo not buy  straight in the trash
6491,1,first it was ok brightness was not on top but it it was ok controls was easybut suddenly few months later item stopped working i dont know it is battery related issue or not but at least light doesnt turn on anymorestopped working
7751,2,the instructions and buttons are confusing especially for kids to understand my son lost interest real quick when had a hard time remembering which buttons to usehard for kids
3107,1,the photos dont work the cartridge is so messed up and indented i didnt notice or try to use them until until past the return date so im stuck with them very disappointedall photos are completely messed up
7784,1,its supposed to be durable but the display broke after falling on carpet the camera itself is pretty chinsy and was pretty difficult to maneuver between the different featuresnot worth the price
8704,1,stay away terrible camera will not operate correctly tried to return and would not allow a replacement or customer assistancedo not buy terrible camera will not operate correctly
2265,1,my first one lasted  years i was pleased with that considering the tremendous use i got from it my second lasted a year that was very disappointing but since it still met all my requirements namely the use of aa batteries i cautiously bought another that one lasted a month im not sure what ill buy next but it wont be one of thesethese cameras arent even made by kodak i learned that when trying to get refundrepair or replacement on this one the number you dial will feature an automated recording which asks personal questions press  if youre over the age of  answer it and you will be spammed with offers on various thingsits a neat scam build low quality cameras customer service line is automated and attempts to get personal info from you this info is then sold person with broken camera now receives more spam but no helpbuyer bewareunreliable
7384,1,not at all what i expected returned it for s refund 
2825,1,bought this for a trip but unfortunately when i went to use it already on the trip at this point the cameras screen glitched out and suddenly appeared cracked but there is not actual visible damage to the screen so disappointed that i was unable to take photos on my trip another disappointing aspect of this camera is that there is no lens cover or shutter thankfully i suppose i didnt have to worry about that very disappointing
599,1,my son only took about  pictures before the screen broke he was very sad and disappointed he asked me if all cameras are this fragile since this is marketed as a kids camera it needs to be a little more rugged i made him read the entire instruction manual before he could use it the picture quality is ok kind of like an old cell phonebroke way too easily
4061,1, disappointed disappointed disappointed watch a video review of product online says can use external hard drive as shared recording recording live video and also recording in the cloud personally i spent a bit of money that i shouldnt have without doing research unit is easy enough to set up but battery life is very short no way to output to television via usb as it said in videocant record to usb drive from base station those features were reserved for the pro versions updatesalso camera will record  recordings to the cloud not to exceed  unless you want to fork out  a year for subscription for more or  for even more totally disappointed in free subscription features guess its another case of not reading the items description and researching thoroughly before investing in it but over all if rating camera and connectivity to base station on another review i would give it a three star rating but overall just not the case if you really want to have all the bells and whistles buy the pro version with the newer base station and more features such as output to an external drive and possibly a television and even talking through the camera too on the pro version really dont know what i was expecting with this first edition for the money i tell you what i have a  dollar security system that i cannot use because i live in an apartment complex that you can drill wire holesthus tried this and like i said  i suppose you get what you pay for and actually use caution ask questions and do research that way there is no surprisesreally sux to live in apartments where you cant do what you are use to and have to do things differentlyi suppose if you are happy with what i said in my review about my options and my experience then you should be fineupdate after careful consideration and all consideredfor the money you cant beat it easy installation ease of use excellent quality camera also love the motion sensor feature works wonderful great range on wireless hookup and thinking of getting a few more of these cameras for other areas i still wish for the other features and a little disappointed but decided the video downloading feature to your device is excellent also the zoom feature and everything considered decided to give it five stars it to me is worth the money definitely great value for everything and funyet another update disappointed againcamera is not waterproof wife was watering plants last night and it got a little wet when she just splashed the camera from light spray and water got inside the lense causing a spot on the inside that cannot be removed blocking the left side of the picture with water spot also today it started shuddering in the recording like a skipping dvd i am just put out and so disappointed altogether should have known the thrills wouldnt last there is an old saying if its too good to be true then it probably is just frustrated and so disappointedand netgear with years and years of experience cant even live up to their quality the name has stood for many years just sick at heart and out the money i paid for this unit guess i should see if my apartment complex would give me permission to put my  dollar unit in and hardwire expensive cameras that are truly weather resistant and work in color perfectly in all weather conditions and are waterprooflive and learnanother case of not reading enough or researching enough my fault but it is what it says  just not what i wanted
2250,1,the camera quality is really bad dont get itdont buy
6798,2,i purchased this for my mother i thought it would be easy enough for her to use without having to spend a lot of time trying to show her we went through  sets of batteries before we figured out that it doesnt time out and turn itself off i have had many digital cameras throughout the years and never had one that didnt turn itself off i had bought one for my granddaughter for christmas and found out she had the same problemdisappointment
4734,1,it was coolat firstonly printed a couple dozen pics now it prints a smudge gave it to my daughter for xmas its march and wont print a thinginklessno pic
5777,2,i had done soooo much research for an easy but high quality camera i am so sick of taking pictures of my family on my phone and having the quality really lack i am by no means a professional photographer just a mom who wants nice photos of the familyi finally decided on this canon vs its old model i thought i would like that it had the mobile device connect button i thought this would make it super easy to upload and share my photoswell it definitely takes great photos overall it is easy to set up and use the zoom works amazingly well point and shoot with auto focus was so nice and user friendlywhat i hated was the mobile device connect button upload feature you can either upload to your phone or your computer if your internet speed isnt ultra fast or if you have more than  photos you will be waiting a long time for them to upload i waited  hours for  photos to upload i had over  photos from an event i wanted uploaded and i just couldnt get it to upload fast enough i ended up returning the camera because it doesnt even have an option with a cord to upload directly to your computertakes forever to upload photos
7774,1,extremely disappointed terrible picture quality display is grainy but accurate since thats what the pictures look likegave it to my daughter for her birthday feel like an bad dad now sorry little girlbleeping dog bleep camera do not buy

8077,1,we compared photos from my polaroid and my friends instax camera in the same place and hers are so much better and brighter it seems like there might be something wrong with my camera because all photos come off too darkvery dark photos no matter the exposure
784,1,opened the cover to insert the battery cover fell off inserted sd card got card error message on the screen reinsert it  times tried different sd card no availtried to contact the company at the email address given no response sending it back and demanding a refundcheap junk

5825,2,i just received this camera yesterday i ordered it over  weeks ago in this box was camera strap battery with charger that was it there was not a booklet or a warranty or any paperwork for that matter it did not have even the memory card i am sending this back and buying one in the store probably for the same price very disappointedvery disappointed
851,1,currently after one month the item isnt working properly  unfortunately i missed the return date has passed i do believe i have limited warranty and did purchase some additional coverage so i need to see how this will workitem not working its taking pictures but not developing
14791,1,"ive been using this rice cooker for less than a year total approx  times a week for  cups of rice for the majority of the time the rice has been great and perfectly texturedthis past week the rice started getting hardburnt on the bottom i looked at all my settings and i had it as   and  according to the manuals online i set  and  which should only impact the soaking time before the cookingthis last time i used it the rice cooker had difficulty opening and it turns out the rice cooker was completely melted i had to break some of the plastic just to take the lid out it looks like some electrical or mechanical failure as i dont think any rice cooker should be getting hot enough to melt plastic normally super disappointingrice cooker started to burn rice and melted on last use"
8345,2,was so excited to buy this after arrival i was disappointed at hows difficult the use of this camera is the quality with included lenses is trash just go to best buy and get something bettercould be better
6996,1,i got a lemon camera batteries that it came with dont workbought new batteries only one picture came out flash doesnt work cant return it because it was a wedding gift sad gift but bride and groom will give it to their kid to play with so basically i bought them an expensive toy oh well better luck next time for me dont buy if you buy it may be a  chance you will actually get a good cameradoesnt work
4384,1,weve had this frame for a while and the quality was good however we just had a huge problem with it and will no longer be using it we had purchased this for my motherinlaw and she enjoyed it however when her internet connection settings changed it was offline for a while when i got it reconnected to the internet it suddenly deleted all of the pictures on the frame and in the account with no warning whatsoever i immediately contacted customer support and was told the account was broken or its content corrupted that is why so it was not working anymore and nothing could be done to retrieve the pictures we spend a lot of time collecting pictures for the frame over the years and all that is lost through no fault on our part i wont risk that happening again and will instead start over with an aura frame which is way easier to use anyway hope this wont happen to youbeware  might suddenly delete all pictures
8773,1,non of my pictures came outcamera doesnt work
1517,2,as far as cameras go its functional but not what id recommend for anyone that is a content creator got this camera hoping that it would be better than my logitech webcam and other than being portable thats the only thing this camera has against my webcam the focus and the amount of detail it can capture with items up close is disgraceful no matter how hard it tries to focus the image is always blurry the description says it can do  quality but thats a blatant lie the imagevideowebcam quality is a little above  but no where near  dont know if this is typical for all cameras but the video file it exports is avi but cant be watched on windows  computers without being converted to a  file type first overall not very happy with the cameratypical knock off
9133,1,didnt develop properlydefective
11064,5,"i bought this rice cooker in september of  and ran it in to the ground i used at least at least  times per week of the time i just cooked rice i think ive used the steam function maybe once or twice for cooking rice its great just make sure to wash your rice beforeit has stopped working now whenever i try to press the lever down to cook the rice it wont click in place but for only  i definitely got my moneys worthim not sure about the average longevity of a rice cooker or how long one is supposed to last but this one got me through college and then some  for less than  thats a win in my bookbest  i ever spent"
7658,1,fraudulent add says product comes with film it does not very misleading and will not order from this carrier againfraudulent
3952,2,i wanted to love this the first picture came out great but the rest have come out black and the flash wont work ive tried turning the dial to every setting and no differenceblack photos

6005,1,everything is okay touchscreen is awful the back screen stopped working after one week 
242,1,i have been trying to return this camera since i got it feb  and no luck the eye part of the camera was falling off and the battery to the camera wont charge i even tried to sell it on facebook marketplace and no one will buy it because of the issues and its not worth the price you can get a iphone with better capabilities im stuck with camera and not even amazon will refund me my  because it was a used like new camera that was a lie i need my money back and take this trash camera my iphone  has a better picture then this cameraplease dont buy
7410,2,all pictures come out blurry as if they are being take while someone is moving no matter how still you are pictures come out very dark in indoor lighting never truly satisfied with any of the pictures i have takentheres better out there the instax mini does a better job 
3511,1,very poor build quality camera feels very cheap enclosed memory card did not work after  hour of use the pictures were upside down and despite having our own high speed sd card in the camera not every picture was saved we just got a black screen when reviewing them the few pictures we did take and that were successfully recorded on the card were over exposed and very noisy we will be returning this camera immediately i guess you get what you pay forvery cheap camera that takes pictures upside down
10472,5,perfect size for me being single i made rolled oats for breakfast and it was good ill be using it for rice later today and have no doubt it will make perfect rice im a tractor trailer driver so ill be using this on the road as well as at home this way i can eat healthier by cooking fresh easy to clean also i recommend it nice productexcellent
7631,2,the tripod broke off as i was installing it and tightening it perhaps it was just unlucky but it didnt feel like good quality for something to happen right out of the boxotherwise lights were good nice and bright 
3278,1,the autofocus is really hinkydoesnt find the object very fast like my other does goes in and out and is slooooooow i cant afford a new one but i wouldnt buy this again  im using a  and doesnt find focus object quickly
3494,2,charging port broke in a week after getting it huge bummerbroke within a week
4114,1,update  this is really a total piece of junk dont get me wrong the camera takes a good picture both day and night and the wireless works fine the problem is the motion sensor sucks i have tried about  different locations  higher lower right left more toward the street facing the driveway etc etc and at each position ive adjusted the angle trying up down right left etc no matter where i put it it does not pick up a person until they are within a few feet so what you get is less than  sec of kinda the person and then  secs of the top of their head or back totally worthless right now with motion sensing set to max im getting the mail truck driving by cars driving by but no people until it is too late to see a face and without a face what good is it as a security camera ive thought of putting it real low like head high or even doorbell high but that just invites getting it taken i guess id at least get a picture of who took itbottom line it sucks save your moneyokay i was really looking forward to this arlo camera directions say to mount over  ft high well when i did that all i got was the tops of heads never really noticed but most people not regular visitors look down to make sure they dont trip on something haha add the really cold weather scarfs and hats and my own mother wouldnt have recognized me at the door oh and that high up and pointing down limits the range of the motion sensor im getting the last  feet or so of mostly tops of headsso ive played around and already moved it  times better but not something id want to rely on to catch a bad guyive gone lower but now im at a height where the baddie can just reach up and take it at least i can see who took ittomorrow im going to try some more locations good thing this is wirelessbottom line it sucks save your money
2054,2,the polaroid original is nothing but a cheap camera that relies on its builtup brand name to carry it through tough times i had the older version when i was a child and it worked every time flawlessly this newer version is but a shadow of the original and pales in comparision to its qualitypoor version
3839,1,the picture quality is super grainy there is no flash on this camera it is not user friendly do not recommend will be returningdont waste your time or money
7166,2,there are  reviews averaging  stars for this thing as of today unless altura has a similer wrist strap that amazon has unfortunately grouped with this one which doesnt just happen sometimes its amazons sop anywhoooo heres what i dont like about this  i thought it would be a quick on and off of the camera i definitely dont want to use this all of the time and thought id be able to pop it on and off nope you have to thread it through one side of your cameras clip things in order to make it snug to your wrist which takes more than a minute which is all im willing to commit to using a wrist strap it took me  minutes to get it on the camera even if its faster to get it off its too much time why cant they make a clip built into the strap that can clip on and off of the camera clips i mean it wouldve been so easy to do  i saw that one reviewer had written that he had trouble getting this thing off his hand and though i can see that being a problem as well im more afraid that its going to pop off my wrist and my cameras gonna fall off my hand i bought this thing because im getting some tendinitis or some muscle spasming in my camera forearm and i need to be able to loosen my grip on my camera at times just to let my arm relax maybe most purchasers of this thing only want it for the extra security but have no intention of letting the grip loosen if thats the case then this reason wont pertain to you if you as well bought this looking for some relief from constantly gripping your camera then this is a big one i mean the only things keeping the camera on my hand are the snap buttons snap fasteners that snap on the outside of your wrist the entire well being of my  camera im gonna trust to two button snaps not a chance again they couldve easily couldve used clips here but they  id agree with an earlier reviewer that when you start to take it off your wrist the plastic parts slam into your camerai mean it looks nice it even feels nice i really want to like it but its not a quick on and off of the camera like it should be and with the button snaps as the only line of defense to stop my camera just falling off of my hand if i were to not be gripping it tight  other people think its great or at least thats what theyll have you believe in which case grain of salt me and see if you like it thats itam i crazy not liking this thing
2475,1,very poor image quality sent it back cell phones are better than thispoor quality
2249,1,save your moneythis is not a  or even a good  camera
7392,2,i am big on using fujifilm instax cameras and this camera has the worst photo quality that i have ever seen they all come out super dark just like the rest of the reviews say do yourself a favor and just stay away if you use fujifilm instax cameras it is not the same picture quality as the other cameras i understand it looks cute and fun but this camera photo quality had huge flawsstay away 
471,2,incredibly disappointed in this camera i bought this one to replace my sony cybershot g that ive had for many years because it is getting worn and the mechanics are starting to fail this camera is the newer model of it so i was hoping for similar if not hopefully better quality this is not the case the resolution for my pictures are average and i feel like my iphone  can take better quality photos i am familiar with the settings on these cameras so i did tinker with the different modes but none of them lived up to my expectationsif this is your first camera and you have nothing to compare it to i think that you will find it very nice but if you are looking to upgrade do not buy this camera i returned it very soon after it arrived and i am looking into a new camera now two stars because it is still a decent camera for those that arent looking for anything too extravagantvery disappointed
3842,2,who sells a camera without a memory cardthere was no memory card
9368,5,i grew up using a rice cooker while the technology as ostensibly advanced the basic functionality hasnt really changed the moosum electric rice cooker works reliably and well i havent done any definitive tests but it seems like rice cooks faster in the moosum rice cooker than on the stovetop or in older rice cookers the rice comes out reliably well cooked i havent use the steamer basket but i have used the moosum to make quinoa as well as chicken and rice both turned out perfectly im very happy with the moosum the only complaint i have is that the included rice paddle is very thin and cheapexcellent rice cooker
2658,2,the camera is fine for a  year old biggest issue i have is the sd card it comes with sucks ive had issues with it since we got the camera my daughter would want to take pictures but it wouldnt work come to find out the sd card wasnt reading i would have to remove and insert it a few times for the camera to read it and take pictures again and now a little over a year later card wont read at all gotta buy a new one so all those pictures she took over the last year are gone except for a very little few the camera saves in its internal storage other then that the camera is fine for what it is picture quality isnt good but i didnt expect it to bethe sd card sucks
11116,5,works great i was skeptical because of the price so glad i chose this oneabsolutely love
8817,1,it was nice and small just right to go anywhere with itonly downfall was all the pictures would be darkpictures too blurry
11223,1,i have a small instant pot rice cooker but it takes so long to build pressure i thought maybe it was broken i bought this one as a replacement my rice is never cooked ive done brown rice that i let set all day in the cooker on delay that was fine but several times when i cooked the brown or white rice or came out not cookedno
3656,2,i have yet to take  good picture im not happy with this purchaseim ot so happy
6269,2,this particular camera does not take good pictures indoor ive tried different lighting and everything i can think of to get a clearer picture the instructions or lack of instructions are not thorough enough to teach you if youre not an experienced photographer this one is not recommendedcanon camera
3274,1,i bought the refurbishedbynilon  afs dx zoom  but the diaphram refused to stop down so it was useless to me i returned it to amazon the diaphram refused to stop down so it was useless to me
4337,2,it is not suitable for mirrorless cameras and not enough room for  lenses the straps are very low quality and makes it difficult to take your gears in and out without taking the bag off the shoulderi returned itpoor quality
4998,1, time i bought it it would not turn on i assumed i got a bad one so i returned it and got it replaced this  time the camera worked great but then after  months the camera stopped working it just wouldnt turn on please save your money and dont buy this camerapurchased twice both cameras stopped working
4898,1,the camera had already been set to the french language it was dusty and dirty the box was torn and missing items not happy at all returning aspnot happy
8949,1,a cheaper phone would take better pictures i really like this camera but i was impossible to take a clear and nice pictures again i compare to my phone and its like date and night and my phone is only a really cheap one and even like that take better picturespoor picture quality
11366,5,i love this small rice cooker its makes plenty for two people its really easy to useclean its very cute and the rice comes out perfect every time i love the keep warm feature i highly recommend this productgreat little cooker
1953,1,the set up on this camcorder was additionally tough since the manual is so short and lacking in detail that you end up with sort of a guided trial and error process then after that difficult process i turn on the camera to find that the image is upside down on the screen no remedy or discussion about image placement in the manualno  customer service chat room nothing youre on your own i tried amazons help line and chat with no response also the remote control did not work this is chinese garbage i feel stupid for ordering it i went to best buy tonight and bought a real camcorderonly reason it got  star is that amazon doesnt offer zero starts junk
754,1,the camera is incomplete because it is missing the memory cardincomplete product
260,1,i have been on youtube since  do not buy this camera after a year the led screen failed and i had to send it in to be fixed they claim that i had changed some function and that it was my fault yet when the camera came back the screen was brand new i had used this camera for a year i know how it workednow  months later and now this camera is failing to record video the insurance provided makes it hard to file a claim and wont respond to emails directly it looks like i spent  on complete garbagei wasted  on garbage
1121,1,the user interface is poor the instructional booklet didnt help autofocus was very slow zoom functioned but was not satisfactory for me battery life is not longquality of software
3217,1,no instructions and having a hard time figuring it out to connectokay
2839,1,arrived broken digital display malfunction and unfortunately we didnt know until after the return window had already closedarrived broken
5462,1,based on the reviews i bought this camera prior to a trip to china next time i buy a camera i will give myself plenty of time to figure out how to use it although ive owned dozens of canons and a few nikons without any mishapsbecause there is no public internet for the western world i couldnt even google instructions the first  photos i took were in a movie format  or  framesshot this meant i couldnt even post a photo or send one due to the gigantic size it was so frustratinghundreds of pictures of xian the terra cotta warriors the pandas in chengduall unsharable after almost  weeks of traveling we boarded a ship in hong kong with the internet and i was able to change the setting on the camera when i returned home i had to go through each picture and delete all but one frame a task that took a week now its too late to share photosand then last month i spent a month in australia and new zealand and i thought i could figure out how to use this camera howeverthere are so many bloomin buttons on the front of the camera that i would inadvertently touch one and suddenly my photos were in black and white im in the middle of hobbiton where the lord of the rings movies were shot and im trying to figure out how to change the setting back to color other buttons would change a filter so no photo was viewable or i was no longer able to film insidemy photos would almost be black thank goodness my husband had an old canon pands camera or i would have missed out on most of the indoor shotsits hard to believe that im the only person who has had a problem with this cameraall the reviews were glowing but its been a nightmare for me anyone want a used cameraas much as one can despise an inanimate object i despise this camera
8900,1,i tried to return to amazon but we are just barely beyond the allowed return period so cannot return i sent minolta an email and never got a response so much for their lousy customer service the battery was needing to be charge after  minutes of use each time so i left it on the charger for  hours and it still does the same thing i really feel like i got stuck with a previously returned faulty camera i would never buy a minolta camera again never i wish i would have purchased a canon or sony camera do not make the same mistake i madebattery will not hold any charge after just  days of usepretty sad
6926,2,this camera is much harder to use than initially thought photos shot even at what seemed to be the correct distance turned out blurry various features were not intuitive and in general the camera was much larger and bulkier to handlefurthermore to shoot macro or close up one must use an easy to misplace magnifying glass type lens that clips on to the front of the shutter this fell off several times and eventually required me to use a piece of string to affix to the camera strap when using this accessory you must also reframe the photo around a new focal point which makes sense based on the instructions but never resulted in a photo as intended most photos showed up incredibly dark and not very interesting spent at least two cartridges of film simply trying to achieve a single good shot and never really achieved that final thought a big disappointment for the price paid im sure you could take excellent pictures on this over time but if youre looking for something thats quick and easy this isnt itlooks are deceiving
3827,2,keep shoppingfeels cheap you have to take the battery out often to get it to work
5208,2,unfortunately my nephew is without a working camera as it no longer will charge the concept is great he loved the selfie lens it did have games which were not in the description which is a big battery drainstopped charging in a couple months
6260,1,i have had this cover for about   years now i have used it only twice the  time i got it out i was very disappointed the clear areas had turned very cloudy i was unable to see my camera buttons because visibility was so poor it also has a poorly designed lens sleeve in that even after tightening the sleeve onto the lens it comes loose constantly and became useless sad too since i was attempting shooting a heavy waterfall at yosemite national parkonly ok while brand new
6038,1,the product description and pictures show a camera with a  memory card and  zoom the camera comes with a  card and does not have the capability to zoomnot as advertised
2024,1,the camera takes horrible photos i have tried with the flash onwith the flash off in a well bright room i tried outside they are horrible quality i would have never purchased and wished i could return or try a different one i purchased for my elder parents christmas  such a disappointmenthorrible quality photos
987,2,disappointed in this camera unable to download images to my pc  instructions are complicated on using it in generalyou get what you pay for not much
492,1,i am furious i am a senior citizen living on an incredibly little budget but i bought this camera because i absolutely love photography yes it lasted throughout the warranty period but now it wont turn on yes fresh batteries the last super moon  is tonight im really really upsetthe camera is only about  mos old
8539,1,received the camera first thing i did was look through the viewfinder and noticed a dirty spot in the viewfinder which i cant seem to clean it upon further inspection the dirty spot was inside the viewfinder there was no way to get it out i was furious this was supposed to be a christmas gift for my daughter and she is going to be very upset we have to return this back to amazon unbelievableupdate got the replacement camera this one did not come with the wall plug that attaches to the charger now im unable to charge terriblethere was something inside the viewfinder
8879,1,i bought this sewing wireless and thinking oh okay its wifi nope im not going to keep playing with sd cards with all of the tech out there i am sure there is a wifi one im returning it it also feels super dang cheesy and the frame is super glossy so finger print magnetno wifi
7190,1,it worked ok for a second but its more annoying then helpfuli wish i could return it
4913,1,i bought this camera in april  for taking pictures while snorkeling the camera is hard to use in the water but takes okay pictures we are about to go on another trip in december  and the rechargeable battery wont hold a charge and the only place you can buy another one is on the kodak website for  is garbage and expensive to replace
17484,5,"just buy this rice cooker replace cuckoo   because the grains turn to brown color at the rear and bottomtoday i cook with this zojirushi selected menu  jasmine for mixed rice on the timer mode the mixed rice is comprised of jasmin rice red brown rice  pearl barley brown  brown lotus seeds with gaba in it the rice is wonderful aroma throuh the air is so goodany parts of rice is so soft  lotus seed is so fresh and full of texture not any sign of burning dark color this rice cooker is better than cuckoo in any detail especially the timer mode  the important for mixed rice  everybody should mix rice in another bowl  for prevent the damage of coated pot and cleaning the rice pour the rice in pot of rice cooker fill the water in the level as manual stir the rice in the same level  same horizontal line if you directly mix rice in the pot it will gradually scratch the pot day by day and turning to big jab and the rice will stick in the potthat isthe wonderful rice cooker"
2719,1,my  year old loved this it was easy for her to use and had so much fun with it but suddenly the screen would get fuzzy and stop working after  picture we tried doing resets and recharges on it but nothing seems to fix itstopped working
2021,1,waste of money doesnt work at all film never processed through the camera like it should camera turns on and does nothing huge waste of money on the camera and filmdoesnt work
8357,2,first the great these prints are way more detailed than you think they are a perfect size for a variety of uses the around  price point per print is not bad for a sticker they hold up on the inside of a book or a box well the kodak app is crazy easy to use and user friendlythe awfulthe last print of every batch is always messed up  discolored fuzzy too dark or otherwise just off after a new pack and the recalibration card youre good again until the last print these prints are absolutely not as water resistant or sealed as they claim they discolor almost immediately upon getting wet because of the printing process they cant hold up to much temperature change at all  ive put them on water bottles cups laptop desks headphone cases pill cases tile transpondersanything that feels any heat or cold will start peeing each ink layer off gradually until they just tear off to the touch leaving blank white rectangles i live someplace that gets every season so anything thats not untouched and in a shadow wears out gradually and anything i portable i take with me to the car or back yard peels as wellbasically anything that goes into your pocket it will strip every single layer of ink off one by one until its a blank piece of paper  with the most minor heat plus the friction of your pocket the stickers are hard to cut into shapes or otherwise alter  the nature of being a pile of ink layers makes it peel and discolor at the edges after being cutthe kodak app crashes constantly or freezes and prints multiple copies while being stuckso my verdict is that these are great for a small selection of simple uses but immediately give you trouble anytime you try to do anything creative active or even the most mundane uses water bottles etcso buyer beware and keep in mind how limiting these things arethe great does not outweigh the awful
11235,2,i bought two of these and for both of them the buttons dont work very welllooks like a fun little rice maker but i bought two and neither one has buttons that work well
4533,1,exactly as headline says after receiving the camera i tried a few photos and videos and within an hour the camera kept freezing on boot unable to access any settings etc i have been troubleshooting for the past few hours trying firmware updates via microsd and power cycling nothing has workedbricked camera after taking   video and   photos
3984,1,this is the second one i ibought my daughter and they both broke within  days disappointingno good
11548,4,my only issue is that its hard to use it with a timer otherwise i not only use it for cooking rice but also other foods such as curry and soups works amazinghigh utility
2480,1,poor hdmi display with a green overlay over playback or recorded video i tried  different hdmi cables with same problemhdmi ports doesnt work
5828,2,its ok for the price if you dont own literally any camera but the iphone  has a better camera than this i wanted something better than my iphone and got something grainier with less ability to focus portrait quality is only half decent  again better on iphone xphone cameras are better these days
1178,1,highly not recommend for youtubers and doesnt have the real  wasnt giving youtube qualitywasnt good quality
6046,1,very simple i bought a camera to take pictures with not to play bad video games on it or anything else bottom line  it is not images came out blurry smeared low qualityi returned ityou had  job
7910,1,i bought the kodak step because there were more reviews on this mini printer and it was cheaper but i was just never satisfied with the photos it was so washed out and discolored it just seemed like a waste of money so i went on youtube and watched reviews on mini printers and i saw that the cannon ivy uses the same zink photo paper but the quality is much better so i bought it and just tested it out tbh the cannon ivy is much better its more detailed and the closest to the actual color in the original photos im super impressed and ill keep the cannon ivy and return the kodak i hope this review helps others as wellbuy the cannon ivy instead
2253,1,i was very excited to receive this camera and test it out i was particularly interested in the feature that allowed the photos to be sent via via wifi unfortunately after several attempts this feature did not work when i finally was able to get on the cameras wifi it said that it was still not connected to the internet and this did not allow me to transfer anything over to my cell phone as the product promised i noticed several other complaints about this on the app review as well im cutting my losses and moving on returnapp feature does not work
7649,1,had stickers on the actual camera and case once you open the packaging and light scratchesscuffs  was clearly not new also it was missing the film its supposed to come with  film packets and it has zero film returned right awayused and missing film
6553,1,i received this camera as a christmas gift  i noticed right away when you click to take a picture there is several seconds of a delay before the camera clicks the picture now thatim into taking pictures with this camera this is annoying and i miss a lot of picturesalso within a couple months after receiving the camera i noticed my batteries are dying very quickly even in hours after putting them in i have been using the energizer ultimate lithium i contacted nikon and was told to update the firmware as it was  and should have been  i would think a brand new camera would have had up to date firmware for the camera being less that  months old that seems to be a problem i tried it twice with no luck to update the firmware i contacted nikon again the person i spoke with seemed irritated i called for help nikon has really not helped me at all i missed a lot of pictures at our daughters wedding this past weekend because camera would not stay on i had put brand new energizer ultimate lithium batteries in that morning that evening after the wedding i checked my batteries  were completely full one was down i would say   this is just not acceptable from receiving an out of date camera being sold as new to customer service that does not offer help when requested a  timei love my other nikon camera but sure wont recommend them againi changed my stars to only  star because of the customer service no one has bothered to help solve my problem and it has been months and now its been almost a year that i have had this camera and i basically am unable to use it due to the firmware being outdated when we purchased it and the batteries not lastingbatteries dont last firmware not updated unsuccessful customer service
16883,5,product in good condition when it arrived so easy to use if just cooking white rice havent tried other modes hope its durable design wise its minimalist perfect for those who want it that waynice design easy to use
5048,1,wouldnt even take a picturedidnt work
4418,1,i have an older digital picture screen and love it but there is allot wrong with this item nothing on it is user friendly and the instructions suck to start with the stand is a joke tilts the screen almost vertical and just falls off on its own we have  pretty good techno people working on learning how to use this and thats just wrong you have to do everything thru the remote control and it is lacking enough buttons to make it user friendly also the power chord likes to disconnect itself due to having about a  radius piece in the chord being so close to the end of the chord that it weighs it down causing it to unplug from the screen this frame is way to hard to use in every format you cant even plug in an sd card and have it work easily like other frames that i have used i bought  of these and gave them as christmas presents both are getting returned i dont understand the high ratings this gets as it is hard to use and offers a very limited and frustrating operating format if it was touchscreen you could overlook the terrible remote control operation maybe technology on these is just behindproblematic
5861,1,have a smudge on the glass i cant scratch but its a smudge and it wont come offit not having a smudge on the glass
2587,1,i had green markslines through some pictures and none were very good qualitypicture quality poor
1683,1,play video i just took the camera out the box and try to figure out how to actually use it correctly i was able to get two pictures and a short  clip before the camera just stopped working it just would not come on you can see the shadow of the screen but the actual screen of itself would not come on if you click on any buttons you can hear sound thats how you know its actually on but you cant see anything its just garbage its not even worth it on top of which you still have to buy a mic or portable ring light and a tripod stand to actually even move around with this camera is quite an investment dont waste your moneygarbage dont waste your money
2516,1,this is not worth the money i bought two and they do not work like the descendants says have to keep opening the battery door and closing it and still may not be able to take apicturedisappointed
4405,1,the picture display on this frame is beautiful but thats the only good thing i can say about it to upload pictures you can use either an app online upload usb upload or email installation sadly each works differently and the menu items you have to choose from are far less than intuitive you can load videos with sound as well as pictures but you cant do that using the app if you try youll find that all your pictures have disappeared ive reloaded the pictures numerous times and sometimes it works part way but theres always something left off and their tech support while they respond quickly is actually pretty useless they dont seem to know how their programs work and have been useless in helping me to use the proper way to get both pictures and moving videos all loaded at the same time using the same method instructions arent much better a great frame for pictures but be prepared for a long process that you may need to redo a number of times with little help offered by tech supportthe worst software for uploading pictures ive ever seen
3753,2,not the best snapshot camera even phones do a better jobwaste of money
4237,1,tried to take a picture of my wargaming miniature but it did not focus in on it instead he turned out very blurry tried every setting results were the samei want my money back
6886,1,the first one wouldnt turn on polaroid replaced it received the second one turns out its not waterproof dont be fooled by the descriptionits not waterproof
906,1,i am a realtor and i often video the inside of homes for clients im not a professional and i was using my cell phone in the past i figured i would buy this camera to free up my cell phone and maybe just maybe get as good or better quality as my cell phone well i was wrong the quality is horrible there is nothing hd about the video and it reminded me of a video from the early  when camcorders first came out the video quality on my cell phone is  times better so i am returning it yes i went through all the video settings and tried different settings in different environments all garbage guess ill keep using my smartphone i see all the other great reviews and if they think this is hd or even vga vcrthey are crazyno way guysthis is garbage
3807,1,bought for a trip since it was lightweight and small used it once just fine but later in the day the screen wouldnt work so i turned it off  min later i noticed it was scary hot i took the battery out and just used my phones camera for the rest of my tripoverheated on my trip
340,2,this  had item was received with the camera only no manual no lens cap no memory card no usb cable except for the lens cap which i am unable to locate at this time the other items i can either download or use  party items the camera appears to workused  refurbished came with the camera only
4399,2,my neighbor received this as a gift and i fell in love with it i bought one for my sister and set it up for her the picture frame is slow to react to the remote new batteries and it starts over with the same photos once it wakes up we have changed the settings multiple times sometimes it shows unseen photos and other times it starts over there are over  photos on the usb and there are no issues sending photos to the frame and accepting them its so frustrating since my sister had a picture frame she enjoyed yet much smaller and now she complains to me constantly that the frame is not working correctly multiple family members have tried resolving the issues to no availmay have got a lemon
8534,2,really surprised by the high ratings the photos this camera takes are dull and lack quality couplethat with the fact that the prints are barely larger than a postage stamp and i just dont see the attraction must be the nostalgia factor no other reason to but thisphotos are junk
239,2,update  im still using a  and gifted a relative this  since my initial review ive been able to get shots and video reasonably to my satisfaction although the lack of smooth zoom for video is a downer the reason for my update and removing three stars from my initial  review has to do my my recently learning of what appears to be some deceptive advertising of what this and the  lenses are actually capable of achieving when presented with the math it actually turns out that while the advertised focal length is a  equivalent of  the max aperture is actually  so be forewarned unfortunately panasonic and a few other manufacturers are not advertising the complete  conversion which leads lessinformed folks as i was to believe that they are paying for specs that the cameralens is not physically capable of achievingoriginal review so far so good the only unfortunate thing is that i paid full pricecurrently  cheaper however it was a timesensitive gift order i would not buy this if you already own the  but it is better than it in terms of buildquality and bellsandwhistles features the lens and sensor are would have loved a larger sensor the same but i could swear the firmware does a slightly better job with the jpeg compression algorithms i likely wont with using the  features in the near future but its nice to know they are there when i am ready while focused mostly on the  i highly recommending checking out graham houghtons youtube instructional seriesparticularly for newbies he has also started posting  videos as welloverall the  is a pointandshoot superzoom on steroids that i believe is money well spent as long as you know your needs and the  limitations going inso good the only unfortunate thing is that i paid 
1109,2,play video i was really excited to start making videos with this camera but when i tried it the image was very blurry i tried a few things in the settings but nothing worked i changed rooms and tried it in different lighting but nothing i never leave bad reviews but the camera is being advertised as a vlogging camera and image doesnt even focusit doesnt focus
13577,5,im so impressed yet another purchase i wish i had made years earlier follow the instructions hand wash get perfect rice im glad i read other reviews it seems like this is the brand to stick with for rice cookers its just me and my husband and our two year old  the smaller model has been perfect for quick dinners  out of  starsbest rice cooker
1057,1,forbworkthe camera broke after using it only one day
602,1,we needed a camera for our daughter to go on a school trip and thought a cheaper digital camera would be worth it for her to take more pictures rather than spend more money on multiple disposal cameras we specifically bought it for this trip and this trip was the only time we intended for any of us to use it she took a ton of pictures and the camera worked for what it was supposed to do on her trip however we went to transfer the pictures from the camera to our computer to save them and  of the files are corrupted the cheapest memory possible was put in this camera and couldnt even handle one trips worth of pictures the quality of the pictures are about as good as a disposable camera just go that routelow quality memory corrupted files mediocre pictures  do not buy this camera
3122,1,this films was defective or expiredall of my pictures were dark film seems bad
607,1,i purchased  of these cameras for my grandchildren ages  they have the features i was looking for in a childs camera like the rechargeable batteries but within an hour of my oldest opening up his gift his camera broke the screen would not display anything but a streak of colored lights the only way to turn it off was to take out the battery the next morning the second camera broke in the same way they are a piece of junk i called customer support and thankfully i am able to send them all back for a full refundcheaply made
6329,1,purchased for my son birthday box came badly damaged all buttons half rubbed out and its marked overpriced tat i wish i never purchased 
7845,2,its cute and accessible but theres this ugly green color filter that gets applied to all your photos if you were looking for ones that prints good quality photos dont get this onecolor is off
8054,2,not the best polaroid dont waste your moneynot the best
9698,4,this is great so easy and convenient and makes perfect rice every single time i love being able to set and forget its small enough to not take up too much space and store easily my only complaint is the display screen doesnt read a countdown timer so you have no clue how long until the rice is done the screen just has a pacman chasing pattern as if thats useful perhaps i just havent figured out how to change itotherwise super easy cleanup and worth every pennyperfect minus one complaint  no countdown timer display
446,1,i ordered this from this selection because it was to come from canon new when i received it the box the camera came in and the box for the  lens both had the factory seals cut nothing was in the factory packaging and theres no manualsused camera
8211,2, weeks on and ive had to reupdate my review  camera has gone wrong  it keeps crashing and switching off  the software is uptodate drift helpline is a waste of time take too long to reply and told me to take it back for a refund  which i did  i purchased a second one from amazon from the same supplier and that one went wrong straightaway out of the box  and was returned within  hours of receiving it  word of warning has now been over   weeks and im still waiting for a refund on one of my cameras apparently they are still waiting for it to be returned in the post post it has got lost  so i purchase another camera from a different supplier for my local bike dealer and that camera supposed to have the same thought as the other two which i purchased from amazon  it crashes and switches off  that camera has also been sent back to the local supplier and i currently have it at the technical support to find out what the problem is  from now if i was a customer i would stay away from drift xl model camera until they have fixed this issue  the date of this problem is march   im pretty sure dreadful fix this problem and it would all be good in the end the first camera i purchased from drift six years ago i never had a problem  so i know the company does make good products im just really disappointed thats all upgraded to a new model another nothing but trouble 
5309,2,i gave this to my granddaughter for christmas she loved it the batteries were already in the camera the picture quality it terrible but it doesnt mean anything to a  year old she went through all of the film and i had to buy more on christmas day unfortunately it had stopped working i assumed she had used it so much the batteries went dead i went to change the batteries yesterday so she could use with with her friend when i realized the battery had exploded i tried replacing it but it wouldnt work here i am january  last day of returns for the holidays and unable to return it i cant find a phone number to callbattery exploded
7797,2,i think the drone works fine but my problem is that the instructions are so poor that i dont know how to use all the functions first the manual is so tiny i have to use a magnifying glass then some chinese writer did not know how to explain things in clear correct english the app that you download to use camera features is even worse i tried to find videos from other users to see if i could learn from those but they didnt answer my questions and there seems to be no support on line or anywhere else instead i saw lots of videos for the vast number of similar drones that made me wish i had gotten them instead get some decent documentation for crying out loudlousy instructions
17307,5,i love how simple and easy it is to use i was looking for one that holds a lot  also its cute and simple rice cooker
3276,1,had to give one star because wrong lens hood wrong lens hood sent
5690,1,we didnt get to use these because the printer stopped working after the first use so threw them awaynot used
8494,1,bought this for my daughters wedding for guests to use and insert their photos into a guest book after doing a lot of research on these types of cameras the viewfinder doesnt match with the picture produced the picture develops from a completely different viewpoint than what is seen i have used it a little at other events and still find it disappointing i understand the quality is retro but for the price of the film and camera its not worth the investment as an artist i may experiment with it more and try some bw film or other subjects but it will likely be stuck in a drawer instead of usedupdate  camera will not power on even after charging the battery wanted to use for my sons wedding and could not only used the camera  very disappointed removing starsdisappointed
8828,1,pictures were too dark poor qualitypictures came out too dark even when they were taken in the sun
3926,2,i received the camera with all the items but i never received the two films missing films

11112,5,love using the rice cookergreat product
4593,1,i am very upset it did not come with the kit it was the camera by itself and i bought the bundlethe camera is nice but didnt receive the whole kit that i purchase
14850,5,this one looks really small and can carry in check in baggage for trips it can cook  cups of rice which serves family of  rice does not stick to the pan and cooking rice is easy nowlittle one perfect for small family
1135,1,the image quality is extremely poor i wouldnt even recommend a budgetstarter camera  look elsewhere after cycling through all the settings i was unable to find a quality image that would not wash out the image while trying to create youtube content i have a  light setup and was still unable to get this camera to give me anything but almost a grey scale image i have since decided to invest in a much higher quality camera and will be purchasing the sony  for youtube content
2378,1,had to return it and get my money back didnt turn on or take pictures sucha wastedidnt even work even after putting batteries
4925,1,danny upload to phone via wifi how very  centuryno wifi uploading of pic
5910,1,the case sent with this is made by polaroid for a polaroid printer and doesnt come close to fitting this camera which is obviously a kodak no idea how well the camera works but the product description was way beyond misleading also the only option was to return everything which is a huge hassle for us easier to go buy the correct case at walmart would have been happy if they would just send me the case made for this cameratotally misleading
14733,5,we have gone through many rice cookers in the past the inner pot is the issue after time the inner pot peels i was told when it starts peeling it is toxic and should not be used i contacted the companies to buy an inner pot only to be told they model i have is no longer available so no parts or there is manufacturer backlog and they dont know when they will get more this new rice cooker is a ceramic coating and hopefully will not peel in the long run my only issue is the measurement lines inside the pot are difficult to see overall we love iteasy to clean
399,1,so bad camara i dindt like ik for nothingvery bad camara
623,1,the casing was of a very cheap plastic have not printed out photos yet so i do not have an opinion about the picture quality yetvery poor quality
4851,1,the blackfilm would not eject no matter what i tried i watched numerous youtube videos replaced the batteries tried multiple brand new packs of film  all a waste it did not work ive requested a refundblackfilm wont eject
4107,1,the setup for this product is amazingly easy it took literally just minutes that was the height of this product purchase the rest was a disaster heres a brief timeline of what  days later camera was offline batteries were dead even though camera wasnt used after initial setup and motion detection was turned off arlo web support showed a large number of owners with the same issue there was a mention to install firmware but no clear instructions on how to do such a  days later base station went offline web support stated to power cycle it which did not solve the issue the following is an excerpt of what else you as an everyday user could do insteadensure that dhcp is enabled and that routers dchp client list supplied an ip address to the base station if it did the base station appears in the client list for more information see your router documentationyou might want to temporarily lower the security settings on the router or temporarily place the base station in the dmz to rule out any firewall restrictions if you make these changes power cycle your base station as described in step  to make sure that ports  and  are open on your routeri suppose whomever created this instruction would have no problem doing whatever this means and that suspicion is confirmed by the following statement on their support pagenote if you do not manage your internet environment contact your it department for assistancepretty incredible statement of instruction to have for a consumer product my personal it department was off that  days later attempted to call phone number listed on their site was disconnected  consecutive times after the initial recorded greeting attempted to call back a  time and only heard an error messageim returning this to amazon and hope that they chuck it instead of selling it to any unfortunate soul the fact that it became useless in such a short amount of time means that their qa either only tested it for a day or two or that they knew and were complicit or that they dont have a qa procedure in place after my rotten experience with this product it could be any one of those thingsuseless a product rushed to market
6781,1,the tripod is complete garbage  ultimax sold in the kit is trash and i cant believe canon would associate their great camera product with an accessory of this quality very disappointed i can not return without returning everything in the kit fing garbagetripod garbage
1988,1,i have a box of beautiful polaroids from the mid  that are still vibrant rich and crisp i purchased a polaroid now camera for christmas  for my daughter and the difference is night and day literally because the new polaroid photos look like i took them in a dark tunnel while traveling at the speed of light the new pix like the sad ghosts of polaroid past grainy anemic and unfocused the picture quality was so bad i thought the camera was faulty and returned it and the second one was just as horriblei uploaded new and old pictures to show the drastic difference the pictures on the left are  yrs old and the pix on the right are a month old how could quality have gotten so much worse in  years its mind blowing i also have polaroids from  that are better than the  though not nearly as good as that  camera that i wish i still had sighmy review is if you never had a polaroid and dont remember that they used to be like real photos and if you like blurry shades of grey you may be ok with thispolaroid what the heck happened
14090,5,i have used the previous rice cooker up to  cups for almost two years it works fine but inner pot scratches so purchased a new one only up to  cups works fine but not multigrain unknown reasoneasy to clean and quick to cook but not multi grains

3814,1,dont be fooled by the  mp description yes it can put images out in  mp format but they are only  mp quality the pixels are just replicated to make it a larger file if you want a  mp camera go with this one if you need something better find something elsemisleading image quality

3390,2,this camera is not intuitive at all for even an adult to use let alone a kid the center button is not the okayenter button you use up and down arrows to navigate left to right in the home menu but then when playing the games on the phone the center and ok buttons become left and right even though they are both to the left and have no indicators of being leftright buttonsprintout is black and white only i like the different print settings which ive demonstrated in my thumbs up photo by printing under different optionsfrankly every photo i take with this looks creepy the printout feature is cool but its a pain to get there even when i know howi just cant recommend this onenot intuitive to use
4787,1,im not one to usually write a review on amazon because most of the time if the item is cheap and doesnt work i just return it and order a new one in this case i was mostly upset because after reading the reviews i there was a  chance that i would get a camera that didnt work stupidly i took that chance giving the company the benefit of the doubtits a cute camera easy to use love the idea the company is trying to target its consumers with but i would not recommend this product in my case the photos came out too dark i literally had to stand right in front of someones face just to get their image on the print if i wanted to change the photo lighting settings on the lens i was sol i even ordered a new one thinking it was just poor luck but even the second camera i received did the same thingtake a chance like i did and see if it works out better for you or dont bother wasting your time and money wish this product was betterthe lense options for different photos is not functional

3541,2,loses  for major problems which are poorly documented i have a gopro  which ive been very happy with so i decided to try the hero  huge problem  if you set the video mode to highest quality  the video wont play on older pcs i spent several hours researching the docs the online forums  even youtube videos but all i could find were vague references to the   codec a better video card  a better pc but nothing specific however its obvious from all of my research that this has to be a known problem with the hero  given the popularity of the gopro series of video cameras i really fault them  for not being explicit anywhere about this problem last it loses an additional  because i could never get the menu options in the docs to actually work on the camera why bother getting the hero  when the hero  works just finenot recommended unless youre prepared to accept these problemsvideo mode  highest quality wont work on older pcs
2121,1,same problems everyone else has with the lights on but it not working film put in properly was advised by camera company to take it to someone that repairsummm dont know about yall but we dont have a camera fixing place within a  mile radius dont expect a  camera to break after one month and it wasnt the batteries and we used the exact film it came withwhich was super expensive to buy then were stuck with it because the camera cant be fixed and i couldnt find a youtube video with a fix do yourself a favor and buy a cheap  onebroke after one month

1694,2,it stopped working after a week of use i dont recommend if you want a camera you intend to use more than a couple timesbroke immediately
17329,5,japanese rice cooker is always the best i need it as alwaysperfect
9111,1,im not sure why but this film is awful i followed all instructions and every picture i took came out underdeveloped and with a blueish tint to out no color at all just splotchy and dark this isnt inexpensive film either so this was a huge let down would not recommendthe film is pretty awful
3066,2,setup went smoothly except firmware update very buggyone of two cameras was doa would not even turn onglitches
6535,1,everything seemed legit the blue lights lit up and everything i charged it all the way numerous times and the product never worked for me doesnt work
6707,1,im super disappointed with this purchase and will be returning it a lot of the reviews and videos i watched on youtube and tik tok raved about this bag but theres nothing about it that justifies the price tag i was expecting to receive a good quality bag that was going to fit all my camera gear and be really comfortable the straps are horrible and offer zero support and overall it just feels like a flimsy cheap backpack it fits a small camera and very little gear but the top compartment is so small you could probably only fit a sweatshirt and nothing else if you like the logo dont count on it being on the bag either the bag i got doesnt match the photos online missing logo on frontmaybe i received an older version im not sure overall theres nothing special about this backpack and you could probably get one of similar quality for a lot less moneynot worth the price
3595,1,i only received the gopro but paid for the bundlewhere is the bundle
2471,1,we got this for our  year old daughter for christmas and we put the little memory card in and the camera got so hot after not even  minutes of use and the medal where the memory card goes in got so hot it burned my daughter and left a burn mark on her fingerthis burned my daughter it overheats
8741,2,my autocorrect changed that to doesnt come with fun which is maybe a better way of saying it nice retro toy but be sure you get some starter film at a minimum especially if its a gift our daughter was off to a taylor swift concert on her birthday and was really disappointed to find that while shed of course have pictures on their phones shed do without polaroidsdoesnt come with film
3756,1,second time to use camera and getting card protected error even though card is unlocked seems we are not the only ones with this issue and since we went weeks before trying to use again we are outside of the return window by  days please advise how to get refund or replacement thank youcamera sensor switch per google not working
4876,2,got this for a christmas gift for our daughter and within a month of her having it and only going through two things of film it is not working anymore pretty disappointed and when i called i was told i would have to send the camera in for them to work on it you shouldnt have to be doing that on anything youve owned for only a monthdid not last long
7859,2,paper jams happen far too frequently the back is impossible to put completely on color is off the app wont do the firmware update this was really a headache of a purchasetoo many paper jams
8349,1,i ordered this canon and the battery had moisture on it i cleaned it off put it in and then the screen was glitching save yourself the time
8458,1,i bought this camera set as a gift in december  last month after using the camera only the amount of time it took to use up one of the film cartridges the camera now will not turn on and or stay on beware of amazon not offering a return or exchange for this item after one use the person i gifted this to is now no longer to use or get a new camera as a replacementbuyer beware
1939,2,used it for a couple months now it wont work wasted so much film light just blinks redstopped working
4084,1,where do i start ok so i have owned ip cameras mainly foscams and amcrest i tell you they are hard to setup if you are not a tech person but reliable and you have total control of them i thought i give this cloud based security system a try i got the cameras on bf not a bad price so i bought two of them very easy to setup video is not the best quality but ok for security purposes night vision can greatly improve app has issues but nothing terrible i tried it in both ecosystems ios and android i think ios is better than the android app but thats just preference to get live view of the cameras takes about  seconds the notifications are reliable but can get annoying make sure you setup the camera for side to side motion detection it does not detect when someone walks straight to the camera until you get to about  feet from the camera overall is not a bad camera and the system is not terrible but what really prompt me to give this a  star is their customer service if you check the netgear arlo community you will see that on saturday nov  they started getting problem with their servers there were lots of complaining going around and i was one with a complaint my main complaint was battery live and their lack of communication with their customers they never reach out to us or sent an email that they were having an issue with their servers i was told about this when i contacted them through chat it affected my batteries which drop from  to  in a matter of  hours terrible so one of the customer service reps told me dont worry if it is like that after  days we will replace the batteries because we value as a customer so i waited the two days finally servers were working again but my batteries were still showing  and dropping on both of my cameras i emailed them again they sent me an entire email with  questions to answer just to replace the batteries and they were denying that they had issues with their servers unbelievable i did not want to answer a questionarie so i reply just letting them know that and sent me back instructions on how to resolve the issue i followed each one and it did not help then they sent me another email again with about  questions to answer i had it with them and their lack of resolving an issue if it werent for this terrible customer service i would have kept the cameras but i am returning them and probably sticking with my ip cameras again if you have time to invest on answering so many questions then go with these cameras if not then just skip themcameras are ok but tjheir customer service stinks
4191,1,this camera was great for a few months and then stopped turning on for no reason we replaced the batteries and the film and nothing works amazon wont return it and we went through the process to warranty it through instax filling in all the information and sending photos and the reply from instax was  we apologise for the inconvenience we are unable to provide warranty coverage outside of indiawont turn on and warranty is not honored
5331,1,defective replacement just as bad bought for my  yr old niece disappointed pictures are darkdefective replacement just as bad bought for my  yr old niece disappointed pictures are dark
866,1,dont waste your money i got this for my daughter for christmas and the thing took  pictures and started flashing error codesbroke after  pictures
4536,1, seems to make a good product but they have the absolute worst customer service around rethink before you purchasea good camera ruined by poor customer service
6628,2,after two years the battery system is history other reviews echo the same concern buy a case of double a batteries if you choose this cameranikon forgot something
5740,1,says its compatiblebut isnta waste of  buy this for your fuji instamax
13772,5,i love this rice cooker its the perfect size especially underneath the cabinets to store on the counter we have the a much biggertaller rice cooker that we use for bigger gatherings with familyfriends but for someone that wants to make smaller batches this a great size and its easy to travel with too i like how its multifunction tooworth it
2000,1,says charged but wont turn on and has low battery warning super cheap feeling as soon as i opened it should have known  would not recommendnot working
9472,5,the only thing i would recommend also buying would be a little adhesive clip or something to roll the cable up other than that it comes with a paddle and a measuring cup i have made the full pot of rice but just two cups goes a long way also its just one switch and ive made soups and stews in it already tooperfect counter size
8811,1,all photos come out wrong followed directions either bad film or bad cameraall photos come out white exposure wrong on camera
4051,2,the camera that came with this unit was defective it never stayed connected for more than  minutes i would have to pull the batteries it would reset stay connected for  minutes then showed offline until i pulled the batteries again this didnt stop it from using the batteries completely up within the week thoughi purchased another camera from amazon to have two cameras this one synced to the unit and worked fine or as intended anyway im torn on how to rate this system it is battery powered which gives you a lot of flexibility in placement but the field of view is pretty narrow it is actually so narrow the motion detector very often trips the recording but it shows nothing because the motion actually happened outside of the fov of the cameraspeaking of the motion detector another problem it had is it would catch motion but the recording would take so long to wake up and initialize you sometimes only get the tail end of what happened and occasionally nothing at allalso the leds arent very powerful so at night the range of useful picture is very short i would say anything past  feet you dont have much hope of catchingthe image is  but it seemed very compressed and of poor qualitylastly netgears tech support as i mentioned earlier one of the cameras i had the one that came with the base system didnt work out of the box i did a large amount of troubleshooting and research on my own enough to be sure that the camera was defective and it wasnt the batteries or a weak signal or something i decided to go through netgear since the base unit worked and the other camera worked i didnt want to pack up the whole thing and return or exchange it to amazon i was hoping i could just get netgear to send out a replacement camerai contacted tech support and opened a ticket detailing all the things i had tried so far and made my case for why the camera was defectivea full day later they contacted me and asked me to repeat some of the steps and to try other things like reboot my cable modem and router things that shouldnt effect this camera connecting to the included base stationanyway after going round and round with them over the course of  days i finally got them to admit the camera was defective and offer to exchange itheres the kicker though they wanted me to either pay to ship it back myself then wait for them to receive it only for them to send out the replacement ground shipping some of you might know ground shipping can be as fast as two days but more often than not it is closer to a week so i could have been without this camera and if i hadnt bought an extra camera without the whole system for up to  weeks depending on how long they took to process the camera i sent back unacceptable to me considering this was brand new and defective out of the boxthe other option they offered was i could pay  for them to crossship a new one to me again an option i feel is unacceptable since their own quality assurance dept should have caught this and i already spent plenty of my time on their defective equipmentsince these were the only options offered both involved me paying my hard earned money to get them their defective gear back i decided to go the free option and return the whole shebang back to amazon and be done with themi gave them  stars for the idea the execution support and service cost them the  idea execution support and customer service stink
3954,2,all i got was the camera case and film literally got like nothing else in the advertised picture got nothing
14119,5,decent rice cooker in olive green instead of plain white works well in different cooking mode has the option of making brown rice and congee which i like good for  peoples portion it takes less time to make rice than the one i used to have i like itworks well
9122,1,this is the most sad thing ever it was a christmas gift not only did it ruin the camera and broke it but we were not able to take photos all christmas with the gift i feel robbed of a momment the film ink squeezed into the mechanics of the polaroid camera dont buy this at allall of the film came in defective and ruined my camera
3546,1,i decided to take the hero  plunge after my hero  session decided it doesnt want to turn on anymore i currently own the aforementioned dead session  an og session and a hero  black all three of which had various faults and operational glitches throughout the course of ownership i expected a major performance leap from the  black to the  but have been extremely disappointed on numerous fronts especially considering seven generations of development have passed the front and rear displays are nice and the image quality is fine on a nice sunny day however low light performance is still as abysmal as it was on the  regardless of settings battery life is still not great even with the enduro battery and both displays turned off the camera will also overheat and shut down if too many highperformance settings are active at once ie  with active stabilization turned on if youre going to market these as impressive features put an asterisk next to them because there are caveats while many users may find this device adequate for their needs i do not see  generations of advancement in this camera compared to the hero  if you have a  or later i wouldnt bother with the upgrade unless the stabilization and display screens are must haves for younot the leap in performancereliability i expected
8929,1,bad batterywasted of money
8961,1,bad picture quality bad low light resolutionbad picture quality
700,1,i had only used the camera one time and the pictures came out good im recovering from surgery and i research over to lift my camera by the lens and the lens became detached from the body it is only being held by  screws whether they came loose or were not put in place with an screw lock the lens is off the body and i can not put the camera back together only one usethe camera len came off the body
6837,1,i thought it would be a nice camera if it worked buoght one from walmart a real camera made for adults you know we pay money from our income for us to get a product that worksamazon thanks for making the return process so easy five stars to amazoninteresting i just became aware amazon is like home depot excellent turnkey systemi could not get it to work and internet manual costs money i returned it
1695,1,super low qualitytrash
287,1,purchased this camera for my husband for christmas and it has broken twice in  months the first time it was allegedly repaired which took a month and we were told it would be a week we got it back took it on a european vacation and it broke again the lens will not fully extend which is what was supposedly repaired the first time i would absolutely not purchase this product i am now sending it back again at my expensepiece of junk
14717,4,this is a good little rice cooker looks nice too makes rice quickly my only complaint is the loudness of the chime when the rice is cooked should be louder id easily buy it againnice little rice cooker
6224,2,trust me no water is going to get through this cover however i have certain issues with the product this cover is big bulky hard to work with and takes up a ton of space in my camera kit my advice would be take a clear plastic bag from your local grocery store cut a hole in it for the lens opening secure it with a rubber band and shoot away dont get me wrong im not throwing this away but i live in the desert and dont expect too many hurricanes in my futuretrust me no water is going to get through 
1763,1,if i could give  stars i would we purchased this camera last year for our wedding and it ended up not working on the day of we tried to return it to amazon and amazon refused to take it back then we reached out to fujifilm they said to send to them which we did on our own dime they sent it back to us with a bill of  dollars without fixing it we called customer support because thats the number they told us to and said well if you received a ntre stamp it means that they didnt fix it and said we didnt provide a proof of purchase we sent one they also had an attitude problem when we asked for a shipping label when we already sent it to them once before and said they have to spend money shipping it back to us too they are very unprofessionaldo not buy tech support will not serviceand customer support not helpful
4829,1,my camera broke within three months and through no fault of my own completely unable to be used film cannot filter through the top rollers and the lights on the camera flash constantly very disappointedbroken
14258,5,does legit brown ricegreat cooker
14747,5,"the good pointssolid quality material and constructionsimple and easy to usemakes great tasting ricelooks good on the counter topthe bad pointsit slides easily on the counter top when pushing a buttonthe translations from korean to english in the users manual is often funny but confusingthe first thing i noticed when i removed the inner cooking pot was its heft it has some weight to it my older rice cooker had an inner pot made from very thin and very lightweight metal in fact it was so thin that it would often burn the rice on the bottom i just used the portion that was not burnt this has not been an issue with the cuckoo i have made regular longgrain rice japanese sticky rice basmati rice and arborio rice each has turned out just right i do wish this cooker had nonskid feet when i push one of the control buttons on the front of the machine it will slide across the counter top i have to use two hands  one to hold the cooker and the other to push the button not a big deal but nonskid feet would be a welcome additionwhat a wonderful machine"
14432,4,i like toshiba and it is a good product the only thing i dont like about it is that it takes too long to cook the rice it takes one hour to cook while it takes other brands between  to  minutes to me it does not matter what electric rice cookers brand you use the rice would still turn out to be the same if you follow the instruction correctly 
3101,1,so many pictures didnt turn out the film was either exposed prior or its very expired im so disappointed especially since i spent almost  and none of the photos have turned out right definitely wont be buying againterrible film
7537,1,as my first action camera i cannot attest to the quality of the pictures compared to gopro but the videos dont look very impressive to me and theyre all grainywhen using wifi you can see the view on your phone until it disconnects all the time i do not recommend this headache because when it disconnects it wont save the video it was recording unless you manually and constantly pause and record you will need to be staring at your phone in hand so you know when this happens on various high end phones no matter how close or far and nowhere near anything that would cause interference this frustration is not worth it to methe cover that you need to attach most accessories makes it nearly impossible to select the bottom row with a normal fingertip even my pinky finger is too big to barely touch the edge so it only takes about twenty maddening attemptsit didnt come with any protective films so i ruined the middle of the lens i replaced the lens but quality at different depths has degraded so like other junk i recommend not spending good money after bad and just replace it preferably with a better modeli spent  dollars for this in dec  and its incredible they still want around  id go with a cheap  knockoff that probably has the same guts with same poor quality resultspros its slightly better than not having an action cam at allwifi disconnects constantly
1502,1,trashone star
889,2,going to return this product it may be a nice camera for using as a webcam for skypeteams or taking family videosor even as a kids first camcorder it is not however for streaming an event sure you can hook up the camera via hdmi and a video capture card to your streaming software facebook etc but the quality and reliability are not solid even worst you cannot cut off the displayed information on the screen when streamingit will be part of your recording thats quite a misstep and oversight the description said nothing about that im disappointed because i really needed a camera like thisnot for streaming using hdmi
14846,5,really loved the size and the design of this rice cooker and everything can come out and it can be cleaned easily the cooker makes perfect and fluffy rice which tastes great as each grain is separated from another the price is also very reasonable with good quality of the cookerso far the best i purchased
7119,2,its like someone grabbed  pieces of  cent school folders and slapped it together and called it a photo album thats literally what is holding the album together  plastic flimsy folders i couldnt believe it was worth  if it was priced at  i wouldnt be mad i would not recommend it it is definitely going to fall apart and not last long termnot worth 
3116,1,for some reason every time i take a picture the poloroids always come out with a tear of some sort in the corner and the quality of the picture is bad i only ordered these here because they were out of stock at my local stores dont recommendpoloroids look usedpoorly made
8761,2,this camera totally sucks indoors and at night even with the flash get one that has adjustable settings for indoor or night dont recommendnot worth it
1867,1,i purchased this for my daughters birthday she was sooo happy to finally receive it since she has been wanting one for a while she could not wait to use itwell she opened it and it would not work it would flash an orange light once and then do nothing else we thought maybe the batteries it came with were dead somehow we purchased new batteries and it still didnt work i mean nothing at allshe was so disappointed we had to go to a store hoping theyd have one and thankfully they had something similar and her birthday wasnt ruineddidnt work
11093,5,love it perfect size for my needs works well wished the light stayed on when it switches itself to warm or lets you choose whether or not to not have it go to warm for instance it stays on warm until you shut it offgreat value
4320,2,i purchased this bag for my olympus omd camera kit for a trip in august i really love the bag and it worked really well for my trip if i had written this review right after that trip it would have been a  star review i have always had really good luck with this vendor goja on everything i have ordered unfortunately since the trip the bag has had a seam fail i could see how this seam could fail if the bag had been overloaded but that is not what happened in this case see my photo to see where the seam failedlove the size and functionality but
3944,2,we got this for a christmas present for our daughter and there was no film included when it advertised coming with two packs so then she couldnt even use it on christmas daythey didnt include the film
9238,1,from out of the box it does not charge unplug it in and red light will be solid then after a min its starts to flash pretty bummed going to have to go with another companynot charging
4080,1,this is by far the worst purchase ive made off of amazon in recent years from lack of technical support to actually being unable to return it by never receiving the proper return labels in time this has just been a cluster the cameras first off have a range of about  yards but thats only if there are no walls walls will severely hamper the cameras connections and if youre like most people and want to put some outside this will be an issue second the cameras have an outrageously poor battery life granted i knew i was going to have to replace the batteries on this system going in i just didnt think the expensive batteries would drain in  days per camera sometimes the cameras would go from  charge to  to needing to replace batteries nonfunctional in the same day i havent tried the rechargeable batteries but based on the reviews those may even be worse next is the actually recording the reason you get the cameras you can set the recording from anywhere between  secs as soon as motion is detected but if you keep it anywhere over  secs your batteries will drain in a day not one of my cameras lasted an entire day on the highest setting and at the  sec settings there are significant gaps between events when it begins recording again finally last but not least the system consistently drops offline i had one camera that kept dropping offline which honestly wouldnt have been the end of the world if it didnt happen to the entire system like it did every few days if your system does go off it will require a manual reset of the router and resyncing every camera you have to it which besides being incredibly annoying and unreasonable still wont stop it from happening again to be clear if your power goes out your internet goes off or if the cable is accidentally bumped from the plug you will have to spend at least half an hour resetting your system every time if youre out of town this means those cameras are off until you can get back and set them back on making them entirely useless for security purposes beyond this this company has the worst customer support of any modern tech company ive met yet including your local cable provider which is really saying something they expect you to look through their community forums to find your answers which are just a bunch of other confused and robbed users trying to figure out the same thing if you want to talk to a real person about your system expect to set at least an hour of your day aside in an attempt to talk to a real person this product has been without a shadow of a doubt the most disappointing thing i have ever bought from amazon and im bummed at the company and amazon itself for not being willing to allow me to return this product in a simple manner if you buy this know what your in for and expect yourself to be writing a review similar to this one in short orderworst security system on the market
8490,2,i really wanted to like this camera but the truth is i dont i had the instax  and decided to upgrade because i assumed having more options like the  has would produce better pictures wrong now i know that instant pictures are not going to be the same quality as those produced by a digital camera or even cell phone but what i have found is that i have to play around with the settings a lot to get even a decent picture and with the film being so expensive this is not something i can afford to do my biggest complaint however is the viewfinder accuracywhat you see thru the viewfinder doesnt end up being the actual picture you have to move the camera to the right and up a little bit overall i think the  is over half the cost is easier to use and takes better picturesi really wanted to like this camera
3688,2,hi  i bought the product shipped to israel    for the first time i charged the battery after charging was not enough to fill the battery battery i heard a loud boom dotted with electricity the charge broke down and i didnt use it the warranty expired in january and i dont have a safe and dangerous product charger right now i dont have a charger because amazon will check the quality and safety of this electricity and can cause damage to your body and propertynshlkh mhiphonetavrt led lvydav   mat viltrox
3577,1,the creator battery charger bugs out the camera making it unusable after a few recharges requiring an entire rma with gopro only to have it happen again avoidflaw with charger
7328,1,just used for  weeks and its dead do not turn on looked on the internet for a hard reset turned on once but not anymore saw too many people with the same problem in the internet it seems to be a flaw in the designpiece of garbage
10516,5,i thought it beiing so little that it would boil over like my bigger oster rice cooker which i hate because the water would spew out during cooking so far so good the picture is of it cooking brown rice and no spillage its small can really only make enough rice for two peoplebowls with one cup of rice which is enough for me i havent tried more and maybe it may overflow if i did happy with my purchasecute and not messy
4938,1,the big selling point for me was the wifi connection so i could upload photos without opening the camera and using a lead the wifi app is useless it crashes every time you try to transfer a photo 
2030,2,photo quality is badbad quality photos
716,1,this product wasnt even close to the level of quality that was advertised our digital camera from  had better controls and picture quality nothing more than a kids first cameranot a real feature camera
327,2, the lens is very  camera feels good in the hand and doesnt feel cheap black  good features for the  intuitive to  autofocus performance is very poor especially at longer focal lengths i returned the camera because of this one fault too bad because the lens is  would prefer raw supportvery unreliable autofocus makes the cameras unusable
3330,2,unfortunately this only lasted a few weeks and sadly has already broken i was happy with the weight decent picture quality sleek look  however the durability and longevity clearly arent there bummer i was hoping for a great little camerabroke fast
1948,2,quality is absolutely terrible which i guess is to be expected at this price point but i expect even a cheap camera to have a focus function and this one does not if you want to film something in very low quality from a middling distance i guess this is technically functional for that but you can probably do better at a similar price my mediocre smartphone has similar video quality and can actually focus on objects closer than a foot awayit does record video
660,2,the photo quality is not good they look super grainy the videos are okay in comparison but not great eitheroverall i understand more or less the price on this but still im somewhat disappointed with this purchase and would not recommendyou get what you pay for
3301,1,so i put the battery in and got it plugged into a charger as shown in the picture and video above but when i turn it on the screen just looks like this and im unable to do anything further the green light is still flashing if that means anything am i doing something wrong i really want this to work someone please helphelp
320,2,the lumix  bridge camera is feature rich with endless possibilities for individual configurationdslr purists will tell you that its not a match for a good dslr lens image thats technically accurate but the difference they speak of for most photographers is indistinguishable at best when your lumix  is set up correctly see graham houghtons lumix videos on youtube for help setting it upfeels great in the hand nice ergonomics wonderful to hold and shoot withvery fast focusing and a wide selection of shooting modes ia ia p a s scenes  fhd video etc  optical zoom plus digital zoom for a  very long reach read up on settings to maximize image  axis image stabilization is seamless and very  throughout the full focal length of the zoom puts it in a class of its own and makes hard to get shots easierhigh resolution lcd touch screen that can be quickly articulated to different angles of  video that is easy to use and saved in different formats plus full hd video fornatsstill shots can be saved in raw and or jpg formatsbright electronic viewfinder is a pleasure to work withtwo ways to activate the zoom makes it easy to work withim macro mode that opens up a new dimension for many photographersthe menu system and quick menu is excellent and well laid out with a great many choicesoverall a bridge camera package loaded with useful technology to assist in taking better quality imagesh o w e v e r  many owners have had issues with the zoom function button after the  month warranty it cost me  cdn to have it repaired i was not pleased and not a fanquality is an important and my camera was not manufactured in japan but chinai strongly suggest a multi year extended warranty which unfortunately only raises the price 
5988,1,making it a mediocre paperweight until you obtain one it is infuriating that you will not find this anywhere in the product descriptioncamera cannot be used without an sd card which is not supplied
11,4,so easy to usebut does not work with all phones and wont work with some cases so do your researchconvenient
2507,1,horrible quality used it once and it doesnt work any moreone time usage
6725,1,play video well there is not much to say as you can see in the video the handle was on the verge of breaking nevertheless by the time we reached our destination it had completely broken i reached out to brevite support and spoke with ryan was not helpful at allextremely disappointed  second purchase still defective
6594,1,complete garbage absolutely will not connect via wifi to my pixel  phone wasted over an hour was also delivered used returning camera software is old and outdated no manual controls at all so disappointed in nikongarbage
10494,5,size is just perfectespecially for twolittle but great
5811,2,i bought this camera because it would connect to wifi i am not sure what world the software was written in but we tried for an hour and couldnt figure it out i have a current mac mini and to install the software took an email chain to cannon to figure it out i finally got images to an iphone and thought i was done the second time nothing would connect after  resets it still doesnt work pick a different camera if you want easy wifiwifi is impossible to figure out
5463,2,the time it takes for the camera to save the photo to the memory card is wayyy toooo long this causes you to wait several seconds before being able to take the next shot even a beginner would not want to deal with this problemreturned it
9440,1,it worked great and i was pleased with it but about a month later it just stopped working doesnt turn on at all 
3805,2,it really is for a young childnot what i was looking for
10066,5,"i always use brown rice and was leery about buying this kind of steamer i had a vegetable and rice steamer for over  years that i loved it was just an oval one with the clear plastic bowl for the veggies and had a rice bowl you put in it it had a dial that you turned to the amount of time  wanted your food to cook for it was perfect for brown rice because i could put however much water i wanted in with the rice and then set it for  minutes and then later another  so i was sad when it died and nervous about this onethis one did work very well i followed the directions but did add a little extra water i found that for brown rice the recommended amount of water was not enough when i checked on it after it was done the water had completely absorbed in and the brown rice was a little too hard not crunchy or really hard just not quite right i do not like my rice mushy i have eaten brown rice all my life along with other grains i had to add more water and cook it for a little longer i did find that some rice was stuck to the bottom but not burned i have always used twice as much water to brown rice and cooked it for around  minutes i think with brown rice it will take some experimenting to figure out what works best for each person next time im going to add more water and cook it longer only way to cook it longer than  minutes is to start it over again which is easy if i end up adding too much water i will just cook it a little longeri washed it by hand and i didnt put it in the dishwasher it is small and light so it is easy to put in a cupboard there are some recipes in the manual for other grainsanyway i like this and it did work for brown rice you just might have to experiment with the cooking time and water amount a little bitthe only thing that bugs me is that the inside pan the rice goes in has two sets of lines and numbers it has cups on one side and a lower case e on the other the lines under the e do not match up with the lines under the word cups the numbers are different too the ones under the e are  up through  i thought maybe the e and the  was liters or something but am not sure i read the manual and googled and couldnt find the answer im sure it is something obvious and doesnt effect anything at all im just curiousupdate  after using this rice cooker quite often between now and when i got it i wish i had bought a different rice cooker my old sunbeam one was much better with the aroma cooker the water that is in with the rice is what is steaming the rice comes out pretty stuck together no matter how i adjust the water amount if i follow the directions and only use the proper amount of water the brown rice isnt cooked enough and is hard still another big disadvantage of the aroma is that the rice sticks to the bottom and while i dont have to scrub it off i do have to soak it for hours and apply pressure with a dish cloth to get it clean the sunbeam which i include a link for so you can see what im talking about had you put water below what you are steaming it had a bowl for the rice and you also put water in with the rice the water that was below and not with the rice is what got hot and steamy it cooked the rice just fine perfectly in fact the timer only went for  minutes so i did have to add some more time but this was no big deal often i would start the rice earlier in the day at around  or  and then cook it the last  or so before dinner the sunbeam was also much easier to clean the brown rice turned out soft but not mushy and was not all stuck together it was perfect the only thing thing the aroma has that i like better is that it does have a delay startit was this one but i am not paying this much rice steamer for brown rice"
16691,5,i thought it was too good to be true to have a quick cook setting but it worked great ive only used it once but my sticky white rice came out great in under  minutes i also enjoy that its not super bulky like other rice cookers looks good and cooks good  
12721,4,"its a great rice cooker it made fluffy rice but my  main complaints are that it doesnt have handles on the inner pot so youd need mittens or gloves to handle that the other complaint is that there is no side spoon holder it does come with a standing rice spoon but i prefer the holder on the side betterthe one thing i thought was pretty cool about this rice cooker is that the condensation holder is inside with the inner lid very convenient and different from other rice cookers ive used but it did break after the second use its still usable but its detached now so if i lose it then its basically doesnt hold the condensation anymoresomethings to consider if you are wanting to purchase this itemalmost there"
1879,1,christmas gift for  year old great at first now its january    month after opening and it no longer is working it seems a common complaint that must not have been taken seriously by fuji no matter how many new batteries we install there is no power the camera is dead there is no restarting the camera as the manual states forget about it dont even think about buying itsubpar camera i do not recommend
9009,1,i was excited to get the  friends had the lumix and loved it my first disappointment was when the battery died after less than  day use less than  images no flash no special effects i immediately ordered  more batteries later  batteries did not last a day then the led screen did not display an image but the viewfinder still worked finally i could not download images from the camera to my laptop with the cable provided i was able to put the memory card in my old canon and saved the download needles to say i returned the camera and extra batteries it took about a month for all these failures so i probably just got a lemon amazon was very prompt in refunding my purchase of course there are no black friday deals now to replace my hoped for upgradehuge disappointment
11114,5,this item is the best i use it often it is what is advertised i would purchase it again i recommend it highlygreat item
1163,1,this camera has broken down on mebroken camera
17708,5,rice comes out perfectly every time it takes longer to cook than other rice cookers i have owned but the results are much better even cooking with no burnt or dried out grains on the bottom of the pan the markings to add water inside the pan are large and contrasty enough to be easily read you do have to rinse rice before cooking it but that should be done anyway and it is important not to skip this step the pan the inside of the lid and the outside steam cap all have to be washed by hand but the coating makes it a nonissue i have used it to cook both white and brown rice to perfection i would highly recommend this machinethe best rice cooker ive ever owned
2754,2,pretty low quality camera and to be fair i was kind of looking for low quality but not like this it only turns on while plugged in which is quite inconvenient and the flash is just an led light that turns on or off very lightweight and plastic and the big lens on the front is just decoration i will be returningprobably good for kids
3473,2,picture quality much lower than expected no notice when you are out of film in the camera the flash washes out the image could go on but suffice to say very disappointed with this cameradisappointing
8306,1,gifted this for my little for christmas horrible and made wrong charge port was made wrong and couldnt even charge with the plug it came with it was the right size but couldnt plug it in would like a replacement this was beyond ridiculoushorrible do not buy
707,1,this camera was supplied only with a hdmi cable no charging cable i did receive the charging block  piece that plugs into wall  but no cable i will be returning this purchase for another brandcharging cable
1153,1,this product is no good quality is early  quality do not recommendterrible quality
4722,1,this stopped working three days after my daughter got it it wont take pictures or print and when she turns it on it wont turn off no matter how long you hold the power buttonthis stopped working after three days
4858,1,pictures will not printpictures will not print
4048,2,update  years in and  cameras have completely failed i now have a couple very expensive paper weights the batteries in them had died and when i tried to put new ones in the cameras would not respond they simply have no power and will not show signs of life ive tried three different sets of brand new batteries which work on two of the other cameras but the other two are completely deadthe second complaint is with the outdated wireless technology of the nonbase station cameras if your routers password has any special characters your camera will fail to connect your routers password can only have letters and numbers this is  right why should i have to make my home wireless system less secure to add a security camerai guess its time to look for a new  no wires  the batteries last a lot longer than i was expecting i bought these  months ago and ive only had to replace the batteries in a couple of the cameras two are still going strong but are getting pretty low there will be days that go by where i dont pull up a feed but i seem to get a ton of mileage out of a set of  customer service sort of i had a camera go bad where it always displayed the image in a pinkhue so i needed it replaced be prepared to wait on hold a long time the online contact is the easiest way to get a hold of them it took quite a while to get the replacement but they did replace it for free generally it sounds like they make you send back the bad one before they will send out the new one but they waived that option for me and sent me the replacement first i would have expected this to be standard considering these are security cameras and i would have had a blind spot while i waited for a new  the battery indicators need some work when the batteries do finally start to get low the indicator will go from say  down to  in a matter of minutes where as it will have spent the last few months dropping from  down to  the lag in recording is long really long when someone walks past the camera theyre long gone and out of the frame way before the camera ever starts recording it can be as long as  seconds that it will miss after motion detection this is even with the sensitivity turned all the way up my one wired cameras videos will start at  seconds prior to the motion detection and never misses  if you log in from multiple devices a random camera hooked to the base station will trigger a motion detection every time you switch devices for example i have an iphone and an android phone with one logged in the instant i log into the other device a camera will trip like motion was detected its not a single camera either i have  hooked up and it could be any of  no way to change the password or control the encryption of the included base  sharing a video just provides a generic link to the video with no login or security at all anyone with an internet connection can view  they cant see through windows the wired ones can because they are pixelbased not  no audio the newer models have added this  netgear recommends not using rechargeable batteries again the new models have added this as wellwirefree is nice but too many cons would go wired if i could do it again
16970,5,i absolutely love this cooker i went to purchase a second one possibly a smaller version but it has been discontinued  i just love this dutch oven cooking pot so i am very disappointed love the enameled cast irondiscontinued why
2590,1,still cant get it to take pictures and yes i did put in film and batteriesitem will work
8979,1,for those who know minolta for their excellent optics in the past be aware this has no relation to them at best the rights name has been sold on at worst it is using the minolta name on cheep knockoff itemsnot real minolta
5880,1,i wanted to love this product but its just been issues since the original purchase to start the first one we received had a faulty printer but the  one worked like a charm not even  weeks into using it we noticed the ui was being finicky and freezing a lot we just decided to live with it because it did work but sadly every month we come back to use it it just gets worse with it now not even being able to let us view more than  photos without freezing we also have a  sd card in it that can hold thousands of photos but its seemingly full after  pics according to the device overall this has not been the gift i intended it to be for my wife i wanted it to be a clean cut way for her catalouge our new daughters memories but its just become a headache after every use when it works it works but once the issues start coming in its not worth the money or time investing in it all in all look for a better product or be aware this one comes with faultsseems great but isnt
5915,1,after unboxing and fully charging my daughters camera we loaded the paper per instructions before familiarizing ourselves with the camera features we took a couple of pictures and before we could print the camera powered down we have been unable to get the camera to turn on since for the last couple of days ive been trying to get some technical support from kodak and have had zero luckdoes not work and impossible to get tech support
1996,2,feeling nostalgic i purchased this polaroid camera i am on the fence on this purchase with todays high picture quality from cell phones and the quality you get from this camera you will be disappointed the film is also quite expensive i will use this camera maybe  times a year my expectations were too high sorryquite expensive for the quality
8925,1,cant rate iti know this was used and was very familiar with the seller was supposed to be an excellent condition however it was completely dead on arrival would not turn on could not charge the batterya battery charging error would occurmay try to buy a new one because for the money the specifications of camera seems pretty impressivedoa
6773,2,i dislike that i was not aware that product is used as it arrived dirtycase was dirty and scratched i couldnt find anywhere where it says its used
4060,2,i first installed five arlo cameras at our house in early december ive been impressed with the battery life  the batteries didnt die in the first one until early april five months later and thats despite the camera repeatedly being left on when we were having yard work done in other words it did a lot of recording with that rate of recording i would have expected far shorter battery life on battery life i had one frustration where the first camera to have its battery die never reported having a low battery until it actually died  but the second camera to die has been reporting its battery level so im okay thinking the first was a flukein terms of sensitivity the cameras are good but not great i definitely get a lot of false positives and i know of some false negatives as well there are times when weve received packages or cars have pulled up that the camera didnt catch id say it correctly turns on about  of the time though which is pretty good for a batterypowered camerathere is one glitch that is frustrating and is the main reason im giving it four stars instead of five the other two issues are too minor it seems the system can only support recording from one camera at a time that means if theres motion that moves from one cameras range to a second cameras its lost weve often missed footage of packages getting delivered  the camera on our driveway correctly records them walking up but the second camera on the front door never sees them and it seems like always happens when the first camera is still recording when they enter range of the second oneif that last problem wasnt there id say  stars still its a good system it gets great battery life the user interface is pretty easy to use and you cant beat the wireless element i have cameras installed where i could never put them if they were wired without running ugly wires all over the placeupdate i wrote the review above after only a couple months of ownership ive now reduced my review to two stars weve had our system for a little over two years and at this point its unreliable to the point of being almost useless every couple days one of the cameras will stop working some of the time taking it down removing the batteries waiting a minute and replacing them will turn it back on some of the time new batteries are required even though no lowbattery alert was ever issued some of the time they just wont come back onwe just had a notable event occur outside our house and so i opened the cameras only to find that only one of the five has been working for the past week arlo sends email notifications when batteries are low but apparently not when cameras just arent working at all so nothing was recorded and without checking manually each day we had no way of knowingi wouldnt recommend the product as it stands right now and im hesitant to buy a new arlo device knowing that reliability is such an issuegood initially but not after some time
2718,1,it worked for  minutes we charged for  hours now only works while plugged in turns off immediately after being unplugged we want a refundstopped working the day we got it
5,4,this charger does work for my iphone  and iphone  it isnt too fussy about placement but if it is moved slightly it can stop charging which can be a problem if you touch your phone during an overnight chargingi did purchase two more i havent had the problems others have reported such dying after limited usage getting too hot or giving an incomplete charge id rate it as good value for the moneypretty good
1822,2,i have had a number of different instax cameras in the past and loved them this version is the worst though since you are unable to make any adjustments to lightnessdarkness exposure or flash you would hope that the camera would do an adequate job auto selecting however every picture on different packs of film has been completely blasted out and over exposed weve tried to do a bunch of troubleshooting and nothing seems to do the trick such a bummer to waste all that money on this new versionoverexposed images with no manual way to adjust
5292,1,this was a gift given to family member and they seem to be pleasedone star
6396,2,despite the review this camera does not do well under ocean water even in the glass clear waters of turks and caicos it turned all the reef coral plant life and fish into dull shades of bluemy family was very disappointed when i downloaded the files because we expected to see at least a remote semblance of the amazing underwater sights experiencedmight do good riding a bike but do not trust it to convey the beauty of underwater landscapes at allnot suitable for snorkeling and scuba
975,1,no zoom lenses didnt screw on returned no name garbage with no zoomgarbage
6474,2,there is no stand it is the monitor only no stand
3207,1,my biggest regret is that i ignored the reviews every problem everyone was experiencing i experienced after the first dayat first the speedlite operated beautifully and i was happy with my purchase the next day i went to shoot and the flash was dead replaced the batteries nothingdont make the same mistake that i did invest in something elselisten to the reviews and avoid
11930,5,"i first purchased the  cup which is great for two to three people i realized my family loves fried rice the  cup was ok if thats all i was making i went ahead and purchased the   cup so we could have plenty of rice leftover i however almost wish id bought the  cup if your family loves fried rice dont hesitate buy the  cupas for the   cup model my only disappointment was it slides on the countertop very easily im gonna have to get some grips for the feet these however make absolutely the perfect rice every time i only decided to buy the   cup since i only have my stepsons on the weekend and i figured i would just use both if i needed tooi have  rice cookers now"
13415,5,good for a small family rice is cook after  minutes but has no keep warm option it turns off automaticallyrice is life
6414,2,unfortunately i got a broken camera because the sd card wouldnt mount properly and was floating inside the camera it only worked for the initial four pictures i took testing it before i took it out for a day of paddle boardingthe bracket for the sd card was broken
571,1,not a good camera for the price asked for it i dont advice you to buy this one as i am already reselling mine i bought it  weeks ago it has a poor quality in pictures and in videos so overall i did not had a good experience with it 
4735,1,my daughters sd card will not stay down when we try to put it in i am very upset as you cant take picture with the camera unless the sd card is in and will not be recommending thissd card will not stay down
3576,1,took twice as long to charge it as it took to drain the batteryand since there isnt a removable battery youre stuck charging it all day for a few hours worth of recordingbattery blows
1401,1,the pixelation is horrible i bought this to take pictures of my  week old and it made her look  auto focus feature is terrible all around poor qualitynot good for photography or videos
6228,2,purchased this and realized that it is basically useless for filming with the prime  canon  lens on the canon  camera in which i use it is too big and the design is really only good for the kit lens or a telephoto lens i emailed altura about this and received no response from them so i am not happy with their customer service either it would be good for bigger cameras or dslrs with large lenseswouldnt recommend it for a dslr unless your using a large zoom lens
9242,1,after few short months item stopped workingitem stopped working
625,1,this company offers a  gift card for giving them a  star review thought was a great camera no thanks returning cameranot a great camera not going to be paid for a  star review
224,1,did not receive all that was included in the purchase no bag no sense cards very dissatisfied 
6763,2,too much paper on the roll so i had to remove  of the paper to make it fit in the cameraroll doesnt fit in camera
3376,1,lightweight and not very sturdy you get what you pay for explains the low costnot great
880,2,i bought this camera to use with obs for getting my podcast onto youtube i did my research and found that all i really needed was  at  with an iso above  to make a quality still videothis camera can do this but only thisto start off the camera has an hdmi out which is great its pulls full  and looks halfway decent but the way it goes about it is all wrong all the camera does is mirror the screen not the image the camera is taking so in order to record from the hdmi out you wind up having the entire menu overlay in your recording before a single soul says you can turn this offyou can notnext the issue lies with videos stored to the sd card they are  grainyyou turn up the sharpness and try to pull a little gamma out to make the grain fall away into the dark spots of your recordingnopeits just adjusts what color the grains are pure useless trash for anything professionalmy main issue lies with this the option to record directly to obs via usb is there the only problem is this camera only records in  over usb to add to this the image is so grainy and fuzzed out that even post processing with obs to clear it up is useless you wind up with a sharp grainy video that looks like it was shot with a iphone  in all i really wanted to like this camera i tried and tried everything to get it work or to adapt it to work for my needs but honestly the manufacture lies in the description the only way to get  out of this thing is to use the hdmi out option all other options are  but you cannot record anything of worth because the cameras overlay is in front of everything you try to record once again there is  option to turn the overlay offif you are looking to use this as a professional camera of any kind and i mean to even basic stream with look elsewhere because this thing is a slapped together hunk of junk that barely does what its advertised to dolies lies lies
6156,1,i wouldnt even recommend this for a child my kids leap frog camera takes better photos worst purchase i have ever made quality suckswouldnt recommend
2140,1,i received this like new product from amazon that was defective right out of the box the lights flicker and dont turn on properly to my surprise i found a printout from a previous customer in the box mentioning the same problems and requesting a refundit seems that amazon had resold the same faulty product to me without bothering to fix it or even inspect it properly its very disappointing i would not recommend this if they are going to sell used defective products without proper disclosuredefective product i was sent the return of another customer
1514,1,horrible quality pictures were not usable returned it immediately 
1891,1,super excited to receive this unfortunately it has ended in disappointmentthe battery cover wont click in and continues to falls offi gave this as a gift to my husband for our anniversary when we set it up and wanted to use it we found that it is broken and does not workunfortunately i ordered this in june the last day to return it was the  of july i gave it as a gift today august  now we are unable to return this lemon money down the drainwish i would have ordered from a different companyi do not recommend buying anything from this companymismatched items  disappointment
4489,1,not useful whatsoever  please do not order this its not a useful good packaggeone star
1470,1,bought this camera to take to europe vacation only takes like  pictures and the batteries go dead after trying with numerous new batteries gave up luckily grandsons were able to take pictures with their phonespiece of junk
2348,1,stopped working after literally one day returningstopped working
8091,2,i really wanted to like this i dont take a lot of pictures of things to keep as much memory as much i should and i thought this would encourage me to do it more got this as a gift from my parents for christmas and i have yet to get a good quality photo from this camera it looks a little blurry blue and the light never looks right ive done a lot of reading on how to use it correctly and what to look out for in terms of lighting flash and temperature but i cant seem to get it right its super upsetting because ive wanted this camera for so long so i was super excited when my parents got it for me and now im a little sad that i want to get a different one bc this one just does not get good photos im a sentimental person so wanting a different camera when i got this as a thoughtful gift makes me feel so bad i dont even want to tell them but i really really dont like this camera and dont even take pictures with it anymore ive taken about  photos and only one has come out decent ive seen other reviews with polaroids from the  that look way better than these which is ridiculous considering how much our technology has advanced my sister has a fujifilm wide film and i will definitely be getting that one if i ever get over the feeling of betraying my parents giftnot what i hoped
14280,5,"this gets a solid five stars based on how well it cooks rice but it has some minor flawswe quickly learned that the timer is occasionally accurate but sometimes wildly off we now just add in a  buffer because sometimes the timer will freeze for a good  minutes which is a problem when everything for dinner is coordinated to be done at the same time clearly the rice cooker is adding time to make sure the rice is done properly but still annoyingthe other downsides are clean up is more involved compared to other rice cookers and there tends to be a bit of a mess when opening the lid based on the way the steam dripsgreat rice cooker  some flaws"
436,2,i discovered after receiving the camera that you can not connect an external microphonealso i have learned from another reviewer that the camera will not record videos longer than about  minutes for these  reasons i will have to return the cameracannot connect an external microphone and can only record  minute videos
6915,1,used it to test it out when i first got it and it worked fine tried again a few months later and it completely stopped workingstopped working after one use
2858,2,there is nothing that protects the lens when its off the glass can get scratched and its an okay camera i bought this for my mom to use at her reunion and the photos from her phone turned out better i missed the return window by  days because i dont live near her and she didnt know how to do a returnnothing covers over the lens
1594,1,started up fine for initial test before trip when we went to use it on the trip the display screen was not working and it wouldnt take pictures its very low quality and not like the old point and shoot digital cameras you used to be able to buy in storenot reliable
8324,1,cute camera however the charging area broke cant charge the camera so all is lostbroken cant charge
10637,5,great little product it works just like it supposed to cook the rice perfectly doesnt take up too much space and its just perfect for one or two people i love itits adorable and it works perfectly
4874,1,bought this camera and bundle for my  daughter the bundle was nice and she loved the camera and being able to take pictures she got through about  packs of film and it suddenly jammed on the film and started flashing there is no way to troubleshoot and had to be returned for repairs i am sure she did not stop it or anything like that so i am upset that it is having an issue so soon i will update this review and let you know how the repair process went however the rating will stay at one starpictures dont look great and the camera is not easy to point for a kidbroken for no reason within  days
3965,1,camera came with all blinking orange lights  not working out of boxbroke
6093,1,this product was horrible it didnt workhorrible this camera did not take pictures my child was devastated
5528,2,ill have the time to figure out how this works i have yet to take a good picture with this camera i got this because a reviews website recommended it for macro photography  big mistake not only can i not figure out how to do that it barely takes even decent snapshots my cell phone is better wish i didnt buy this and cant say id recommend it it does have many features so i suppose if you are willing to take the time to read all about it and watch tutorial videos or what have you then maybe this isnt bad  but if youre looking for something more intuitive id look elsewheremaybe eventually
4856,1,awful photos hard to holdnot even close to the old polaroidshorrible camera
5006,2,my daughter loves the camera it however took us a pack of photo papers to realize why the photos came out useless the case that comes with this pack is completely useless and cant be used with the camera first we thought it was just the lid that was useless but then we realized the case covers the light sensors so all photos come out overexposed it is rather cumbersome to take out the camera from the case to take pictures so it is basically a useless piece when the camera cant be used while in itjust buy the camera skip this pack
10638,4,works great but it came with a broken handlereceived with broken handle
4028,1,okay long story short i had a situation where le needed to see my camera today and lo and behold there was no recording on the cloud at the time of the event sure theres  other recordings mailman shadows on walls it runs the gamut as theres little rhyme or reason for what is and isnt recorded yes ive tried many settingsi cant go into details its still a pending matter but literally i was on the porch with the individual for  minutes and the stupid camera didnt even record sadly it records changes on the front lawn when leaves blow through the trees and the shadows shift but i had a grown man dressed in a gray shirt walk right up to the door from the left side of the frame to the right ring the doorbell i come outside talk with him for more time we move around im expecting the camera to pick all of this up the camera did not send a push notification the camera did not record no evidence on the cloud no recordings anywher near that time frame it was broad daylight tooboth i and the police are flabbergasted that such a product exists and costs as much as it does they even said throw this  out id sell these things at a loss but i literally would not want to be the indirect cause of someone else trusting these arlos having bought them from me and something bad happen and the cameras fail them toomy other biggest gripe is that when it does record its a horrible delay ie i record myself entering my house all the time and the arlo system doesnt record me or my face as im coming up to the door it begins recording as im already at the door knob unlocking the house and all you see is the top of my head thats great for leos to figure out who dunnit the assailant has hair now flip that into a real world burglary situation the criminal is at my lock picking it and i doubt would look up and smile for the camera like i make a point to do for my own personal bemusment really thats a huge problem if its a sensitivity issue then lets go to the other extreme i cant sit here all day and look at  push notifications about the faintest change in the frame a rain drop a spider walking across the stoop etc i jest but when i had the sensitivity at the most sensitive it was just too much and it still had a delay in recording and the cameras are not far from the router  feet the most  wall or windows wherever the signal is going tofromnow im willing to admit that im wrong and modify this review but my experience with these cameras is that if i set the sensitivity any higher its too sensitive so i am simply at a loss i read the manual which goes over the basics but theres a lot of bad juju associated with these cameras that ive wanted to get off my chest for a while not least of which the price of this and all the accessories marked up by  by netgear so they can afford to i dunno start their own space program and colonize mars before elon musk can god knows why they went the obscene profit route but they did i digress but the other more pressing issue is that a lot of events in front of these cameras are not being recorded and mundane nothing absolute inaction is being recorded and i sit there watching the video for however long and just waste more timethis is just unacceptable and would be great if it had a  constant recording plan oh wait they do right not for this specific camera the more expensive arlo q has that feature and probably would have been very useful today when the police needed my help gee i wish i knew that before i purchased shame on me for trusting the arlo to do what it says record action silly meim not surprised to do a little digging and see if there is a prerecord function which is nothing to netgear to offer but of course in true arlo product line fashion eg the  netgear stand retail price to us  wholesale price to them the  pieces of rubber to sheath them retail price   cent wholesale price to them etc etc it costs a small fortune to add on to your cloud plan and i dont even have the right cameras to do so you know id gladly pay it if i knew it worked but how can i trust you now today was semi important to a few people not going into specifics and you failed us netgear periodso what netgear i have to buy the more expensive cameras the more expensive cloud plan just to keep my house secure like you essentially promise to do with the original arlos really what have i missed here besides the winds of greed blowing through this entire arlo venture of yours gale force winds of greed knocking over everything in their path on your way to obscene profitsi really should have just invested in ip cameras that record to my own pc somehow someway spent  on a dell cube of some sort hooked it into a router bought some other ip cameras and made my own dvr the negatives in figuring out how to do that would far outweigh the positives so called of this netgear arlo debacle which includes astronomical costs of recording constantly in the cloud which isnt even available for this particular arlo regular camera and running the risk of not catching a burglar or worse a murderer serial killer etc when the cops come and investigate what happened theyll see at my front door he has hair i guess thats a startvery disheartening in all seriousness this is no laughing matter when it comes to our families safety i would never recommend these to anyone in fact im rethinking any netgear purchases in the future routers in particulardidnt record when i needed it to today horrible delay in beginning of recording misses alot of action theyre terrible
4457,1,this frame stopped working after only  months no damage or mistreatment of the frame will never buy this brand again very dissatisfiedbroke in  months or less
4081,1,this system worked great for about  months then after a power outage it took support over two months and about  some tech support messages along with  tech support phone calls with them taking over my computer to see for themselves on one of the phone calls maybe should have done that first instead of last to finally replace the base station the first  of the some  messages were exactly the same thing power cycle resync rinse and repeat i would guess that maybe  of the messages were actually read and had a direct relevant reply too bad they were near the end which caused the replacement of the base station after i got the refurbished base station setup and all the cameras synced about  days later my isp goes down not the power just the internet after it came back up all three lights on the base station were on power internet camera and the online app said the base station was offline the cameras were offline but still recording that is to say i could not view them live but in my library there were recordings thankfully i had set up the scheduling so it would record i write tech support after waiting  days for an answer which consisted of we show  cameras online not  that i have and you should try re syncing the cameras after replacing the the batteries i now have  of the  live and available seems backwards to progress doesnt it i would never recommend this large headache to anyone and i am probably going to have to find another system since ive wasted hours and tech support has done nothing i am still within the year warranty on the hardware but that doesnt seem to matter to tech support when i mention iti am still working with support to get the cameras to be online and have them working to show battery life as well as send me notification of when battery life is low usually it sends a message to you at  we are on message  and counting original start to my support adventure  and this post was made  i hope this helps people decide what they might be in forupdate  so after contacting the specialized support their solution was the same as all the other emails and they offered to send yet another refurbished base station id say the system is offline half the time even if the cameras are still recording  out of the  cameras mostly send low battery updates if they are scheduled to record if they arent scheduled they dont send anything the two i have on all the time never send a low battery update after almost  months of little progress i had hoped my original replacement request would have been fulfilled the second time aroundterrible support and glitchy product
2447,1,the camera quality was poor and sounded like the voices were under waterpoor quality
1578,2,pics are eh not worth 
8920,1,i bought this camera because i liked the design of the battery door my previous cameras took aaa batteries the door always got weak and the batteries would fall out when i would pick up the camera my old nikon cameras took excellent pictures but the doorfrustrating i used the camera to take pictures of vehicles and the exterior pictures were okbut the interior were never in focus they looked like it on the camera but once i downloaded them they were awefulblurry pictures
3853,1,to start it was an okay little camera video quality on videos is pretty okay but the sound is horrible pictures you have to focus the camera by pressing lightly on the camera button and then snapping the pic when its clear most of the time pics come out blurry tho so be prepared to take multipleive had this camera since march  and now it doesnt even work i thought the battery was dead so i took it out and plugged both of them in to charge but they both had full battery put them into the camera one at a time and the display is no longer working i cant do anything with it now i hope i can get my pictures and videos off my memory card but the whole camera is broken now what a waste of  dollars i had it for  monthsnot great to begin with and now its broken
7896,1,i sent this printer back and got another and i have had problems with both i get errors when trying to print the pictures come out streaky or only on half the page i trouble shoot and reset the printer and still have issuesdoesnt work
4842,1,this is the second one i have bought and it broke within weeks there seems to be no guarantee rubbish product  please send a replacement  its the least you could dothe worst
6179,1,i am with the guy who was prepared to throw in the trash  i need one i can use with a tripod  and all indications were this provided for  so maybe accusations of false advertising may be appropriate there is no hole on bottom to connect a tripod screw or with slide mount  i do much on tripod shooting with a heavy long lensi will sill see if i can find a way  but right nowi would expect i would want to take the one star away they got from me on this review have not used yet but prepared to try
2822,1,i havent had a digital camera in what a decade or so since phone cameras took over i thought theyve probably come a long way since then so i thought it would be fun to have a little point and shoot well the quality is pretty bad and it feels really cheap but you get what you pay for im sure i can find some use for it but not for major event or anything i know its a kiddie camera but i still has higher expectation which is probably my own faultyou get what you pay for
10446,5,this cooker was downgraded in a major magazine review because the lid seeped condensation on the countertop during their test i have used the unit for several months and have never experienced this problem a great rice cooker for the moneycooks rice really well
8428,1,when we received our package the box kodak sent had been open slightly and  sheets were missing sheets are packaged individually in sets of  and we only got  sets for the price you pay for these sheets not getting  of them is kind of a big dealbox had  sheets missing
7450,1,it is nothing as its description pictures and videos are grainy normally i wouldnt return items even if i dislike them but this camera takes horrible pictures and video i wasnt looking for professional quality just decent quality my old timer flip phone from the  takes better pictures and video than this doesi am returning the camera
17587,5,i bought this rice cooker because ive always wanted to be able to make sushi rice well once i discovered gaba rice thats all i make i have a family of  and we make  cups every  days i am glad i purchased the larger one while its a huge device it makes the best brown gaba rice i eat it with just about everything we have pretty much abandoned white rice once you have gaba you will never want regular brown rice again it comes out with a nutty flavor perfect texture not mushy or too hard i bring it to work for my coworkers and they love it i like to add coconut milk to it and eat it for breakfast i add it to bean  rice burritos the only con the device is huge twice the size of my instant potgaba rice  the best thing ever
9093,1,i ordered the  pack bundle  photos but only received  packs inside the bundle boxmissing product
7047,1,i usually do not write reviews but felt i had to because of how bad this camera was poor quality photos the function to transfer photos taken by the camera to my phone didnt work the function to print from my phone to the camera didnt work i kept getting an error message i troubleshooted for about an hour ensuring proper bluetooth connection and that i was following the instructions properly reset the camera using the reset button deleted the app and redownloaded nothing worked and then the cherry on top is after all of that when i just tried to take a picture and print it that function also stopped working see error message in the pictures kodak advertises that this camera can do it all my question is what does it actually do i wish i had believed all the bad reviews before i purchased and wasted my time buyer bewaredoesnt work
6498,2,i purchased two of these for my daughter to use because she wants to star making youtube videos they are super easy to use and are plenty bright for indoor use however they both have something lose inside when you move them around you can hear something rolling around unfortunately im returning themgood but
4170,1,absolute garbage product  do not waste your money your phones flashlight will be brighter than this plastic junksave your moneygarbage do not buy
8903,1,this camera would have gotten  stars were it not for the battery i noticed other buyers had left reviews mentioning problems with the initial charge and power up during the first charge the camera indicated unusual charging eventually overnight the battery charged and the camera would power uphowever when removing the battery it was noticed the battery case was distorted and bulging not good for any battery but worse for a liion battery the battery supplier has quality control issuesamazon who was the seller refunded a percentage of my purchase price which i used to buy a replacement battery this is the only reason i left  stars it should be noted that not all  have the same geometry and some might not fit the camera if amazon works with minolta to resolve this the camera would be a great buy but less tech savvy persons should be cautiousafter the  month return period the flash stopped working service requests to minolta have been ignored lowered the rating to  takes decent images in daylight but not worth the moneygood camera but watch out for the battery poor product support
2887,1,the resolution on this camera is no where near  my  camera produces much higher quality images it feels absolutely cheap do not recommend itll be getting returnednot a  camera
6983,2,i took good care of this camera and even used it with a case on it i used it sparingly i even bought it for a friend in two years i have had to replace mine twice and the one i gave to a friend broke after about  shotsproduct lasts less than a year
8909,1,i couldnt get any good pictures with this camera i tried all the settings and none of them were great on auto setting you have to tell it to use the flash every timethe app is a joke it does not stay connected to phone for long it randomly disconnects to connect phone to camera you have to pair it every single time which is a bit of a processi am returning the camera i can get better pics with my galaxy phonenot good camera
8393,1,i bought this product along with the camera for my wedding and the pictures were all blurry and the camera quit working completely after i had charged it all night also the camera doesnt come with the charging cord i want able to use the camera or the film i had purchased on my wedding day would never recommend this product fuji is the brand to go withnot what i thought
6705,2,i already have another bag that has two main divided compartments  bottom half for cameralenses and top half for general storage  but wanted a slightly larger version based on the photos and dimensions this seemed like what i was looking for yes like many reviewers have stated this does not look obviously like a camera bag in a domke sort of way i got the green one and the color and material are similar to green domke bags unfortunately this does not work well as a camera bagi like the overall size and the sizes of the main compartments its big enough to fit a  computer and has just enough number of smaller compartments that i would actually use unlike some reviewers complaints about the storage capacity this bag has enough room to fit more than just a tiny camera if you plan on carrying a camera with something like a   lens attached this bag will not work for that youd need a much larger bag or a bag thats dedicated to carrying camera gear without extra storage compartmentthe main problem with this bag is the bottom compartment first thing i noticed was that its impossible to configure the dividers in the formation shown in the product photos because the sizes of the dividers are different than whats shown instead of a divider thats the right size to attach vertically from bottom to the top i received a much longer one thats the equal to the horizontal width of the compartment and because one side of the bottom compartment is the zippered side opening for camera access trying to attach that divider horizontally would defeat the purpose of that side openingand it gets worse even when you think youve figured out a configuration to make the dividers work after you load up the bag with gear and take it out for a test run the bag bulges out and the items in the various compartments fall out and end up at the bottomthe current price of this bag is almost twice what it used to be i think even the original price would be too high for this bag because of the serious flaws i mentioned this feels more like a prototype than a product thats gone through testing and have been on the market for several years so in its current state i would not recommend this bag at any priceoverpriced poor execution
6280,2,i get some things are expensive but color cards of this type should never be more that  considering how cumbersome this particular passport is to use its horrendously overpricedtheres absolutely no reason for to be this expensive
8827,1,all pictures are black very disappointeddefective film or camera
3647,1, for my daughters  bday party tomorrow i ordered the bundle this was suppose to include the camera  sheets of film the carrying case extra strap and the little booklet to keep your pictures in all i got was a camera and it was used and scuffed and the box was already torn openi didnt get what i ordered and it was used
4903,2,the photo quality is subpar for the price i wouldnt buy it againnot worth it
11923,5,"i have other multifunction kitchen gadgets that are technically rice cookers but i wanted one that was easy to use and for rice only i saw this one on someones tiktok video not promoting it in the video just happened to show it so i bought it based on how easy it was to usei eat rice myself but i also cook rice for my old pup so i end up cooking a lot of rice its nice that this can be set and forgot about while i go about my day there are two pieces to clean and they are super easy to clean the top piece you just pull the grey tab and it pops off and pops back on easy setting it up is quicki know some people complained about the  cup not being a true  cup i did a measurement from one of my steel  cup measuring cups and the plastic cup is about  cup the remaining rice is almost  cup as shown in pic but their plastic cup gives the impression it measures at a cup based on the markings i would just imagine this as  scoop in order to use their measurements properly but you can also just measure your rice and water based on the measures you would for cooking on the stovei have no regrets on this purchase so if you are looking for a real rice cooker then id say buy this onebuy it"
14278,5,really like this rice cooker by far the easiest to clean and the rice never sticks to the pot also really like the beeps when its getting startedgreat rice cooker
7603,1,i used it once and after that they didnt work  dont buy itlights
4677,1,this thing looks nice but thats about all i can say  if you have a samsung galaxy phone dont waste your money it doesnt fit and doesnt work  i bought a trail pad viewer insted this works much better sntno good dosesnt work
8771,1,not all photos will develop and when they do the quality is awful my friend got the fujifilm mini same price and the comparison is comical this is a toy camera dont buy itbad quality overpriced
6934,2,it was a great activity during my wedding but sadly it did not last more than  months it keeps displaying a flashing e and it never took a photo againwas cool when it worked
1454,1,it wont even workthis camera is very cheap and i returned
14766,4,weve had this for a few months now after i decided to upgrade our cheaper rice cooker and its been a great change it cooks the rice evenly and quickly i was surprised how fast it gets the job done we mostly just use the white or brown rice option but apparently you can also do mixed rice and more we have used the steam cleaning option that seems to have done a good job i like the timer and clear screen the buttons are in both english and korean it keeps the rice fresh for us for about  days after that the leftovers have to be thrown out i like that its not loud doesnt bubble or spill and we can store it in our cabinet after use its actually really easy to clean the inside because the pot is lightweight and soft we have never had a problem so far with the rice sticking to the pot the alert to let you know the rice is done is just a little beep i wish the instructions were more clear about ricewater ratio because the english translation isnt perfect also its better to do a minimum of  servings weve tried  and the rice just doesnt cook well upgrade our cheaper rice cooker and its been a great change it cooks the rice evenly and quickly
439,2,i want a camera that is flexible but not complicatedim not interested in a point  shoot but there should be a mode that is basically thati have a very difficult time getting the focus right its very rarely just right ive tried auto focus  manual same with the color my cell phone should not take better pictures that a dlsr camera that i spent hundreds of dollars onfor years i had only nikon equipment i wish i had spent the extra  stayed with what i knewnot user friendly
2257,1,really poor resolution so decided to returnpoor resolution
2142,1, i purchased this unit in  but have only used it once or twice since then i just pulled it out today plugged it in and the lights just flash on and off like a strobe the lights will not say on continuously no matter what outletpower supply i have this unit plugged into unfortunately i cannot use it its well outside the  year warranty but honestly i have about  total hour of operation on this light box bummer the box itself is constructed for portability and stores nicely but i cannot use it for photography zero starslights do not work properly lights flash on and off like a strobe and do not stay on continuously
7851,2,it works the app is pretty great but this is a low quality printer i just got this and its spitting out streaky washed out pictures this was not worth the money i dont recommend to buyers i bought this because my other kodak polaroid classic smile camera died after only  months of ownership and less than  pictures printedit works
4176,1,its not bright at all and it doesnt have a white light its mixed w yellow its super just not what youd expect when you think of a light definitely a waste of moneynot bright at all literally so upset with this purchase
2371,1,this is the worst polaroid camera i could have bought i bought it in october of   it started malfunctioning after a month of use and by january of  new years so like  months later it completely broke and stopped working the light just flashes uncontrollably and it doesnt take pictures just produces blank polaroids also there is no way to turn the flash off so its always on probably the worst product i have ever bought on amazon please if you wanna save about a hundred bucks do not buy so awful poorly madedon not waste your money
8167,2,great camera for the money the battery life is what sets this camera apart no it does not shoot in  but the  picture quality is really good my main reason for this purchase was for water sports the first time i used the camera on the water was the end of the camera had it mounted to my paddle while stand up paddling the camera got splashed and was not in the water for more than a few seconds at about  inches of depth it stopped working immediately and the led display at the back had water droplets inside opened the camera and dried it out overnight camera is deadgreat camera but not waterproof
2467,1,i bought it to us it in our trip to disneyland for my daughter birthday day i was hype bout this camara turns out the battery dies super fast i didnt last more then  and after that no pictures for ussad
8596,1,the light is useless and not bright enoughdont buy this camera
15479,4,looking for a replacement for my  year old rice cooker saw this and it fit my needs small and compact perfect for someone who eats a lot of rice and lives alone the cooker is attractive all stainless body with a nice clear glass lid so far ive just cooked rice in  cup batches i havent a need for more than that at a time cook time is the same as my old model for a  cup batch its fairly quick as soon as the rice is ready it switches into the keep warm mode automatically it doesnt scorch the bottom of the rice some people like that that burntish rice at the bottom of the pot is a treat some places me rather not have it but this does exactly what i need it to do makes me a nice pot of perfectly cooked rice i should mention the first few times i used it a horrible odor came from the machine i did wash it before my first use but something at the factory they coated it with was burning off but its settled down now and after dozens of uses its odorless now the pot is coated with a non stick coating and it works well when im done the rice will effortlessly come free of the pot without sticking when you transfer the remaining rice into a storage bowl to refrigerate for later use clean up is easy basically rinse and wipe with a paper towel to dry i gave it  stars for the following reason the steam release hole on the lid is big steam liquid and watery starch liquid oozes out trough that hole and runs onto the side of the pot as it cooks makes a bloody mess not a huge one but my old pot had a much smaller hole and i never had any escaping liquids to cause extra work on the clean up i do like the cooker makes good rice i can overlook the mess i can recommend this rice cooker if your dream is that  dollar japanese rice cooker but you dont want to drop the cash this is a happy alternative for less money youll be happy with itpretty decent rice cooker
2192,2,this lightbox seemed at first to be a good value its reasonably well constructed and although the light is not as bright as id like it gets the job done unfortunately the lights stopped working after  months of very occasional use so i cant recommend it to anyoneworked okay lights broke within  months
3342,1,this camera is so cheap it takes photos like a  flip phone the buttons are completely plastic and the camera feels like a toy i wanted a digital camera because i thought that it would be better quality than my iphone but it is way worse i wasted my money on itworse than phone camera cheap plasticy kidlike camera do not buy
10039,5,the design of the product is very userfriendly and can serve multiple purposes very well the only tricky thing is the timer i can only set up a timer by hours the other function works very welleasy design
13235,5,"i like the size its large so i can make a lot of musubi and small enough for  cups for normal useeasy to clean non stick remember not to let metal touch the potnice price for the sizenice size and priced well"
1157,1,took terrible pictures all blurrynot worth it
1728,2,the camera looks so cool that ultimately what led me to purchase it dont waste your money on this camera i have a  digital camera that takes the same quality pictures and it more durable if youre an aesthetic person and want the looks of this that takes the same quality pictures as a much cheaper one then by all means go for itthe power on and power off screen is bright blue that says hi and goodbye which looked a little silly on a camera that looked a bit higher endas a photographer i wanted an easy point and shoot camera to get some filmier pictures but my kids hot pink one is more durable and does just as good dont spend the money
9072,1,i received it last night and used it this morning package is in good condition but when i started taking pictures for my daughters project photos came out with small white line like dust and black line at the bottom knowing that it says the selles is the original polaroid store and this is the  time ive purchased films like thisdamaged film
1405,1,didnt work only turned on when plugged up returneddidnt work
1753,2,i bought this camera for my backward wedding the pictures turned out blurry the film got jammed twice in the one day we were using the camera we have to open the film chamber while there are films in there and throw out a good pack of  films unused when it happened again i tried to see if the films are still good even when we open it turns out it is we didnt have to throw out that first pack but we didnt know i notice the lense doors jams a lot too dont think you are ready to shoot a pic when you press one because a lot of times you will need to manually tug on it a little for the sense door to open trust me all this happened i was super excited to finally have a polaroid camera but it product was a royal disappointment its not like the films are cheap too they average  per film i do not recommend this productmeh not a good product and heres why
3343,1,if you want a cheap camera and have a perfect lighting system then i could recommend this camera the fact is if you use the flash at all the glare is so terrible everything is a blur ill be upgrading to something more expensive soon i cant recommend itthis camera has terrible glare if you use the flash i cannot recommend
7406,2,only for selfies background blurryspending some extra money and buying a nice polaroid camera
1436,1,poor qualitydissatisfied with this camera
14309,5,"we had an old simple rice cooker before we purchased this one  the kind that just boils the water dry and usually slightly burns your rice until you stir it right when it finishes when we bought this and saw it took  minutes to cook white rice we werent sure we made the right choicethe rice came out nice and fluffy not burnt at all at the bottom and using the warming function works pretty wellwe tried the quick rice feature and it was still good riceanything that you need to clean easily comes out and the rice pot itself is extremely nonstick handwash onlyyour patience will be rewarded"
6740,1,i loved the look of this bag especially in the light grey color found on their site however the fabric is almost impossible to keep clean and its just down right uncomfortable to lug around for a period of time i used it on our recent vacation to carry around my canon  mark ii along with my  lense  lense and my big  lense my shoulders were killing me after carrying it around  hours not to mention the velcro dividers were flimsy and did not stay in place so dont waste your time or money on this bagpretty but dont waste your money
7155,1,very disappointed in the coloring and picture quality of the printed picture looks absolutely nothing like the picture on my phone picture looks washed out and over exposed when printedpicture quality
2517,1,sadly when my photos come out they are messages updont buy
8504,2,scratches extremely easily film is way overpriced dont even try taking images without direct sunlight the flash is useless also every time you open the back it resets as if there are  photos left when there arent also once it wouldnt print a picture opened it  when i shut it a imageless photo came out upsetting since ive taken less than  pics this product doesnt come with any film either so its going to cost you  more just for the film  half your pics will come out too dark bc of the flash i mentioned earlierscratches extremely easily film is way overpriced
5317,1,i have no idea what happened but the camera stopped working after only having it for several weeks the button to snap a picture just wont work very disappointedstopped working after  weeks
6735,2,good your first trip with this bag is great it is solidly constructed for casual shooting and has some great features luggage pass through passportwallet pocket laptop sleeve the design is nice and i love the color yellow i get compliments and remarks on the color and lookbad the soft touch material only looks good for a few uses it is a dirt magnet and no matter how many times i wash it the bag never really comes clean debris sticks to it and even with a lint brush it is hard to get off try removing lint from a lint brush with a lint brushthe side pouch barely holds my travel tripod and the hook latch comes undone if i am doing anything but casual strolling it is too small for most reusable water bottlesthe interior section pieces are flimsy unless the bag is tightly packed your items will not stay in placethe access pocket for me is on the wrong side i like to sling bags off my right shoulder i know this is a personal thing but its annoyinglastly their marketing is intense im actually scared to leave this review in fear that it will restart the relentless ad campaign for a bag i already purchased on every site i visiti would not purchase this bag again dont believe the hype from the sponsored reviewers daily backpack for kids sure but dont set it on the ground pack for anyone doing anything other than a stroll down a clean city street i wouldnt some good features but very limited and eventually looks like a dirty dish towelok but no
8861,1,took it on a once in a life time trip to find that it didnt work  totally disappointing and frustrating i would not suggest wasting your time or money on this cameranot worth the effort time or money
4777,1,didnt like how it take my pictures not as bright as i thoughtnot as bright as i thought
1932,1,play videomy camera doesnt worki need to repair immediately
5848,1,im not sure why this camera is rated so highly i cant get an sd card to work pure garbagesd card
121,2,i think this will be a great christmas gift i opened the box and it looks like a nice camera will update as to how it works later hi i am updating my review because it was a gift it is so basic and works okay there is no adapter slot on the camera so cannot really get this camera to function as they claimlooks good
5553,1,the zoom is horriblemore can be seen with the naked eye than the zoom
2494,1,zoom is not like i expect image quality is bad toonot good quality
967,1,actually i am not satisfied a very bad purchase i will return it i have never bought something before that looks good on the outside but with a poor image quality it is not what i expected to buy i do not recommend itvery poor image quality
1994,2,i have taken  decent photos since buying it ive gone through  films experimenting with different tips for better photos but it always comes out dark or blurry waste of money better off getting disposable camerassucks
9002,1,very disappointed with this camera i can take better shots with my  year old  canon here are the deal breakers for me auto focus is garbage battery life is abysmal holds a charge for maybe an hour wifi capabilities are also garbage cant connect to anything ergonomics are terrible you basically end up holding this thing by the lens  of the timei had high hopes but im sticking with canon if youve read about how this doesnt have aa and produces sharp photos think again dont expect the results youd get from a full frame camera do yourself a favor and spend an extra  bucks and get a full framealso for anyone who is still going to buy this camera mine was an open box item but sold as new the hot shoe connector was scuffed the plastic baggies were clearly retaped together and the lcd screen smelled of some kind of scented hand sanitizer just be extra careful of thishope i save some folks the heartachebetter photos with a  dollar canon
7770,2,this is not the best camera for kids i am sorrydisaster
3627,2,loved this camera but the film i received was all black i got  photos out of the two packs and the single pack i was sent very disappointing because the film is expensive and it makes the bundle not worth itgreat camera but dont buy the bundle
14091,5,i love this little rice cooker i havent had a rice cooker in two years and i couldnt justify buying one more countertop appliance so ive been using my instant pot to cook rice i finally took the plunge and decided to get this little guy oh my god what a difference in how the rice comes out i make rice with several meals a week now highly recommendcooks perfect rice every time

547,2,horrible for close up picture taking  somewhat adequate for distance picture takinghorrible for close up picture taking  somewhat adequate for distance picture taking
725,1,i purchased this for taking images upon trying it the camera could not keep the same tone and even when it did the image was very poor i was trying to get something that took better pictures than my motog this was not it maybe be good for armature videos and such but if you want high quality photos look elsewhere i purchased this because reviews for the most part were good i dont usually write bad reviews but i dont want others wasting thier time trying to find something that takes really good pictures and buying thisquality was very poor worse than my phone
2104,1,i loved this camera so much i was obsessed then i had a faulty film pack it got jammed in the camera the camera now blinks and wont function itll cost me more to send it in and fix it waste of moneybroke after  months
3370,1,this camera is pretty bad what you pay for is really what you get just save up and buy something betternot worth your money
5920,1,took one pic and quit working wouldnt turn green with a charge wouldnt take another picture tried to reorder and they more than doubled the price and wouldnt replace price gouging at its finestworthless
5940,1,does not take good indoor photos disappointed with qualitydark photos

14839,5,this electric rice cooker is a fantastic addition to any small apartment with limited space making it ideal for a family of four with the capacity to cook up to  cups of white rice this cooker has consistently impressed me with its performance from start to finish it efficiently prepares deliciously fluffy rice in just around  minutes ive been using it regularly and i must say it does an excellent job of making meal preparation a breeze and ensuring a delightful dining experience for the whole familyperfect for small spaces and family of four
7477,1,i tested this camera dozens of times in my house with multiple sd cards it worked fine for photos and videos i took it to costa rica where i intended to use it while white water rafting sitting in the boat the first time i took a video  no problem some water splashed on us and from that point on the camera showed a yellow triangle with the words busy under it whenever i tried to take a photo or video i tried it dozens of times over the course of an hour with no change that night i changed the battery changed the sd card and took it snorkeling the next day on the boat i took some photos of family and videos of birds flying near us no problem jumped in the water turned it on yellow triangle with the words busy  i quit after a few tries over the next    minutes as i wanted to enjoy my time and try to capture the memories of my family in my mind since i knew they would not be captured on this camera not sure if i got a bum camera humidity was getting to it inside the case definitely no water got in the case regardless i never got any of the images or videos i looked forward to for the pics that did work on  the videos and photos were a tad grainy and small as there is no way to zoom through the camera images look a bit bent similar to barrel lens distortion which makes the image look spherized which affects the quality of the pictures also overall the price is great and the options are decent but the camera not working caused me to give it  star i wish i had spent up for a reliable gopro or an expensive underwater camera instead of trying something that sits in a waterproof case and cant handle the atmosphere of a tropical locationcamera stopped working every time it got near water while in case
1030,1,it has been  months since i purchased these two cameras and i should have known that you get what you pay for but i think the price for these are too high they should have been buy one get one bogoone of them has completely stopped workingwaste of money
1012,2,forgot memory cardforgot to send the memory card
6089,1, the camera dosent work il seems that there is a problem with the contacts of the batteries because the light turns on for a second and turns offthe camera dosent work
179,2,focus just getting the thing to focus no matter what setting i dont need all the bells and whistles and this really seemed to just stick to what you need with the name brand several models of history behind it you would think they got it right maybe mine is a dud and phone camera will take much clearer photos in a much quicker matte of time this sees to be only good for a  foot fixed distance of still photography really disappointed hopefully this is a fluke returningthis thing just doesnt focus i read and followed the manual and am very dissappointed
8951,1,overall my phone camera takes just as good pictures for the money and carrying a camera this camera wasnt worth the money im sure for someone just starting out  its greatnope not this one
2067,2,not enjoying this new polaroid takes too long to print photos and then you have to wait for them to dry like another three minutes way too long to wait for a phtotograph it should be fastershould be faster to print
6196,2,i was so excited when this was delivered as i want to take some rainy day photos i installed it on my canon  mark iii body with  mm lens with the lens hood attached it fits well for my configuration and it stayed attached around the lens the problem was it was hard to adjust the lens to zoom in and out there wasnt enough room in the lens area to fit your hand and reach in to zoom also the fabric material was too stiff they should have placed the left hand sleeve at the bottom to use for adjusting the zoom and adjusting all left hand buttons to use this effectively i had to unzip the bottom zipper and access the zoom adjustment from the bottom i wasted my money on this product i would not recommend itclose but no cigar
265,2,i was looking for really good vacation photos this was not the camera for it the picture quality was less than expected we actually took backups with my samsung cell phone zoom was great but ia and p were not much better than a cell phone the pop out screen would go black at certain angles defective so most of the time the viewfinder worked best also there is a noticeable delay starting the camera to getting a photo several settings have very long delays between shots this could be my inexperience with a camera like thislooking for a step above your cell phone this may not be it
4738,1,the battery would not charge i was disappointed and it would turn off everytime i would try to unplug it from the charger i bought this as a gift for little sister and had to return it would not charge
8445,1,poor picture quality do not spend your money on this productnot worth your money

39,4,this works as intended does not rapid charge will charge through case but must get more exactdoes not rapid charge
5244,2,i purchased this item for my photography class unfortunately when it arrived it was not the item as described highly annoyed i called amazon back was told the vr lens was sold out so the lens that arrived with this bundle wasthe nonvr lens was told to reorder again once it came back in stock  i found it listed again but with the same issue as before  so ive returned this  model  and now ive decided to upgraded to a higher professional nikon model unfortunately most of my photos came out very blurred  dark and it was a hassle with the manual settings i read all the positive reviews and this model nikon  just didnt make the cut for me on a professional or amateur student level i better get a passing grade this semester  im very frustrated now  pend some more money and upgrade to a better model with better lensfailed  didnt make the grade for amateur  to novice to professional 
988,2,it is only  mp camera not  like it says in the menu there is no way to save or select that option it will always default to  resolution battery last about  minutes onlynot good
7721,2,basically nothing good about this product except my kid got excited to have it she doesnt realize its total junk picture quality is terrible video terrible navigating the menu terrible even for this price i thought it would be a little better given todays technology  uh seems like 
4812,1,i bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter and it took a total of  photos now the camera is nonfunctional and according to the troubleshooting document provided by fuji it has a serious failure and is unusable the fact that the directions say to remove the battery immediately upon seeing this error worries me about the safety of the itemdo not waste your money on thisdo not buy
17336,5,you wouldnt think all rice cookers are equal they are not this thing makes the best ricegreat cooker
7141,1,as soon as i opened my box i knew something was wrong the box was open and the printer clearly looks used and dirty besides the box didnt even have a charger and it didnt come with the  sheets for the photos what a disappointment  recommendedthe camera came to me dirty and without the sheets
4600,1,this camera never workedwe never reached out to return it but very disappointing and waste of moneynever worked
282,2,this is camera is horrible unless you have an abundance of light or two inches away from whatever you want to take a picture of its incredibly situational no matter how u adjust the settingsonly good outside on bright sunny days
9082,2,used the film in a brand new camera followed directions and the pictures were foggy blurry and faded locking thank goodness we all had our phones to take pictures at the bridal showerlow quality pictures
3609,1,no desktop software and the mobile app is extremely slow and unusableunusable software
2189,2,its very convenient but the glaring overhead light is awful my ceramics photograph much better if i just put them in front of a window on a bright day i got rid of it would not recommend itconvenient but the lighting is awful
5913,2,cheaply made device for what you pay picture quality is okay the white and yellow contrast is terrible to read the menu features photo edit features are very limitedwouldnt recommend purchasing
964,1,the quality of the video is most definitely  and very clear and not blurry at all and to turn on auto focus you need to go to menu then go to the image settings to find auto focus for your videoedit october  it keeps turning off even though the batteries are charged trying touse it while its plugged in and using brand new batteries dont get itif your looking for a cheap youtube camera get it
2374,1,i loved the camera when i got it but im about a month and a half it got a blinking light and i followed all the forms online to problem solve but nothing worked tried to call fuji and amazon and it didnt get anywhere broke after a month
2268,2,instructions unclear diagrams way too small and even with a magnifier couldnt read or decipher shapes if you are over  do not buy this productinstructions are incredibly unclear
6342,2,the camera is fine for use by a four year old annoyingly sent a second hand device too late to return it 
8782,2,we used it for a wedding it was an absolute disappointment we left it thereterrible photo development
3552,1,a  paper weight worst photographyvideo tool i have ever purchased and ive been a landscape photographer for over  years took it on our aprilmay  europe photography trip to germany austria hungary czech republic and bratislava used it approximately  times for no more than  mins each time and every single time it shut down due to overheating the last time it got so hot the battery expanded and cracked the batterycard door hinge so now it is no longer weather proof and absolutely worthless do not buyoverheats constantly got so hot the battery expanded and cracked the batterycard door hinge
7483,2,video video is mediocre at best while technically the resolution is in  the quality is certainly not what you would expect if you have it outside with plenty of light it looks fine indoors or in low light its terrible very grainy with lots of noise my indoor videos had a noticeable flashing in themaudio the audio is terrible everything is very quiet and muffled you have to speak into the camera as if its a microphone in order to hear anything and even then its not great this is without any case on it if you touch the camera body adjust the mount or click any of the buttons you hear loud noises in the video with the waterproof case on you cannot hear anythingquality like another reviewers i noticed bubbles in the touch screen the camera body is very light and feels cheap it only comes with  cases waterproof and regular the regular case does not mount correctly on anything i tried the screw holes are not straight and are not deep enough to tighten up i did not even tests the waterproof case it does come with some accessories but there are no instructions included so im not sure what half of them are fordate the date and time is less than worseless it would be better if there was no datetime at all first the date and time reset back to the factor date in my case  every time you take the battery out second when the camera is turned off it does not keep track of the date and time so if you set the date and time to  at  and then turn it off then turn it back on a week later it will still be at  at  unless you want to set the date and time correctly before every video this is quite a pain by default the camera adds the date and run time to every video in the upper left corner so its not like you can just ignore it it also uses the date and time to save the video files so again you have to make sure to set the date every time you use iti havent even used it long enough to comment on the battery lifei only gave it  stars because  its cheap so i didnt expect much was still disappointed and  it comes with a remote and it seems to work fineread the neagative reviews
6049,1,the product itself is fine but its for a very small child the image it shows as ad makes it seem like a legit camera when really its just a toynot worth it
1730,2,i cant even take pictures with the camera to give an honest review when it came the lcd screen was broke and the camera was cracked now im out all that money and a camera that dont workcame broke
1031,1,thought this would be a good camera since it was small and would be easy to use while working in the insurance field the screen stopped working after a few days and only shows bluegreen lines across itscreen stopped working after a few days
9322,4,"this rice cooker is pretty basicjust two settings cook and warm it can handle up to five cups of uncooked rice or  cups of cooked rice and also includes a small plastic steamer insert so you can steam vegetables or dumplings while your rice cooksthe light nonstick rice cooking pot includes a stamped measurement gauge to makes things easier a useless plastic measuring cup and a more useful textured rice paddle rounds out the package a small port on the top allows the steam to escape so you want to keep this out from under your cabinets while cooking it produces good quality cooked rice with a bit of experimentation on how much water to addnononsense basic rice cooker that works fine"
5815,2,the camera was rated as very good condition but has a dusty film over the front and extremely strong odor of smoke grossstrong odor of smoke
3843,1,i have used many cameras  cannot figure out how these pics can be so poor quality they are washed out  grainy no in camera setting for resolution and or pic size not worth the  even though its cheapbad quality pics
3650,1,the product description said this was in new condition however it arrived clearly used the camera box was unsealed and loosely packed with bubble wrap and the camera itself was dirtycamera was used
2254,1,this is my  camera the first one stopped working immediately the  one work but will not connect to pc or phone in order to download pictures i downloaded xdv pro on my cell phone but it will not connect to the camera i will be returning for a refunddownloading pictures
9321,4,it is small but it works well i use this rice cooker for far more than rice and it does a nice job when i used this rice cooker exactly as directed in the instructions it worked perfectly when i cooked  or  servings of rice  to  of a cup the manufacturers interpretation of a cup vs an actual  cup are not the same the rice cookers cup is more like  of a cup when i use the rice cooker for  ounces of rice  servings the water boils over and it makes a mess however this is a little rice cooker and if i use it for just a little bit of rice it works wonderfully this new rice cooker is so much easier to use and cleaner cleaning up was a breeze too as the pot is also nonstick and it took a whole lot less effort no cleaning around a gasket the rim the vents on the top removable inner lid no boil overs etccompact
1614,1,when i received my camera it did not work at all when i tried to turn it on it would freeze on the welcome screen the only way to get off this screen was to remove and quicly reinsert the memory card while the camera was on at this point i was able to take a picture only sometimes but when i tried to view the picture it said there was no saved file half the time when i was able to get to the camera screen it would freeze there and none of the buttons would work to unfreeze it i had to actually remove the battery to turn it off because even the power button would not work overall a very frustrating experience very disappointed as i was really looking forward to this camera based on the other good reviewsdid not work
1925,1,wouldnt take any pictures at alldoesnt take pictures at all
1144,1,exactly what you would expect for the money better off buying a  kids camera the video in  is horrible audio is so muffled you cant hear anything wish the reviews i read were truehorrible camera
8582,1,the system found the camera and it worked with microsoft teams the color was off and the external light didnt work properly you tap it to come on and cycle through the levels but it wouldnt always work properly then it would start to flickerstrobe the only way to make it stop was to unplug it i tried multiple times over several days to use it and just couldnt deal with the poor quality and unpredictable lightspecs look great but dont buy itpoor quality and workmanship
5243,2,i originally ordered this in december of  then within  weeks the shutter began acting upon nonflash and auto shoot mode each shot started to develop blury on day or night shots without the flashso i sent out for an exchange and they were pretty hassle free on the replacement however the replacement cameraright out of the package was a lemon too it did not shoot properly shoot at all on any modeit kept displaying  which did absolutely nothingi had to do a master reset of the shooting mode and it worked properly for a few daysand then again randomly did the same thing but this did not properly reset the shooting mode and still displayed the errorim not sure if these refurbished or what but for over  this is ridiculous im not sure who to blame nikon or amazoneither way this is unacceptablewarning read carefully before purchasing  pretty dissapointed with this camera
5830,2,i did not research this purchase thoroughly i bought this camera for the ability to wirelessly connect to it from a smartphone to use as a flash triggerthe wireless connectivity is not there it takes decent pictures but i would have bought a different model had i known the wireless will not work properly on it also the chdk hack is not established for this model would have been better served to buy an  the buy button too quickly
6527,1,i received the product today  when i opened the box below items were missing from the  hot shoe  micro usb cableinitiated the returndid not receive the complete product usb charging cable and hot shoe head are missing
7610,1,waste of money the lights on my ceiling fan are brighterdont waste your money
1681,2,the camera video quality it like an old flip phone however the picture quality would be ideal for vintage photosbad video quality
5027,1,beyond disappointed with this camera i bought for my daughters  birthday and sadly she had a defective gift that did not work what a bummer of a birthday gift when you are so young we are returning and buying her a new camera tomorrow from somewhere more reputable absolutely would not recommend this camera or companydoes not work do not buy
8711,1,first they pay  for  star reviews a photo is on the included sd card with the offermyself and other amazon customers depend on reviews to determine what type of product were getting which is why i absolutely cant stand these sellers so no i will not delete this regardless of how many messages you send about how angry you arewhat would i expect from something like this at least for it to function poorly you wont even get that ive tried playing back on a macbook pro  smart tvs and a windows computer  all capable of avithe videos play back with sound but the screen is green and distorted its not watchable at all the weird thing is the thumbnails for the videos are clear and the still photos work  so the camera works but just does not record videowill be returning please dont buy thisupdate the company sent multiple emails demanding i delete this review then sent a follow up email which readsyou do this is unethical too disgusting you guys deliberately leave a bad review for othersand more insulting emails continue amazon please remove this seller from your platform theyre making you look badits junk  and they pay for  star reviews
4079,2,on the recommendation of my son a dentist and tech whiz i bought and installed an arlo security system in our home i have  cameras one base station and an elite membership plan ive had the system for about a year now with mixed results it does tend to pick up lots of irrelevant activitysprinklers birds trees bending in the wind etcbut i dont blame arlo for that after several months the cameras began dropping offline for no apparent reason despite having over  of their batteries remaining nonetheless i eventually replaced all of the batteries resynched all of the cameras and got the system running again which took a few hours and clambering around on a step ladder im almost  years old everything was going great as we left home for a sixweek outofstate trip we watched as our lawncare guy mowed we saw our sprinkler system go off as scheduled and so forth however on the third day of our  trip the system inexplicably crashed for no apparent reason and i quickly discovered there is no way to resurrect the arlo system remotely when that happens you are probably sol i knew our wifi router was still functional because our ring doorbell continued sending us alerts whenever there was motion near the front door and we even had a conversation with someone who rang the doorbell during our tripcontacting arlo support via email during the trip failed to produce any helpful recommendations and revealed there was probably nothing i could do until we returned home in  weeks meanwhile of course our home was unprotected support kept pinging my email address throughout the trip wanting to know the status of my problem and to me seemed more interested in protecting the products image than in offering suggestions with this system i feel im on my ownbefore i scrap the system and put it out on ebay im going to try one more thing ive ordered an arlo pro base station which reportedly has more memory and a faster processor than the original base station im using also with my elite subscription i can use up to  base stations simultaneously therefore im going to try putting my outside cameras on the arlo pro base station and place the inside cameras on the legacy arlo base station im hoping that the connectivity problem was somehow caused by overtaxing the base station with too many cameras and that this will resolve the problem if not as i indicated i will sell the system and get something that works after ive had time to test my hypothesis ill come back to this review and update my opinionso far an unreliable security system
3355,2,works ok but cant expect to much the cost was cheapmeh
9252,1,wanted to like this camera i really did at first bought for granddaughters  birthday in may took a couple of pictures they printed out well and then told my granddaughter to put it up until her vacation to her greatgrandparents she did however when she got there she tried to take a picture and it said no card even though the sd card is in the slot tried turning on then off tried removing card and reinserting it tried everything this camera will no longer take pictures too expensive for this camera to not work after second useonly worked for a short time
7865,1,the printer itself cant figure out how to print the full image ive printed over  photos and maybe  came out properly either half the image gets cut out or the printer doesnt even print the whole paper several times ive printed a photo and only half of the paper gets used and i have to either trim the paper or hope itll print right the next time  which it wont the app itself is terrible constantly glitching loosing connection with the printer process a picture for over  minutes then app closes and you have to try again to get it to print the pictures never come out to the true color either its either extremely yellow or faded with little to no color definitely not worth the money for the headache the papers arent necessarily cheap either and its annoying wasting every single one when i try to print something because it wont print properly ive even tried editing photos by adjusting the size and color but nothing works definitely not worth the moneycant print proper color or picture size
2014,1,these were both taken up close and still blurry the one with the ligt in it is odd because there was no ligt on to that side of the room i do not reccomend this camera we had one when i was a kid and it was great these new ones not so muchtakes really bad pictures
8875,1,minolta boxed set from an actual camera store comes with a memory disk specifically listed in manual as incompatible with this camera irresponsible incompetent seller refuses responsibility like how inexpensive for them to send a compatible disk especially after i added their recommended extra also incompatible diskto my purchase and contacting minolta is virtually impossible  decades of regularly buying online without such irresponsible and unnecessary resultscant review because cant use
193,1,have not taken one clear picture will returnworst

8904,2,allows me to take quick and easy professional quality photos without all of the adjusting many settings to choose from to get the quality results i require for the jobupdatewell it was good while it lasted i have had this camera for just over a year and it has stopped working since i do enjoy the quality i took it to have it repaired however it would cost more to have it repaired than the camera cost such is life  starts because of the duration it lasted just in case you are wondering never been dropped and kept in a shockproof camera bag about  pictures takeneasy professional pictures updated review
9366,5,this moosum electric rice  cooker with the onetouch for asian japanese sushi  rice is so great the  uncooked   cooked is a perfect measurement and it definitely does make our dinners a lot more convenient i dont have to worry about burning the rice or if its going to come out mushy now and the first night i used it everybody was surprised and i had to show them my secret weapon  this is a great gadget to haveits rice time

4814,1,bought and used for an anniversary party and then used one other time now film jams and wont come through wasted  packs of film and it still will not work beyond disappointed in thisbroke on  use
6135,2,there is a basic glitch in the software of this camera i have had it repaired twice so far and i guess because i have the extended warrantee i will maybe spend the shipping to get it repaired once more after taking photos and clicking on the arrow to view pictures it says file contains no data eventually the menus will change and you will not be able to change settings so disappointed in what should be a great product based on name and reputation i have had nikon in the past but this one may end my purchasing this brandmajor software glitch

6514,2,i ordered this for additional lighting for wedding receptions the light isnt strong enough to make a difference in photos and it fell off the hotshoe several times even when attached and tightened not worth the moneynot bright enough to do much
8165,1,i bought the drift xl action camera and it did not work as intended first of all a lot of noise when recording you cant even hear what is going on too much wind noise when riding camera instructions are vague and for me personally the sena cameras are the best more expensive but worth it this drift camera did not meet up to standards videos were weak and no stabilization i did not see any difference between the xl and the  cameras same video quality and no stabilization pay more and go with gopro or sena this products needs improvement and customer service is weak and dont respond to requests is going back and getting back my moneya waste of money

8561,2,i bought this camera for youtube vlogging the sound quality is terrible on video feels cheap and  plays back very shaky even when you hold the camera still not worth the money but great as a  year olds first camera its nice that it came with all the accessories but very disappointing camerabeginnerkid camera

2690,1,i get this is targeted to kids but this is ridiculously small its made for a baby but babies dont know how to use cameras i bought for my  but quickly realized its way too small also you only have a  day return policy so if you buy this beware i wanted to return it after i found a better camera for my son but i missed the window most reliable sellers on amazon dont limit returns so i was very surprised will not buy from this seller againinsanely small camera
8516,2,let me start by saying that i do like the color and design however the photo quality is quite bad even when i center the camera to take a picture the photo is not only blurry but it always moves too far to the right or too far to the left see attached photo for example this happens with every photo i takepoor photo quality
6181,2,i purchased the large cover altura for my nikon  with a tamron    camera and lens i was going to use the camera for filming my sons soccer games in rain the altura cover is well made and waterproof but it is not designed to be used while shooting photos when i insert my hand into the cover to operate my zoom ring it pulls the cover hard against the focus ring interfering with the auto focus i tried to hold the camera with my finger tips and operate the zoom ring with one finger tip but it still interferes with the focus ring i want to send it back and buy a competitors cover that has a dedicated access to the lens but i think im too late once again the cover is made of a very high quality material with a clear plastic back that did not interfere with viewing through the eye piece of the camera which is a plus there were no markings on the product to indicate what size model i have so maybe it is a small i do have large hands but so do a lot of other photographersnot enough room for hand  or fingers to operate zoom or focus ring
5315,1,update do not buy this camera my replacement camera is now showing the  lights of death and not working my daughter has been only able to use this for a few days between all of the repairs and wasting my time calling fujifilmhad it for a few months and then got the flashing orange lights of death now i have to waste my time and money sending it in to fujifilm for repair dont buy itupdated  do not buy this piece of junk
15474,4,"ive wanted a rice cooker for a while ever since a friend from thailand did a great job of convincing me that i need one in my life i can usually cook rice just fine but love the idea of just being able to set it and forget it without the need to keep checking on it to see if its ready yet make sure its not burning etc so that i can make a pot of rice and know it will be ready when i not to mention the rest of the meal am readyoverall im pretty pleased with this little rice cooker its a basic nofrills model without any of the bells whistles and assorted fancy features that more advancedexpensive models boast but it does exactly what it promises  it cooks rice all i have to worry about is making sure i add the correct volume of water for the volume of dry rice i start out with and it does the rest note  youll want to check the actual recommended ratio for the rice youre using the label on the front of the machine does show some rough guidelines but ive found i need to add a little more water than it thinks i doit doesnt have any complicated settings to consider you just put in the rinsed rice and the appropriate quantity of water put the lid on and press the cook button you can then walk away safe in the knowledge that its going to cook your rice until its ready at which point itll keep it warm until youre ready to eat it the product description says that it cooks the rice for a different amount of time depending on the type and quantity of rice but how it does that i dont know since theres just the one cook button and i cant see any sensors that would detect for example moisture so its a mystery but it seems to workthe small capacity this machine can make a maximum of six cups of cooked rice is perfect for me as its extremely rare that im cooking for more than two people and small capacity  small rice cooker so its not something that takes up a ton of space the ceramic insert is very easy to clean so far its proven completely nonstick and has barely needed more than a quick rinse out with soapy water the included plastic rice paddlescoop is a bit flimsy but itll do in a pinchit also comes with a small booklet of recipes that you can apparently cook in it although i havent tried any of these the ability to use this cooker for more than plain rice could be a useful option for a student living in a dorm room thoughin short  it does the jobgreat nofrills rice cooker"
4427,1,still pictures looked good but video was well below average software was very unstable as sometimes pictures would go through and other times its would not ios seemed to work most of the time but android was way unstable could not send pictures via email as an attachment most of the times contacted their support department and they suggested that we use their app only to send pics and video clips again this only worked sometime and was became very frustrating for the cost it was not worth the frustration so i returned the picture frameunstable software
3722,1,purchased in february  and in december  it no longer holds a charge very disappointedpurchased in february  and in december  it no longer holds a charge
8081,1,such a waste of money hardly any good pictures need a lot of light the lens filters are literally useless as it reduces light hence better not to use them please buy some other camera and save your dont buy
8308,1,my grandson loved this and could work it at  years old from other reviews i guess hes lucky he got  weeks worth of fun with it id rather pay more and get a quality productjunk
11109,4,this cooker is a great size for cooking  cup of raw rice good enough for  or two people ive also used it to heat a can of soup or cook a small amount of oatmeal and the steaming function is good as well i oft en steam brussels sprouts at the same time i am cooking rice and it works out well i have no problems with this cooker it is small but i am a household of  so it works for me and it is really convenient for a small amount of soup or other canned itemsgood size rice cooker for  or  people
14851,5,i love this rice cooker the rice is well cooked and fluffy plus it keeps it hot until you want to serve it the removable pot is very easy to clean i liked the color and the glass lid it comes with the measuring utensils and the paddle to cook i would see it to buy an excellent investmentit is very easy to usevery good
8326,1,not at all happy with this camera after  months and only using it  times it seems the memory card went bad so all the pictures taken throughout the days trip were not there for a young kid it is extremely easy delete not just  but all pictures as well can only use during bright lighttoo easy to delete
4607,2,when i got the product i followed directions how to turn it on and use it but the camera didnt want to work it was blinking and not giving any pictures it took me a while to figure it out why it wasnt working i had to search google and all that stuff finally i changed the brand new batteries to one of mines and only then it started to work i didnt expect they would send me the brand new camera with batteries that wont workbattery dont work
6133,1,using the auto function of the camera the pix did not come out clear at all i went back to my old camerausing the auto function of the camera the pix 
7553,1, month update belowi was terribly disappointed by this camera given the thousands of glowing reviews photos i took were grainy and videos skipped when replaying them ive shared sidebyside pictures from my phone and the camera to show the issues i experienced after contacting customer support they advised that the reason my pictures did not come out well is because the camera should only be used outside with good lightalso the company appears to be bribing a card was included in the shipment offering a free gift for those who leave positive reviews and clearly states do not mention or post this card in your reviewperhaps i got a defective camera but of course i returned itupdate months after returning this camera i was contacted by customer support asking if i would like a new camera to see if perhaps i got a defective one while a little suspicious i agreed i received a new camera a few weeks ago and it performed exactly as the original  not very well cs has emailed me multiple times since then asking if i would please delete or update my review i told them via email that the camera was still not worth its amazon rating but they persisted in asking that i update my review so here it is the second camera is identical to the first  low qualitypoor quality even for the low price
4433,2,this is a fine digital frame it has a great display its easy to customize and the tech support is prompt and clear the only reason for the low two star rating is that the frame can only be used in a limited way with popular external photo web sites including facebook instagram and google photo because of limitations imposed by these external sites while this is not the fault of the manufacturer i do feel the description on amazon should inform prospective customers of these limitations again other than these limitations this is a fine productminor tip replace the stock batteries on the remote it works much better with better batteriesfine frame external limitations
1937,1,the camera just flashes an orange light every time we press the button to take a picture it was a gift for my fiveyearold son and hes terribly disappointedthis will quickly find a place in the trash can if you purchase itgreat paperweight terrible camera
14852,5,i absolutely love the elite gourmet electric rice cooker its a versatile kitchen appliance that has become a musthave in my home not only does it cook rice to perfection but it also excels in making soups stews grains and hot cereals love itoh yes
10483,4,i like how compact it is but the main issue i have with it is when water boils you cannot have the lid on or it will overflowdoes not stick and is compact
3964,1,we bought the camera a few months ago started off well my daughter had a lot of fun using it after about  months the camera started flashing all the lights we changed the batteries as described in the manual and tried different batteries and its still not working complete waste of money dont buywaste of money  stopped working after a few months
2392,2,the camera was great for a couple months but then just started blinking orange all the time and wont take anymore pictures ive tried fixing it with anything google told me but nothing has worked kind of disappointed wouldnt waste your money on this would buy any other cameragood for a couple months
2614,1,this is not worth the money it works maybe every  times you try to take a pictureand thats after you turn it off between tries what a ripnot instant bc it doesnt work
14842,5,bought this especially to make rice and its worth it i dont have to worry if its done or not once i keep the rice it gets turn off automatically and save lot of my time to do other work quality is very good also good for small space kitchen it can be washed easily i also make curries and soup and its very easy to usegood rice cooker
8375,2,i printed photos from one of the packs and they all had the exact same line pattern  see the attached photo the  sheets come in  packs of  papers each i have used  other packs from this order without any problem the return window is only  days  not enough time to use up  sheets of paper so im stuck with at least  of my order being defective and no way to get a replacement pack i hope the rest of the packs dont have this issue if amazon or kodak will send me another pack ill remove this review the reason i gave the product  stars is because some of the packs have been fineat least one packet defective
3323,2,the camera took  seconds to be ready to take a picture which is way too long when youre taking pictures of kids the pictures when i zoomed in were grainy and somewhat pixelated i returned it the seller was great to work with me but the product was unsatisfactorynot happy with this camera
7612,1,i am a full time reseller and i bought these to take photos of the products for my online store these just did not produce the appropriate light needed for the photos disappointed so i returned themthese just dont produce enough light for what i need
159,2,camera came with no cables no accessories at all not being able to connect an external mic really pisses me off to no end i waste my money on this and will have to eat this cost as it is useless for my video productionmy bad that i did not research this product better i wont make that mistake againnot happy with the product
291,1,this camera has the worst picture quality i have ever seen so disappointedworst picture quality
5138,1,i dislike how the video quality on  was absolutely horrible id rather just stick to using my phone not gonna liequality is horrible no matter what
2723,1,poor picture quality i liked nothing about itdoesnt take good pictures
5040,1,i did not like it because i was not able to take picturesthis product did not work and i was not able to take pictures with this camera
2651,2,we literally thought we got scammed and sent the wrong thing its  inches  we thought it was a joke its def going backthis thing looks like a mcdonalds toy
4325,1,bought this camera bag for a  day vacation to disney world carried a light canon  mirrorless  panckace lense and the kit lens also a granola bar and cheap disposable rain poncho first day before we even went to the parks the top handle grip ripped off  day at the park the strap ripped and was barely hanging on i had to go to the gift shop at the resort and buy a  sewing kit to fix it every night i would have to sew it to keep it from falling apart not what i want to do on vacation every day another part would rip worst bag ever i wish i could give it negative stars now that i am home it will make a nice addition to the local landfill pure junkpure garbage regret buying it
10453,5,"i love rice but have never mastered how to cook it in a pot the normal way ive had multiple people show me how and tell me its so easy to cook rice in a regular pot but we clearly have different definitionns of easy or i just have some secret skill that makes me fail at cooking rice in a pot i resorted to the boilinabag kind of rice because that was the only way i could get it cooked properly without it burnt to the bottom and crunchy and the mushy in other spotsthen enter this rice maker i followed their instructions and filled their measuring cup with rice up to the line added it to the pot with some salt and then filled their measuring cup all the way with water dumped it in and pressed the cook button i did not rinse the rice no one in my family does and i had no idea it was even a thing its never affected how my rice cooks so i dont intend to start doing so eitheri did expect it to take less time initiallynot sure why but when it did flip from cook to warm and i checked the rice it was done perfectly nothing burned to the pan no mushy spots just fully cooked delicious rice ive followed the same procedure every time and gotten basically perfect rice every time if you dont get to the pot right away the rice will start to get a bit brown on the bottom and cook together a bit but when you add butter and other food to the rice ive never noticed a burnt or bad taste just that its a bit more stuck together than usuali have had a few occasions where it did start to boil over and thats generally when i accidentally spilled water when adding it to the pot and guestimated how much i split and probably added more than it needed otherwise ive never had it boil over or make much of a mess at all maybe beyond a few splatters which is much less mess than i ever got making rice in the stove where it would constant boil over so i have no issues with the occasional splatter its cookingtheres sometimes a messthats just how it goes regardless of whether it boils over or not its super easy to clean i just use a dishcloth and soapy water and any starch or other residue comes off quickly and easily again far less time spent cleaning the cooker pot than i would spend cleaning an actual pot of rice were i to attempt to do so so i have no quarrels with that either i just make sure to plug it in some place that isnt right next to something i dont want accidental rice water on textbook alexa phone etcive should note ive only ever cooked rice in it despite owning it for years gluten free noodles take forever to cook on the stove in general and since i tend to make a big batch at once using the dash for noodles just hasnt made sense and i dont eat oatmeal all that often nor quinoa or other such things despite being basically a one function appliance for me im perfectly happy with it because i can finally have good rice whenever i want and not the stuff boiled in a bag also ive used this in multiple places throughout the country and have never had to change my regular procedure much if at all granted ive never cooked rice at a super high altitude so maybe that would require alterations to my processaside from cooking rice perfectly the dash rice cooker just looks cute mine is red to match my other kitchen appliances and decoraccent colors and even when i had a microscopic kitchen the thing as hardly a concern because its so small that it doesnt take much counterr space when using it nor much space to store it thoughonce you buy the cute little dash rice maker you might end up with their little waffle maker and a few other dash appliances so storage space may eventually become a concernif youre second guessing buying the dash rice maker id just go for it it might take some experimentation to get enough water to cook rice but not boil over everywherebut having tried to scrub boiled on stains and gunk from the stove from a regular pot of rice that boiled over cleaning up after the dash is still far easier and quickerplus its basically set and forget once you figure out the timing for the pot of rice to cook its easy enough to ask alexa to tell you to check the rice in x minutes and then you wont have to hover around waiting for the switch to flip over to warm or nervously stare at the pot and hope it turns out okay you get  servings of delicious and perfectly cooked rice depending on if your serving size is eating all the rice you cooked or saving half of it for very little effort and monitoring and can focus on the rest of your mealor netflix no judgement hereamazing rice cooker"
4624,2,works but if you have a hard case on your phone youll have to buy an extension adapter to use this thing you would have thought they would have figured this out and actually told their customersworksbut
8175,1,microphone cable hangs straight down from bottom of camera leaving it exposed and easily damaged cable needs to have a  degree bend as it exits the camera but stupidly hangs straight downi emailed drift support from their web site and after  attempts and no replies to get a new microphone cable im sending it back the threaded design of the  mm cable prevents regular michrphone cables from working with this camera google searches for a new cable turned up empty what a waste of a camera and of a companydefective cable for michrophone no factory support
6198,2,nikon  its sooooo frustrating its as if they assumed you would have a massive lens on your camera at all times everything is baggy and it feels awkward to work with i will say that it seems to keep the water out i just felt that while i was out taking pictures i spent more time trying to keep the collar on the lens than i did actually taking pictures from what i see on here people seem to enjoy it for the most part i cant completely dismiss the idea that maybe im just putting it on wrong but the little leaflet directions they send with the product dont do much in terms of clearing any of the mysteries of this thing ill update my rating if i figure something out that i missed but if this is as good as it gets yould do just as well using a ziplock bag with a hole in the corner and a rubber bandi wish it fit better
5518,2,i am an experienced photographer and looked for a camera with long zoom main reason to not to lug around different lenses product has manual features to adjust the exposure and iso however the result from the camera is very poor in lesser than normal light quite disappointed i spend  dollars on a product that did not meet my needs it is definitely not a supplement to anyone looking to have an alternate to a dslr it is just a point and shoot travel product like any other point and shoot attached couple of pictures straight out from camera one of them is at high zoom  on an evening light and i am not happy with the resultworks only in a perfect light condition
2484,1,this camera does not come with a cable to download your pictures  after trying to find a cable that would work with no luck i sent this crappy camera back  dont waste your money  on this awful camera it takes really awful picturesdo not buy this camera 
8213,1,bought to use as a dashcam for commute on motorbike but the image quality in anything less than bright sunshine or very bright street lights at night is too dark and grainy to make out number plates even under ideal conditions unless the plate is directly in front and less than a couple of car lengths away they are unreadable and i have tried every setting to try and improve thisthe biggest failure though is that despite being clearly advertised as waterproof to a depth of  water has found its way inside on every wet ride fogging up the lens and getting into the sd card slotusb port and if you contact drift customer support they will immediately point out that water ingress is not covered by their warranty so tough lucklots of silicone grease around the card slotusb cover and all the seams has reduced this but water still finds a way in eventuallyit did come back to life after drying out but the camera is now dead it powers up and appears to record but it corrupts any sd card that is installed also it will no longer connect via usb i suspect that water ingress has finally killed itto summarise dont waste your money on this rubbish you can get a gopro hero  for the same price 
3990,1,the camara does not work at all unfortunately i didnt check when i received because i reserved for my daughter as a gift now i gave her but wasnt workcamera doesnt work
13942,5,this cooker is easy to use the rice comes out perfect and cleanup is very easy figuring correct quantity of rice takes some trial and error but overall i highly recommendoutstanding cooker
1152,1,i wanted to get this for a christmas present but after a few test photos the quality is not what is described or what people boast about this is not an item worth getting the photos on a phone now are better then this these are about as good as an old flip phonedo not buy
1162,1,not  footage looks like it was filmed by a potatothis is the worst camera ever
3875,1,couldnt charge battery brand new out of the box maybe its the charger or maybe its the battery waiting on amazon to resolve it it hasnt been as smooth as other returns because item is over  use the camera and return is not going smoothly
15465,5,"when i was in the market for a new rice cooker i wanted something versatile that was easy to clean and this does just thatprosversatility  you can use it for more than just rice ive made cake oatmeal and soup successfully with it and i cant wait to try out its other functionscooks evenly  its given me perfect rice every time not too wet not too dry no boiling over or burnt rice to the bottomclean up  its incredibly easy to clean the pot is nonstick and food doesnt adhere to the bottom not easily anyway and even if it does it scrubs right off with a bit of warm water and soap you can also remove the vent and dry up the water behind it which i appreciatecons the directions arent very clear in regards to how to use it if youre familiar with rice cookers you can eventually figure it out after playing with it but for someone whos new to them its kind of vagueafter two months of use i highly recommend thisperfect rice every time"
4806,1,ordered this product as a christmas presentopening it up was great my daughter was ecstatic  it worked for  picturesthen completely stopped workingwe tried everything changing the film changing batteries making sure everything was correct  it just will not workabsolutely returningdo not waste your moneycamera doesnt work
540,1,this device never worked right  it would not focus the settings would just keep changing it real hard to focus the settings dont do what its suppose to doit eats batteries up very fast including lithiumi urge you not to by this camera do not by
7711,2,camera pictures were good but the camera was too complex for my  year old niece doesnt want to use it has many features but difficult to access some of the features documentation was very poor and downloading pictures to pc was not easy for an adultconsider other camera makes for young children under   yo
3505,2,ok i expected a small pocket size camera as described but i have average size hands and fingers with good dexterity and there was no comfortable way to operate this camera the buttons are not only far too many but way too small to operate the reviews claim easy to use hah the sd card had to be inserted by using a tool to push it all the way in the battery also required extra effort worst of all whatever they are calling the flash it isnt one my test shots were just like if no extra light was used at all i suppose kids fingers would work fine and im sure the kids of today are smart enough to work the thing but i have a  year old  camera that has easy to operate buttons great flash and nice photos guess ill stick with the old school camera for the rest of my daysitem appears smaller in rear view mirror
5888,1,i enjoyed it while it lasted a few months later and the rechargeable battery no longer takes a chargeit no longer takes a charge
4691,1,does not fit my  ultra with the case on the tab prevents it from plugging into the phoneredesign
8170,1,i bike in the city and record my bike rides in case i get in an accident this camera has historically lost recordings id finish recording and the camera would indicate it had saved the recording but i couldnt find the recording afterwards theres around a  success rate today i was in an accident and would have loved to have it recorded unfortunately the camera lost the recording dont get thiscant be relied on to save video
6644,2,the product would not sync with a smart device as advertiseddoesnt sync
5122,1,it looks like a nice camera  but it takes terrible pictures for every one decent picture it takes three blurry picturesterrible
8670,1,super disappointed that it came damaged was really looking forward to it but the box was all ripped open for some reason i cant even test the camera out because the bottom doesnt open at all so i cant input a battery or sd cardcame damaged
946,1,i could not preview a video i followed the manual turn dial mode to video  press shutter to start recording  press shutter to stop recording  the manual says to press preview button to preview video but it did not worki wanted to rerplace but my only option was to return the reason i could not replace because the price was increased by  my only option was to return upset when you get a defective item you should be able t replace it if that is what you want regardless of price increase i was even willing to pay the  if they sent a replacement but no go instead i have to pack it up and return get a refund and buy again returns are a pain so if i can avoid i will but in this case i did not have the option to replace too badcould not replace
937,1,not many features poor quality connectionspoor quality picture and too much buffering
11102,4,very basic rice cookereasy to clean does not occupy much space with a bonus steamereasy to clean
5887,2,i really wanted to like this camera i loved the idea of the old polaroid pictures and how compact it was compared to other brands sadly the photo quality of the prints are awful at best i was so disappointed my phone corrected these examples when i took this so the actual images are even worse  oi know this is not a professional camera but i was at least expecting images that you could see even using the flash less than  away did not help overall i would recommend this but only for very bright outdoors settings but if you wanted to use this for any indoor situation i would look elsewhere or just use your phone maybe this a defective product  othe example photos are very deceiving
1364,1,great camera when it works it overheats and shuts down quicklyoverheats and shuts off
6872,1,doesnt turn on no matter how much its charged the only thing it will show is msdc and the screen is offcentered im really upset it didnt work but i dont recommendcamera came broken
2806,2,really terrible quality the flash is just a flashlight that you turn on and its very dim i tried taking a flash photo in the dark and it made the photo grey its great for kids but dont get it if you are buying for aesthetic purposeslike taking a picture with a calculator
6625,2,i have read up on how to use this camera and tried many different things but always get blurry pictures unless there is lots of light yes i have manually changed settings etcit does not take good pictures consistently especially for a point and shootit does not take good pictures consistently
8882,2,went to germany got there  day tried taking pictures and after  one something broke and camera only says remove lens coverwould not recommend
4294,2,i was looking forward to this bag it was received on time and in good condition the product seemed well made and of good quality however i couldnt figure out how to wear it and when i finally did it was very awkward to put on im not as flexible as i use to be and it was hard to put my arm behind my back to grab it i could not sling it around to the front at all i had to pull my right arm out so that it was just secured around my waist by the waist strap that made it extremely uncomfortable with it riding across my bust i have a small tripod and theres no way it would fit in the loop for it i could barely put four fingers into it i returned this bag and would not recommend itdoesnt sling around to the front
3187,1,i used these sandbags  times then one strap broke on the  time carrying thembroke early
1155,1,clarity was not that clear and not able to do the zoom couple of buttons didnt work so had to return itnot up to the mark
4774,1,i just got it delivered today  it doesnt even work it came dead  the charger dont even fit  its not even charging im pissed i need my money backdont buy
13413,5,i specifically bought this model because its been used in my vietnamese side of the family for over  years and makes the perfect consistency and quality of rice every single time just follow the instructions for the  ration of rice and water hit cook and wait  minutes then fluff and season and youre done and please for the love of god wash your rice this rice cooker is an absolute need for anyone who cooks large amounts of rice at home even has a warming setting bless this brand theyll forever be a staple in my kitchen unless you get water in the heating element in the bottom it will work for  years without fail thank you amazon and zojirushi we love your product and will enjoy it foreverbest rice cooker of all time
718,2,missing sd card kinda disappointedmissing sd card
2001,2,the camera itself is nice lightweight and easy to usethe problem comes with the film qualitythe itype film seems to be just plain too dark for any good picture taking outside of a studio level lighting set upi took  separate pictures to confirm i wasnt doing something wrongits good but for the quality it really should be half the pricei was hoping to use it for vintage cosplays and a romantic picture with my gf but the sheer darkness makes it unlikely to have any quality pictureif the itype films have brighter images after development time days  wait last image i took i waited  hours just as dark would be way bettergood but
4595,1,we only received camera accessories despite description that camera is included worst birthday gift given everbuyer beware
9086,2,the film has a noticeable yellow vintage look thats the good thing if youre into that i am what im not thrilled with is the variation of photos the pictures ive included are all same day two inside and two outside itype film purchased locally and stored in the refrigerator is my go to i wanted to love this purchase because of the price i wouldnt recommendnot the same quality as local film stock
7179,2,the concept is a good idea but it doesnt rwally work out well you have to snap buttons around your wrist eveytine you want to remove your hand from the camera or but it back the process is not smooth either and the buttons dont feel extremely solid if you show up to a shoot with this thing and are fumbling around with it everytime you want to move your hand youre going to look pretty unprofessionalnot very practical
6591,1,ive been using nikon cameras since the late  this  was purchased only to use in an environment where i could not take my professional nikon cameras so i wanted to ensure i bought in my opinion the best im a commercial photographer and take thousands of photos every week on my photo projects this unfortunately is by far the worst nikon camera ive ever used in my life i would not recommend it at all ill be returning it i cringe at the photo quality and no matter how much i try to dress it up in photoshop  lightroom for this miniproject its difficult to tweak them into an acceptable mode the camera was extremely slow to use and focus time wise it would take me three times longer to frame and take a photo very disturbing that nikon sells this productused nikon cameras since the late  but this one is the worst
14730,5,"so i bought this rice cooker one night when i was really drunk because i was watching the price and finally saw it at a price i was willing to pay i am sooo glad i did sometimes i only have two hours in between school and work and dont have much time to wait on rice to cook for an hour it has a turbo cook option which can take about  minutes and even has a nice warming functionit was a really good buy because youre not just limited to cooking rice in it theres many other options for cooking and im really impressed with this rice cooker you wont regret purchasinga game changer"
1143,1,while the images and video are technically high resolution the actual dpi on these images is aweful its like they are taking  images and blowing them up to  even with daylight the images are dark and fuzzy not true hd buyer beware im asking for a refund nowi didnt keep it long enough to judge the battery life or the zoom quality after seeing my first test images i didnt need to bother furthernot  video and poor image quatity
3039,1,does not work with card that was provided inserted unhappy not worth the moneydoes not read memory card
5561,2,seems very basic and the poor quality pictures made me sadvery basic and subpar quality as well as pictures
5947,1,wouldnt buy product in photo shows that theres picture frames album book camera case n more but when received package all that came was like  frames some batteries and camera where are the stickers the frames the markers n so on this is false advertisingdont buy
6515,1,these lights barely last an hour which makes me nervous every time i use these as i dont know if they will shut off during a webinar they take a long time to charge fully so you have to plan ahead to use them for the full hour i would not recommendthe battery life on this is not great

8793,1,this camera is no doubt the cutest but after the photos i took i cant even recommend it i was extremely disappointed because you truly want to love it every single photo was completely too dark and you cant adjust lightendarken even outdoor photos were dark and out of focus not one photo came close to even acceptable i have used polaroid products since the swinger came out when i was a kid it is regrettable that they did such a good job of design and overlooked the basic purpose to produce a useable memory in time one that you can actually see returningcute design unusable photos good paperweight

5062,1,bought this for my daughters birthday she was so excited to have an old school camera but became disappointed when the shutter button fell off and the camera stopped working all together after  month great bundle but would be better if the camera lasted longergreat bundle price lacks craftsmanship
8743,2,i bought this for valentines day for my wife and my  year old daughter so they could bond and have instant pictures it finally came and im disappointed that it comes with a micro usb when i buy certain products like samsung sony etc ive come to expect quality for the money i pay apparently not polaroid i thought i read through the specs well enough and was like theres no way theyll use a micro usb and it makes me question the rest of the build quality not only did they charge  for tech that two decades ago was  specialized film that costs more than the camera after a few uses but im wondering after that usb is trashed if it will even work i gave it two stars for the benefit of the doubtmicro usb

6952,1,we bought this camera for the photo area of our daughters wedding it gave us pictures while it was light but as soon as it was dark all we got were black pictures the flash wouldnt work even the indicator showed the flash was on we had  people that own the same camera come over and try to get it to work but couldnt we bought props and they hardly were used because there wasnt a camera it was very disheartening to not have fun pictures for guests to take home or put on a scrapbook page to leave a note for the bride and groom all that planning and we ended up with a defective camera  soif you get it test it out at night to make sure the flash worksdisappointing camera

7348,2,i had really high hopes for this maybe an expert could make better use than i could but it wasnt useable in my experience its hard to get the image to the right size for what youre doing even if you can the holder is not steady enough for the image to stay in the right spothard to get the image to the right size and not steady enough to use
7485,2,now i know i shouldnt have expected gopro level quality from such a cheap camera but when i read in the description that it is  i naturally believed it because why would the seller lie right well its not  the image quality is decent but the video at  is atrocious its a grainy video i understand its cheap for a reason and that the quality will be low but the seller is misleading people by saying that the video quality is  because its definitely not at least not for me so maybe i got a defective device i will end up keeping it because its okay for my needs but otherwise i would return itdefinitely not

11926,5,i like everything about this rice cooker i went through the cheaper ones at walmart and this one is actually holding up ive put about  lbs of rice through it it is on  the non stick coding is not peeling off i also have cooked corn  on the cob in it as well as steamed veggies in it toobest rice cooker
9461,4,this is a decent rice cooker but has two design flaws first the warming feature is on as soon as you plug it in and after the rice is cooked rice may dry out if left standing with the unit plugged in you must unplug the unit to really turn it off second my other rice cooker had a handle with a slot that acted to hold the serving paddle this unit does not have this feature the paddle must be put on a spoon rest to keep it clean it will take some more time to find out if the nonstick coating lastsworks well but pay attention
8551,2,i expected this to take much better pictures than the cheaper instax models it doesnt really no advantage at all over the regular ones i dont know what the heck youre supposed to be paying so much more fordisappointing
7810,1,i received this album bent on both sides the box was ok i definitely expected better quality very disappointingreceived damaged album

5121,2,the picture quality inside is terrible but when you are outside in the sunlight it looks greatbad quality
17595,5,"i had the previous model for this which looks exactly the same with the same dimensions except the older version had off white trim instead of black trim my previous rice cooker lasted  years and cooked every kind of rice to perfection up until it was killed by my house keeper last week after she put too much water and it overflowed into the heating chamber and shorted it out i was sad as it was pricey to replace but was glad that they made a near identical model more than  years later so i ordered it and it just arrived today it looks near identical except for the mentioned black trim i was able to set aside the old cooking pot lid spatula holder and steam vent from the older rice cooker just to save for spare parts for the newer one just in case as all the old parts fit perfectly in the new rice cooker i just cooked my first pot of nikishi brand white rice and it cooked it to perfection just like my old rice cooker hopefully this one will last me as long as my previous zojirushi which in my opinion is the best rice cooker brand out there because it is reliable and lasted me close to  decadeswhat sets this rice cooker apart from other brands is that once you cool and put left over rice in the fridge when the rice is reheated even days later the rice is perfectly moist like it is a fresh batch of ricethis is definite worth paying top dollar for you cant go wrong with this rice cookertried and true"
1368,2,this is not a  camera its an improvement over their older model but not at  plus price tagnot worth the premium pricing
16967,5,this slow cooker is the bomb you can use it on the stove top to brown your meat it is easy to clean and made of heavy duty quality materials i am one happy customerbest slow cooker ever

8392,1,so i cant tell if its the quality of the print paper or is it the camera its a kodak camera or is it both the photos have what was printed i am thinking its a waste of moneyand looking at the ads for the camera the photo shoot look great but the ones i got have are not very good at all look at the camera kodak printomatic digital instant print camera and youll see what im talking about in the ad waste of money you know yeahfilm or camera
8716,1,first of all i returned this product on april  it is no may  and i still have not received my refund second thing is it does not have wifi thats why i returned itno refund
1452,1,on the first try to use this so called camera it would not stay on longer than six minutes while using three sets of brand new batteries what a sad joke this cheaply made piece of plastic is additionally i will lose  for the sd card and return sh costs so i am out  for trying to buy a camera to take some photosplease dont waste your time or money on this inferior product
14885,4,"i submitted a request for a replacement and it was super easy  they sent me a replacement right away and gave me up to like  days to return the original onethe good it was super easy to return the bad one and they sent me a new one within a couple of days before the original one was even in the mail they gave me  days to return it thanks for someone with a busy schedule thats a decent window of time to allow for a return its super straightforward and easy to operate its pretty impossible to make a mistake using this thingthe bad the first one they sent me turned on for  seconds and then cut off  i had to make rice using the old school method that night in a pot boohoo tears first world problems i know if you do more than one cup of rice at a time it always bubbles over and makes a mess thats probably my biggest issue with this thing being so small is that you cant really make more than a cup of rice in it unless you want to be cleaning up a mess bigger than just the rice bowl and lidoverallin general its nice i like it its super cheap and convenient when making a couple of dishes of foodcooking rice for more than  people not so much  unless you want to clean up a bigger mess from all the sticky rice water that splashes out of the lids vent youre better off going with a slightly pricier rice maker unless youre absolutely on a budget and dont mind cleaning up a splash mess after every time you use itthe first one they sent me turned on for about  seconds and then died"
4586,1,just received today and tried using it the light will stay on when i first turn it on but as soon as i press the shutter button it starts blinking like crazy batteries are in correctly film is in correctly i even had to use both sets of film to see if it would help but nothingbroken

1480,1,it does not work hard to turn on piece of garbage dont waste your moneynot worth the money
10519,5,not only does this cute little rice cooker easy to use it makes great rice the rice is so much better i had bought a rice cooker years ago i love this appliancewish i had bought this sooner
1897,2,the only issue i had with this bundle was the damaged film the bundle included  boxes of film  pictures well out of the  pictures my daughter was only able to take  pictures the rest of the film was damaged it was kind of a christmas gift let downgreat camera film not great
4978,1,i purchased this for my daughter for christmas the camera has been in her bedroom and not used very often however when we went to change the battery it came with it was corroded and the camera no longer works she had thought it was just out of film but now were both very disappointed she can no longer use her camera that she had wanted for so longdisappointed
8311,1,horrible picture quality eve in a fully lit room its a toy at best for a  year old probably only worth about  waste of moneyits a toy
8956,1,i love the camera butfirst time it broke in six months second time two months later then i sent it in they never heard of me after telling me they were sending me a new one ill be surprised if this outcome is good minolta not what it used to be
391,2,i dont like the camera at all its very unclear and its not up to my standardsthis most definitely an scam
1799,2,this is our second kids love it but it is finickyits ok
1466,1,wont hold a charge brand new batteries lasted about  min i know its a cheap camera but its pretty disappointing would have rather spent another  and got something my kids could actually usenot worth it
8726,1,this product has  stars here but if you google it it has horrible ratings it is difficult if not impossible to program offers littlevery limited support and directions are poorly written for english language people there is no helpful programming support on youtube or other avenuesoverpriced for basically non working device everything is made of cheap plastic and the micro sd card once purchased is extremely difficult to installextremely difficult to install poor quality

9329,4,"you can purchase rice cookers with many more features than this one however it would be difficult to find a rice cooker that is simpler to useyou wont find any presets on this device you only get two simple controls keep warm and cook for people experienced at cooking rice this is all you will need for beginners you may have to experiment a little in order to figure out the timing which will depend on the quantity of rice you are cookingthe keep warm setting is useful and keeps your food pretty hotconsidering that this unit is only about  i recommend it however just be advised that this unit cooks the rice and keeps it warm but lacks many of the features and presets of more expensive units "
8181,1,picture quality is poor was better at  than it was at  and it really needs image stabilization used it on a couple of bike rides on paved roads and the vibration made the footage useless returned it and am going to try a different brand that has eisneeds image stabilization
2450,2,in my opinion made with inferior materials while trying to screw the camera into my universal tripod yes i was being careful the plastic around the screw broke apart from the camera additionally certain features that i wanted it didnt have buti guess that is why it is priced so low sighwished that i could have returned it
5803,1,i am not going to comment on the cheap parts  i didnt pay for some bells and whistles i normally would because i wanted an inexpensive camera that could be used in a finish room and a wood shop  so the accidents possible are rampant and who pays big bucks for that but this is a bad camera the settings dont work i just did  different settings to see how the camera reacted so i coudl choose the best one for the lighting we usually use and the fact is they were all overexposed so canons are off my list because the price of the point and shoot should include functions it offers actually working i show two images below one on the brightest setting and the other on the darkest wow  can you see the difference i thot nota bad camera
1941,1,i had previously been using an instax mini  but accidentally broke it and bought this one as a replacement all the photos come out with smudges the lighting looked bad even though its the same lighting ive used for hundreds of other polaroids and the lines arent crisp it looks like youre seeing double and nothing is in focus its not the film itself the film is fine and i bought more film and those are fine ive wasted  polaroid films trying to take one photo stay away from this model of instax i highly recommend the mini  with the mini  you have the option to change the camera setting depending on the lighting with the lenseget the insax mini  instead
5889,2,the camera frequently forgets to save images to my sd card it takes an awkward amount of time to boot up the print quality is mediocre and god help you if some dirt gets stuck in the bodywhat attracted me to this camera was the ability so save images digitally rather than print them just once im thinking now i would have been better off with a polaroidnot awful but far from great
2390,2,the best thing about this camera is the retro look and ease of operationit took me several tries to figure out how to use the selfie mode once the lens is open pull up on lens use the mirror on the lens to frameprosinstant photos that you can give awayeasy to usecool lookingconsif you shoot too close the image is blurryno controls except shutter buttonno way to turn off flashexpensive filmframing through the viewfinder not exactno lcd screenmakes every photo look like it came from a toy cameraa cell phone photo is much better than this i see the only true upside is that you have a physical photo in hand in secondsquality poor
8823,1,the camera looks like the old polaroids the picture quality is very poorpoor quality pictures
1111,2,the picture quality is extremely lacking i took the same photos with this camera and with my phone my phone was  better i do not recommend the cameranot great phone takes better photos
4909,1,i just got this camera and used it snorkeling yesterday and loved it today i went diving and the camera turned off after i took a few pictures at about  feet depth it would not turn back on and after a few minutes i saw water inside the viewing screen i never even went to  feet during the whole dive heartbroken as it happend on day two of my  day island vacationnot waterproof even at  feet

1076,1,cheaper is definitely not better in this case i bought this camera as a first camera for my  old grandson as a christmas gift i tested the camera after he opened the package i took  photos and one short video all  photos were grainy and the video was choppy some of the photos were of nonmoving objects a couple were of people moving the subject matter didnt make any difference the quality of the photos was horrible if my grandsons first camera doesnt take photos that inspire him to take more photos whats the point im not looking for professional photographerquality pictures but come on these quality of photos from this camera is ridiculously poor i posted a few of the pictures as examples i hope you heed my words and dont buy this cameradont waste your money
6202,1,this waterproof bag ruined my camera i thought it was great at first but after just  waterfall in iceland on day  of  my camera started malfunctioning and had an internal mechanical error the only way to fix this was a  repair by a canon dealer ended up not having the camera for the rest of my trip and it was a brand new camera  only  months old sending this bag back the  it cost me wont fix my camera but hopefully this review will warn others to not purchasedonotbuythis
2082,1,this set did not come with all the components moreover the box isnt large enough to fit everything it is supposed to come with which makes me wonder if this was intentional and not merely an oversight id be cautious about making this purchasepackage does not include the promised accessories

7756,2,its okay but my granddaughter really was disappointed with itcamera for granddaughter
6925,2,this camera should be more fun to use but it just gets frustrating when none of the pictures come out looking very good at all my daughter has a basic instax camera that gets much better results than this one the problem here is trying to add more things brings the usability down there is an option to change the zoom which basically tells you to use one setting if the object is so far away or the other if not and it feels like each time you have made the wrong choicewe also used one of these at a wedding we went to the bride and groom set this out with a photo wall and asked guests to have fun take pics with the device and leave the photos out for others to enjoy no one seemed to really grasp the concept of how to use this camera or have it take an acceptable picture the piles of pics left behind were all not very goodi would recommend going for a simple instax camera insteadshould be more fun instead its just frustrating
99,1,i received the camera read the manual charged it and then turned it on only to find out that there is no autofocus and no way to focus anything at all by  autofocus is an assumed feature of any digital camera after reading the descriptions about the product on amazon i find no mention at all that there is not an autofocus and the first several reviews that most people are going to read also fail to mention this clearly this camera is sold as a money grab to unsuspecting customers even for a kid and should be considered a scamno autofocus or any apparent focus at all
4700,1,i got this card reader to use with my phone so that i can use an sd card and get it to read data from phone but unfortunately this wont work with any of my phones or ipad seller email system is down as wellusb c port with  a d  wont work
7476,2,i really wanted to like this  pro but cant seem to get it to stay on the weird part is im able to record about an hours long video when i just have it on my desk but it cuts at around  and then records on its own a separate  clip until the battery dies out but heres the thing i cant seem to get it to stay on when i mount it to my motorcycle from what i could tell it stayed on for at least  as i saw the recording light on top of the camera blinking but by the time i finished my  min ride i noticed it was off and none of the footage was captured upon further testing and recording at my desk i noticed that its very inconsistent on saving footage when the battery is going low and dies out for instance i just tried recording a  clip and noticed the battery level dropping until it eventually died and non of my footage was saved i also noticed that i have to keep setting the datetime so i just turned off time stamps instead i tried calling their customer support but they have long wait times and wasnt able to get through hopefully someone contacts me back after this review and ill be sure to update it if i can be provided a working productkeeps turning off
5493,2,the range finder is pretty much worthless so telephoto becomes almost impossible to use using the screen to aim the camera is also impossible because ambient light reflects off of the screen and blocks the image this camera is expensive enough to have better performance if you plan to use the telephoto capabilities this is not the camera for youvery difficult to frame shots
10500,5,i have named him rico and i love him i can get it started on break and have lunch or dinner ready with basically zero effort instructions include ratios for other grains other than white ricei have named him rico and i love him
8994,1,i saw another review stating that their dial was broken and they couldnt change the settings resulting in blank photos my camera has the same issue and its too late to be returned took me a while to figure out why most my photos would print blank its really a shame for  dial
8164,1,bought this may   and it worked on one cycling ride on my second ride the camera recorded  of the ride then left out the last two five minute segments and recorded  seconds of the last segment so i did a reset reloaded the firmware and tried a smaller   gb card to no avail it actually got worse the camera would power up and stay on for  minutes and then shut down i powered up again and the length of time it would stay on got shorter and shorter i have sent several email support requests to drift innovations and their response has been almost nonexistent fortunately i did not buy from them but from amazon so easy to return customer beware junk
2102,1,got the camera and it wouldnt change functions from the house flash always went off which destroyed lots of picx and when i sent an inquiry into seller they just told me to return it if you are ok with meh photos and happy to get all of the extra fluff with a polaroid camera get this if you wanted say maternity pics in the mirror or any pics that dont need a flash or if you wanted even an answer no the flash will always engage then look for a better optionlots of fluff for a not so awesome product
2280,1,camera quality was great but broke two days after having it wouldnt turn on or chargebroke  days after purchase
3671,2,light is awesome really is but the shoe mount broke evidently i overtightened the shoe nut on to the camera and bent the plastic piece that slides on to the hot shoe no problem ill order a new mount right nope viltrox doesnt sell replacement mounts so youll need to buy the entire light again sounds a little scammy to melight is great shoe mount stinks
6627,1,camera is currently incompatible with apple iphone somebody goofed big time spent  hours christmas evening trying to connect  no luck called support next day  they said would be fixed in week its been a week and a dayat least the app fesses up now and says theres a problem come ondont you know your softwaredoesnt work with iphone
2217,2,the box is solid high quality everything however the most important part the lighting is awful wayyy too bright with no way to adjust take a picture of something metallic forget itpremium price quality everything except what matters most lighting
9255,1,the worst camera ive ever used the photo quality is worse than a flip phone it doesnt focus it feels like a flimsy box of cheap plastic no stabilization at alli could go on but i hope at this point you have decided not to get itworst camera ive ever used
5013,1,play video how can i claim a warranty in the philippines the red light keep blinking and do not take a picture even when i changed the battery i am using new alkaline battery but still blinking red light i also double check and changed the film still not taking a picturebought on november  but the red light keep blinking

11211,5,"i loved this rice cooker for making my favorite rice recipes and it cooks well enough for me my husband and my teenage sonhowever i soon discovered that when you have the pot full of rice and water and you need to press the button to go from warm to cook you may end up with it on your lapi got really lucky and the lid stayed on and only let out maybe a quarter cup of hot liquid on methe cooker has  legs and should have  or maybe even  legs very disappointed that i now have to watch myself and dont treat it like a crockpot and use one hand on the handle and one on the switch my husband who is the main cook here told me that hes not a fan and to find something else thats more safevery good but a safety hazard"
138,1,these pictures are terrible i figured a camera didnt have that be amazing for my  year old hes  but its too crappy even for himpoor quality
7238,2,since i bought this about a year and a half ago it was used twice a day almost every day for my bicycle commute to work i kept it in the waterproof case mounted to my helmet the weight is there but not really noticeable having to remember the camera is there when dodging tree branches and truck mirrors was worse than the added weightvideo quality was good other than wind noise sound quality was surprisingly good given that i kept it in the waterproof case at all timeseasy to use easy to connect to your phone or computer and watch or download videos and generally all around solid product while it lasted never had a single complaint that couldnt be easily addressed by changing a setting i would have gladly continued to use it for several more years but it died without apparent cause or warning that maybe would be ok if it was six years old or had been heavily abused but it was only a year and a half old and lived on top of a bicycle helmettwo stars because i liked it while it worked but clearly does not have the durabilitylongevity to be used longterm unless youre a professional used to upgrading or replacing equipment every year anyway id avoid this productworked great but died without cause or warning
17602,4,this rice cooker cooks rice fluffy soft and tasty as japanese prefer we may want a bit harder but this is a matter of preference you can always adjust water level or choose cooking choices this cooker provides its pot is thick and sturdy and easy to clean recommendedrecommended
14769,5,this is a great little rice cooker cooks fast keeps rice warm for days looks great in the kitchennice unit
6438,2,the camera is only  at a very low frame rate dont buy expecting hd video additionally the battery life is not amazing and the controls have been a bit unreliable freeze ups occurmisleading product information
4349,1,we bought this in december we took it on two trips since purchasing it so it was actually only used in the field for a total of  days we noticed last week during our second trip that the stitching was coming loose in an area about  inches long on a zipper seam i spent an hour using my travel sewing kit to repair the seam so the camera couldnt come out then  days later on our way home we noticed the seam was coming loose at the top of the bag next to the strap to our disgust we discovered that we missed the return window to mail this piece of crap back by three dayspoor shoddy construction  will last less than a month dont buy
4242,1,very confusingvery confusing
9488,5,i love this little rice cooker its the perfect size for me and my husband it is small compared to and instant pot of something similar so be sure to take note of the size but i love itperfect size for me

3551,2,i mean light quality and just actual functionality of this camera or poor i needed to update when i initially got it and it stayed on the finished uploading screen for so long and i tried to turn it off it still stayed frozen for awhile sometimes when i record itll freeze for awhile again just very poor functionalitywait awhile till they make improvements
532,1,this camera just wont turn onrefurbished camera not turning on
4331,2,concept is perfect for carrying your camera safely while hiking for example however the sling strap is very wide on your shoulder and is not comfortable for a woman also the straps cant get tight enough so the minute one bends down the sling backpack flips to the front  negating the whole purpose it seems to be designed for a man as pictured i didnt return it as there may be some use for it in my family the construction of the pack and interior material is solid and appears to be wellmade still looking for a similar item designed for womenconcept is perfect for carrying your camera safely while hiking
22,5,i have a samsung galaxy  with pelican case and the wife has iphone  with pelican case and they both charge easily and quickly on these chargers bought to take on trip with us but ended up using them all the time would recommend purchase for surethis one really works
7908,2,this thing serves its purpose for the price but it is a real piece of garbage you have to restart it a lot to get it to workworks  of the time
4217,2,i got this camera for my daughter  for xmas its not the best but it was decent for my daughter who wanted to record her face while playing a pc game well the charger port on the camera had issues it would stay connected to the laptop and it wouldnt stay charging and then the screen when taking a pic started to get wavy lines in it this happened  days after xmas these would be decent for young kids but i have a feeling this camera is a hit or miss so just be carefuluhhh
7785,2,a cheap make very light like a toy cameradisappointed
11097,5,"first of all this combo rice cooker and steamer is just perfect for myself or when i cook for a guest however for testing purposes i cooked a couple of meals for myself and a hungry guest the results is that it does a excellent job preparing meals for two people and in about  minutes to  minutes time depending on what you are cooking in this combo potthe steamer part is enough for two people the rice part makes enough for up to six people for the rice however i make plenty of rice for me one person and place the leftover rice in tightly zipped ziplocked bags and the leftover rice lasts me up to six days in the fridge i eat one of these packages of rice at night and pour gravy over it a sauce or even stir fry etcpros cooking rice and steaming veggies at the same timethis unit is made to steam up to  cups of cooked rice the amount of rice that i placed into the bottom cooker section was  cups of uncooked rinsed white rice which resulted in  cups of cooked rice which was plenty for the meal i prepared for myself and my guest after our meal i still had  cups of rice the next day in which to prepare yummy fried rice with veggies one of my favorite dishesto steam fluffy and tender brown whole grain rice  i added just  cup more water to the pan and added the measured brown rice i let it cook for a full  minutes because i added the extra water the rice came out fully cooked very fluffy and did not clump the taste was great so now i will be cooking more brown rice how to steam both rice and veggies at the same time to be done at the same time for two people i measured the rice into the bottom section and the water as shown on page  of this book i steamed these veggies in the top section as shown on page  these vegetables     cup of spinach  sliced roma tomato medium  small whole onion sliced in thin slices    cup of baby carrots    cup of thinly sliced celery  cup of chopped garlici had prepared a very light white sauce before this and at the end of the cooking i added the sauce to the steamed veggies and this made a wonderful vegetable and rice dish with sauce meal and it was quite filling water  i added the amount of water that the cooker called for with the rice however i added good quality bottled water in place of the tap water time to cook both the rice and the vegetable  the rice that i cooked was done in  minutes and the veggies also in  minutes i like the veggies tender so for me both were done at the same time i do not like gummy rice or overcooked rice and this rice came out fluffy making soups chilis or stews this will serve two people depending on how big the bowls are in each serving  the night before i made chili or stew i had already cooked my meat and it sat in the fridge until i was ready to make my chili or stew so i then added all of my ingredients to make one of these note it does not make much stew or chili however if i make this just for me or if making lots of chili or stew i prefer to make it in a large  quart dutch oven on my stove cooktop so there are more servings for othersupdate sept    i spilled water on the instruction manual that came with the cooker and called the aroma customer service and they are mailing me the same manual to my home to replace the one i spilled the water on at no chargealso i went to google and did a search for aroma  pdf and found the full color manual in pdfthis is the best combo rice cookersteamer that i have ever ownedperfect rice cooker and steamerbest i have ever used a detailed review follows"
7213,2,didnt work well for mejust ok
7723,1,this camera worked for no exaggeration two minutes just long enough for our daughter to get super excited about and ultimately crushed over the camera she got for her third birthdayif the screen hadnt stopped working completely i think we could have looked over the fact that it was made from the absolute cheapest lightest plastic material but alasextremely disappointed but not as much as our daughter is would give it  stars if i couldcamera worked for  minutes
4692,1,arrived broken i havent decided if im gonna give them a  chance or not i so hate returning thingsarrived broken
13231,4,the rice can get a little burnt in the bottom but we unplugged the rice cooker to prevent that from happening overall my parents like itgood rice cooker
8231,1,at first i was happy with the drift xl camera i bought white as i wanted it to stand out as i commute on my bike to work the main use was asa dash cam all worked fine for a couple of monthshowever after two months the videos that the camera were recording stopped downloading from the camera to my iphone this rendered the camera useless to me as i could not watch anything that was being recordedi contacted customer service at drift on multiple occasions in an attempt to rectify the issue they advised different bits of advice but none of it solved the issue at one point they told me that the app was under construction to then tell me two weeks later that it was actually never under constructionafter  weeks of waiting for them to help i have sent the camera back to amazon who have refunded the differencethere are a lot of negative reviews about this camera because of the faults that occur personally i would avoid buying this camera  i certainly wont be buying anymore drift products 
3513,1,camera did not have sd card slot on bottom of camera as advertised and as in the instructions camera will not take pics without card installationmisleading
3659,1,photo too small not cleartoo small of a picture
14281,4,"this is my first big kitchen applicance since i moved in my new apartment and i couldnt be more pleased ive been thinking about purchasing a rice cooker for a few months now but never followed through but then i ran across this bad boy and couldnt pass it upi ordered it and then they arrived super quick and the rice cooker looks so fancy sitting on my kitchen counter that i dont mind leaving it out and it looks so sleek fabulous that my roommate is now excited to have our new rice cooker and to use itunfortunately for me life got hectic as soon as this item arrived so i havent been able to test it out yet but i have researched several recipes and i am excited to put this rice cooker to the test plus ive read that you can make other dishes besides rice dishes as well with this so i am so looking forward to put my creativity to the testill be back soon to update my review after taking this rice cooker for a test drive so excited about my new rice cooker"
9328,4,this is a very easy to use rice cooker however it will leave the rice on the bottom scorched a little most of the time but not badly otherwise the rice is usually cooked to my liking thoughfluffy simple and easy instructions worth the pricesimple
8069,2,the picture quality is a joke this camera takes worse pictures that the polaroids in the  definitely a big waste of time and moneydont waste your money
6096,1,this item came damage from the beginning turned it on and the flashing light started right away bought new batteries new nonexpired film and it still didnt work returning it as we speakdamaged
14279,5,"i am using this cooker since about a year and i am very glad i bought it being hesitant at first to have an additional appliance where i could easily cook rice on the stove  this is making my life so much easieri set up the rice cooking option somewhen during the day knowing it will be available just perfect when we are readyanother great thing i set up the hot cereal we love the  hot cereal from bobs red mill before bed set the timer for the morning and it keeps warm until everyone gets up sometimes over the time of  hours topped with yoghurt nuts and berries we have another healthy breakfast option highly recommendedthe cleaning takes a tiny bit i got used to easily lift the lid the inner lid and clean it together with the inside bowl not a big thingso glad i bought this"
8958,1,been using this camera for about a month and it started shutting down during video recording not saving my recordings and freezing worthless paperweight i want my money backi want my money back
15476,5,great little rice cooker this is the first time ive ever used one and thought this would be difficult to use but boy this was so easy the steamer pan is metal with a nonstick ceramic like coating on the inside the lid fits really good and has a hole for releasing steam this rice cooker includes a small plastic measuring cup plastic spoon instruction manual and a small recipe booklet with a few recipes to get you started the plug detaches completely from the cooker to cook the rice all you have to do is place your ingredients in the pot press the onetouch pushbutton and let the cooking begin in about  minutes the cooker will automatically switch to warm so that your rice doesnt keep cooking i dont know how long the cooker will actually stay on warm but we had it on warm for about an hour and a half before turning it off the rice did not stick together or to the pan this cooker is smaller than what i was expecting i was only able to use  cups of rice i made restaurant style mexican rice using extra long white rice other ingredients i put in my cooker included spices  cup tomato sauce  and  cups of chicken stock  cup onion and  tablespoons each of frozen corn lima beans and peas by time i added everything it was filled to the max i was worried that the rice would expand and over flow but luckily it did not after  minutes of cooking i let it sit in the cooker for an additional  minutes before checking the rice unfortunately the rice was still aldente i had to add more chicken stock and let the rice sit on warm for a while longer it helped the rice was good and my family was happy with the results there was plenty of rice for  people plus enough for left overs for us the next day great for smaller batches of rice on my next batch of rice i will make some adjustments perhaps use a little less rice so that i can i use more chicken stock in hopes that it wont come out aldente i cant say how well it holds up to the dishwasher because i will be handwashing the parts that can be washed this will get used often recommendthe perfect little rice cooker
1362,1,im having issues with this camera since day one it constantly makes me format the sd card and when i say constantly i mean it something like  out of  uses in one occasion it asked me to format the card but the camera wasnt able to actually see the card so i had to use my pc luck me i was still home or i wouldnt be able to use the camera at all that day a special day  anniversary that same day the camera shut off due to overheating after a  minutes recording inside a car with the ac on the trip was  minutes so i lost the last  minutes the part we arrived to the restaurant in another occasion neither the camera nor the pc were able to access the recorded files forcing me to format the card again losing my files test files but a huge deal if it was a different day testing a different sd card did not solve the issues so its not a sd card issue if you search online about this camera on reddit for instance youll see several people with issues similar to the one im experiencing as of different issues it seems like this camera was not launched finished im ready to return itnot as good as it may look
861,1,sometimes it takes photos and sometimes it doesnt sometimes they print n sometimes theres an error brought on a trip and could only use it about  of the time reliablyinconsistent picture
4110,1,arlo get your act together because right now i consider you a huge ripoff yes the images are decent also the battery life is pretty good  if you use the rechargeable batteries not so good if you dont as for easy to install eh its okay but the biggest problem and the reason for the one star rating is the complete failure to actually be a security camera even though its advertised this way if you are curious what your pet is doing during the day and dont care if the system functions all the time great go ahead and spend the money if you have money burning a hole in your pocket but if its security you need keep lookingit is offline more than online it has system failure that trying to get it back on line takes not only hours but sometimes days settings for away from home are useless because it crashes and has to be rebooted from the device itself as well as take every single camera all the way back to the base station to reset them for security purposes my cameras are all mounted out of reach except with an  foot ladder with the exception of one that requires a  ladder so every time it fails at least once a month or more i have to drag out the ladders and go to each of the cameras take them down go to the base station and then fiddle with it until it decides to recognize its own cameras and then put them all back one time it never recognized a camera no matter how many times i tried it failed it would start the process and then nope nothing nada the next time the whole system failed it finally recognized this last camera after the aforementioned ladders up down base station fiascohow can this be sold as a security camera when it fails miserably i spent a lot of money buying accessories for this in addition to the initial system but it is not a security camera if it does not stay functioning i replaced both my router and modem also netgear so they should play nice together to ensure i have the most secure and recent technology not a cheap fix and still fail on the end of arlo all my other devices attached to my network have no issues but arlo is a failthis is not  not  not a security camera have fun keeping track of your pets
7899,1,i want to like this product and the idea is awesome but the picture quality is terrible the image on my phone does not match the image that is printed the printed image is grainy dark with no visible details in the printed picture you cannot even tell there is a color to them stempoor quality
4727,1,first camera sent was given as a gift and stopped working after one roll of film replacement camera worked for a while but now only works on video setting pictures cannot be taken waste of moneywould not purchase again
974,1,the picture quality sucksthis camera sucks
11203,5,like this product works greatworks great
2947,2,i was really excited about the price but was disappointed in the film quality all photos had at least a blank corner which after speaking to polaroid directly is a film issue but should be covered with a replacement by any certified sellers the other issue was completely distorted images i think caused by olddefective chemicals i finally got in touch with someone from amazon and received a replacement which was delivered in a plastic shipment bag meaning the box itself was crushed it was near impossible enough to speak to a person to be able to request a replacement the first time i wasnt going to send back used film cartridges which is all i had as the only way to tell if its working is to use them so thats the associated risk with buying them from here and not directly from the polaroid website or a store i havent had the time to figure out how to speak to a human at amazon again buy at your own riskfirst shipment of film was defective the replacement was as well and also came crushed
5571,1,camera is easy to use however it did not come with everything thats pictured there was supposed to be  of film and only  came also there was no design buttons for the shutter button like it states kind of feel like this was a rip off being that i only got this one because i wanted the extra film pksonly came with a  of film
5319,1,was so excited for my son to open this on his birthday he had been wanting one for awhile such a disappointment when the camera came and would not turn on after looking at it i found out why the camera came with the metal coil that conducts the battery power completely missingcame broken and not usable
4209,1,broke in less than  daysbought  cameras they both broke on our trip in less than  days i do not recommend these
1039,1,this item was returnedunusable camera
1434,2,bought this in hopes to use at a wedding next weekend didnt have  sd card but unit accepted a  that i hadon hand unpacking and setup was good and took several photos picture quality was poor set resolution up to  mega pixel and took another round of pictures quality still pretty bad dont think this will be usable for my intended purpose perhaps as a childs camera or something attached sample photosunpacking and setup was good and took several photos
7527,2,thought by now the knock off action cameras would be decent but this is an inferior product to even the first gopros from ages ago that i have used sound quality is terrible even out of the housing the sound quality is so low you can barely pick up any ambient sounds still image quality is like an old flip phone the lens flares at the first sign of bright light and is it is not even really  capable has some sort of digital interpolation up scaling  the image stabilization does not work well either  the videos looked better with it turned off the only thing it did ok at was video at the   the  and  settings when not in really bright light just an awful camera even at the price point the touch screen menus were also very glitchy and some of the settings would not let me access them at times those who gave it good reviews must have never used a quality action camera or there must be wide variances in quality control sent mine back and picked up an older gopro hero  blackbetter to just to spend the money on a go pro even an older one
6652,1,for the first week of using this camera it was great i was so impressed the following week however i realized that this camera is complete trash the hinges are so cheap that its already starting to fall apart it claims that its  yet the quality of pictures is of a throwaway camera the price and accessories may be tempting but avoid this camera at all costs learn from my mistake and unfortunate financial investmentcomplete trash of a camera
4271,1,superficially nice will come apart at the seams eventually theres no repairing it given how cheap the construction is ive bought two and i wish id invested in something more durablewont last long if it gets real use
178,2,horrible camera dont buyshabby camera it was returned
1139,1,what a piece of crap this is you have to format the memory card every time you turn the camera on it holds one photo and then says card full seriously dont waste your moneydont buy
4336,1,very disappointed in this altura photo camera sling the padding seemed slim to say the least but the deal breaker for me were zippers on the bag which were always snagging on the bag material not one of its zippers opened or closed without difficulty they all got hungup on the surrounding material the zipper issues were so substantial i returned the bag after a few days and ordered a more expensive lowepro sling pack instead the lowepro sling had zippers which worked flawlessly and the amount of padding in the lowepro sling was much more substantial and could easily prevent damage to the camera in an unintended drop ive purchased altura products before but never their camera bags i know now not to even consider them as this one was substandardproblematic zippers all around
4496,1,came faulty doesnt even load filmwaste of time 
2646,2,this camera is so small i thought it was for a doll and i had maybe ordered the wrong item no i ordered correctly but in my own fault did not check the dimensions this isnt worth almost  dollarstiny
2123,1,first cartridge stuck in camerajunk camera
1049,1,received camera and no memory card or directions of where one goes or what i am supposed to buy to insert do not buyno memory card cant use camera
7579,2,the light quality is pretty good but they are a little fussy to adjust and aim and they tend not to stay put the whole assembly is very lightweight and tips over readily ive owned them  years and now the wiring is coming out of the little control dongle one of the lights has stopped working rather disappointing as i have not abused them but perhaps the constant tipovers tugged on the wiresnot durable disappointing
6523,1,i had just want to use it today and charged it because it wouldnt turn on purchased it on december just tried it and set it aside for when im ready to use it unfortunately after charging it does not turn on anymoreonly worked once  never turned on after charging for the first time
7475,2,so i decided to get this camera after reading all the reviews about it well the video quality is not that good and the sound recorder is just awful i know its a budget camera but i would not recommend it better to save some bucks and get a better onenot worth it
146,1,tried multiple packs of film all came out blurry must be the camerablurry
9110,1,the film came opened and once exposed to light the film is not good anymore i tried to put it in the camera but it wont even roll out properlydont bother buying used
8180,1,had this camera for  rides i charged it overnight and when i went to grab it for my ride it wouldnt turn on notice a big lump coming out of the side of the camera my guess is something happened with the battery was able to return it with no issues via amazon going to need convincing to purchase this brand of camera againbattery fried after  rides
3724,1,got it charged 
13980,2,unfortunately this rice cooker didnt do a great job for me i usually cook either jasmine rice or basmati rice and while the jasmine rice cooked alright not as good as my previous zojirushi which didnt have the induction feature the basmati rice came out borderline inedible you might be able to get better results by ignoring the recommended water amounts and finding what works best for basmati  long grain rice but i dont always cook the same amount of rice and so i need a consistent way to measure the water and get good results a long grain setting is sorely needed here lastly the time display on this unit is in military time and it is not possible to change this all in all i am returning this one as i dont feel that it meets the advertised abilities 
11077,5,great addition to my kitchen does not burn rice and super easy to use clean and store highly recommendgreat
6506,2,i used for less an hour for a videoand the battery was lowin less an hourthe battery is not good
4803,2,the camera was actually fun to use and easy the first time hung it up until i got more film  after refilling it did not take any more picturesdid not work after refill
6717,2,it feels more like a  backpack thin feels cheap im actually kind of mad i spent  on it theres much better quality in this price rangeaverage overpriced
1821,1,it only works long enough for the return window to close this is my second camera the first time i returned it due to randomly not working after working just fine thankfully i caught it in time before the return window was up unfortunately with this second go round i didnt get so lucky i had the same problem no matter how hard i push the button turn it on and off or how new the film and batteries were it just wont work i loved it first gave a very much fun  feel to moments that mean the most to me but now its just a waste of money get at your own risk if you wantbarely works
8948,1,wouldnt ever keep a charge and work so i returned it im disappointed because it seemed like such a nice camera and it was purple that color is good so if you were to go to a wedding or party everyone sets their camera down and theyre all black is ready tho find yourspurple great color but camera didnt work
5527,1,two things about this camera number  way to complex for a point and shoot when using this camera at full extension the only way to get it to contract  back to home positionis too turn it offnot what i thought 
4819,1,it stopped working for no reason after  monthsbroke within  months
1981,1,i think after some thought ive decided that im a bit disappointed with this product i highly enjoyed my previous camera a  for a solid year it was a great camera and a ton of fun to use its battery died in the summer of this past year and i finally got around to being able to afford this polaroidnow camera to replace it i was under the impression that having a newer model would end up with it being nicer which in some ways it is and in some ways it isnt the autofocus is nice and i really like the inclusion of a lit flash button those are two features that i think are fantastic and its a good positive the picture quality is what youd expect the film has a cozy and warm look to it now for the bad and there is quite a bit to say here this is not a bad camera by any stretch unless your comparing it to the  or onestep the plastic that now is made out of is cheaper to the touch and lighter it feels less hefty in the hands which on one hand is good but it also makes you feel like youre handling more of a toy the power button has to be held down to turn on or off which is an overall downgrade from the nice tactile feel of the simple onoff switch of the  another downgrade is the filmbay mechanism ive noticed that it is way weaker the button feels all gummy and is hard to depress and the bay doesnt even spring open without added force which is a mild annoyance compared to the easy to find and press springloaded switch of the older one which is in a perfect spot in the front the strapholders are also harder to tie camera straps on to as theyre inset into the body rather than the easy to work with extrusions of the  and now for a big one there is no mount underneath for usage with a tripod which again is a big big negative that i wasnt aware of please keep this in mind if youre going to get one of these if you have your choice id recommend the onestep over these vastly inferior later models im honestly considering returning this and getting my money back so i can get one myselfedit ive also noticed that my order did not even include a camerastrap which was the nail in the coffin for me im going to return this asaponestep forward onestep back
5011,1,the product was clearly used and had missing items and wouldnt turn on i will order another one and will update if its good or badnot working and had missing items and also was used
4459,2,i was looking for something that would easily sync to my google cloud photos and this doesnt have that feature also only allows  photos to be displayed at a timenot as compatible
1704,1,hate it maybe we arent tech savvy enough i dont know purchased this for my  year old granddaughter to make videos she cant figure out how to edit them or do anything with them so its really not filling the bill for us ive contacted seller  times with questions but no responsehate it
13103,5,its a very good rice cooker with one flaw the rice vent is in the back and water leaks down the back of the rice cooker where the plug for the rice cooker entersit works
6321,1,cant even make up the picture it takespoor quality camera 
3734,1,the pictur camara worked good but the selphy  got damaged with only one time useselphy  not good at all
9277,5,love this thing so much better than hoping my rice turns out okay on the stove perfect for just my husband and iwonderful little rice maker
1710,1,had to return quality not to good and its been  weeks already still havent gotten money backreview
3982,1,product works only for inside house use outside use in sunlight the photos dont show for the price its not worth it for kids use onlyfor kid use only
7386,1,grandchild didnt like it i cant find out how to returnwant to return
6650,1,i was so excited to receive this camera up until i tested it and it was extremely laggy not to mention the quality was not good no matter how much i messed with the setting it was not gooddont waste money one this
2811,1,we bought these cameras for our daughters thinking theyd be a good entrylevel camera however the photos were meh out of the box and really crap in lowlight conditions even for a kids camera both suffered abysmal battery life  they would get  photos not video from a full charge before the camera gave a battery low message and shut off they were fairly quick to charge from my portable battery pack so the kids would get a flurry of pictures before back in my bag to recharge they both froze up and glitched constantly as well requiring the battery to be pulled each time which also reset the datetime so all of the photos were timestamped to  ie  years ago rather than retaining the current time and date so i either have to edit the times to add them to google photos or just leave them out of our online photo albums super disappointing not worth  each not really worth  each we returned them in the thankfullylong postchristmas return windowbought two both were garbage and returned
7188,2,i wish i would have paid more attention to the photos if you look at them closely you can see that nobody has the strap snugly on their hands this is because the strap does not tighten enough to be snug i have large hands and this strap doesnt come close to actually fitting i am not sure why there are so many  star reviews do people really want a hand strap which doesnt strap in the hand maybe i am missing something i sent mine back and got a nice leather strap which fits like a glove literallypay attention to the photos does not fit
10475,5,first time use turned out perfectly use the little cup included to measure your rice  the fill line in the pot for the water do not use your normal measuring cup it automatically turns from cook to warm when donelove this little rice cooker
8887,2,camera developed a problem a few months after i purchased it and the manufacturer declined to fix itpoor manufacturer support
8715,1,please help i am about to return this item because of the following problem when i want to watch the recording i get this notice and there is no recordingnothing   the document  could not be opened the file isnt compatible with quicktime player i dont want to download softwared etc either to fix the problem hopefully i get help and dont have to return it thankshelp i am getting this notice the file isnt compatible with quicktime player
5015,1,so disappointed i ordered a camera for my wedding last week the first camera did not work tried to exchange for another one but the shipping was delayed now tried to reorder one and it came in a beat up box that looked like it had been opened already photos of someones random child and missing product so disappointed requested an exchange for one final try will update if rectifiedsold me a used and returned kit for the  time

6699,1,would not charge i gave this to my grandson for his birthday and he was very excited to use it it wouldnt charge and had to be returned very disappointedreturned
14792,1,my error i did not believe those who wrote it was difficult to use i found the manual online here on amazon but it is nearly incomprehensible for even the most basic how much water for how much rice for example pressing menu brings a screen its light grey on red hard to read with what looks like a skull and flashing and to the right its stuck on glutinous i hate to throw away something that is unused but it is useless for me i bought it for the proclaimed versatility but id give it no stars except that it is attractivelookingso difficult to know how to use this rice cooker
7757,1,bought in june for my daughters birthday in october gave it to her and it doesnt work the screen has lines on it instead of a clear picture would return but amazon wont allow a return after july when bought in june garbagegarbage doesnt work
1814,1,it stopped working after  cartridges it wouldnt turn on even with new batteries the flash indicator light will blink but it will not take any picturesi missed my return window by  days please do yourselves a favor and do not buy this complete waste of my money my daughter loved it and wants a new oneso jokes on mewill not repurchase itexpensive piece of garbage
6986,1,i have been a fujifilm fan for years i had the mini for several years and it worked great i bought this model in march for a trip to india i teach photography classes and use the camera to give photos to people i photograph that was my plan but the camera flashed error on the first day i made three frames and then it stopped working i thought it was a fluke i returned it and bought another i used it for two months and then error two cameras and several packs of film down it has been extremely frustrating and i would not recommend buying this camerai had the mini for several years and it worked great i bought this model in march for a 
17318,5,"i needed to buy a replacement rice cooker to the one my mom bought for me when i was a college student many many moons ago after doing a lot of research online a few months ago i decided to buy the zojirushi  instead of the model with pressure i already had a pressure cooker and the zojirushi website indicated that with the pressure model you are discouraged from cooking oatmeal because doing so may clog up the pressure release mechanisms i dont eat a lot of oatmeal but i wanted the option of cooking it in the zojirushifor the quality of the rice cooked this cooker is pretty fantastic the texture and moisture of the rice seem far better than the rice from the traditional noninduction heating cookers with this cooker the bottom of the bowl does not end up with the usual browned rice layer which was never a favorite of mine with all traditional popup rice cookers i had used in the past the brown rice setting on the zojirushi works like a charm my ancient  popup rice cooker struggled to make brown rice correctly  usually the brown rice was undercooked or unevenly cooked however the zoshirushi produced moist fluffy brown rice i have read many complaints or gripes on the amazon website about the quality of the rice produced and i honestly wonder whether those reviewers properly rinsed the rice grains before starting the cook cycle it makes all the difference also even though zojirushi has the water levels for a variety of rice marked on the bowl there can be variations depending on not only the variety of rice you have how dry the uncooked rice grains are the moisture in the storage container of the uncooked rice  etc so if the rice turns out too mushy to your tastes use less water the next time and if the rice turns out too crunchy to your tastes use a little more water the next time i suppose some people expect perfect rice every time and for all types of rice within the types marked inside the rice bowl as far as the rewarming and extended warming features on the unit the unit does not seem to allow you to manually turn on those features if you had depressed the cancel button after a cooking cycle has completed also the cord on this unit unfortunately is neither retractable nor detachable my old cheapo cooker did not have one too but the cord was detachable i suspect that the induction heating elements reduce the available interior space of the cooker for a cordwinding mechanism but it would have been nice for this unit to at least have a detachable cordthe question for many is whether the zoshirushi induction heating model is worth the price the answer is it depends if you are a discerning rice eater and are very patient to wait for the rice or organized enough to plan hours in advance this cooker will produce beautiful results and you will not be disappointed with that said i give this cooker  because for my chaotic lifestyle i rarely have  hours to wait for the rice to cook luckily the quick setting which is still  minutes or so longer than most traditional popup rice cookers i have used on the unit cooks jasmine rice pretty well but admittedly not nearly as well as the very long jasmine setting and the taste of the pretty well is only a little bit better than my ancient traditional popup rice cooker which costs even at todays prices a whole lot less i have no regrets on my purchase of this zojirushi model whatsoever because i am a bit of a foodie but buyers need to carefully think about their needs and expectations before paying this much for this particular rice cooker or any other highend rice cooker for those who need help figuring out these needs and expectations check out   that website offers good insights and advice on rice cookers happy eatingupdated commentsafter more months of use i am a bigger fan of this rice cooker to eat healthier i have been eating only brown rice using the gaba setting wow did that make a difference in taste and texture because of my chaotic schedule i was using the quick setting for brown rice instead of the  hour brown rice setting or  hour gaba setting the gaba setting is a game changer for me the gaba brown rice is nuttier and the texture is soft without being mushy the aroma is amazing i am definitely a fan of the gaba brown rice setting and this rice cooker overall the keep warm setting does not dry out the rice too much if the rice becomes a little dry i sprinkle about a shot of water and lightly fold the rice to distribute the water in a few minutes the rice texture is significantly restored two other tips would be to i rinse the brown rice over and over until the water runs clear ii meticulously measure the water level on a flat surface outside of the cooker itself and iv fluff up the rice immediately after the finishedcooking chimes go off after  minutes the rice texture overall becomes fluffy and less gummy if you wait too long after the chimes go off to fluff the texture is still good but not nearly as good as it can be these tips actually make a significant differenceadmittedly i used to think that a  hour gaba setting cook time was not practical for my schedule however i cannot argue with the excellent results i put the rice cooker on delayed timer before i leave home for work and when i come home i am greeted by the sweet nutty aroma of my brown gaba rice i changed my overall rating to five starsthis cooker is pretty fantastic the texture and moisture of the rice "
5022,1,my daughter used it  times and it stopped working i wish i could talk to someone not good
9682,5,this rice cooker is easy too use and cook rice perfectly every timeperfect rice every time
8858,2,i was looking for a newer point and shoot with zoom to replace my old old nikon this camera is not it the shutter is way to slow even on action settings the zoom was not impressive with significant grain so i returned it and opted for a nikon  for  more totally worth itnot for me
3297,1,this camera was bought for a birthday gift for my granddaughter and the birthday was  the return date was  because i bought it  the camera buttons stopped working after  days of use and the screen went completely blurry the next day of course this all happened after the return date because the return date was one day after the birthday the bad part is i bought a  one exactly like the first one for her brothers birthday on  im sure that one wont be any better i would like to return them both since i am only one week past the return date and his first one wasnt even opened until  but i dont know what to do at this pointbroke in less that a week
1058,1,i thought for the price that it would be a somewhat decent camera it was more like a play camera for a child we couldnt even get the pictures to download off the cameravery cheap camera not worth the money
6617,1,i bought a second nikon coolpix after banging the first moderately and finding out it cost the price of a new one to get it repaired the second one stopped working after being dropped less than one foot onto beach sand need to be a little more sturdyway too fragile
7809,1,this photo album is cheap plastic material feels like a cheap  folder youd get from the dollar store  is a little too much to spend on something like this the album is not well put together with pointysharp edges which can scratch you if youre not careful it scratched me as i opened it out of the plastic the elastic band feels more sturdy than the binder itself for something for display i think it could be useful but if youre looking for something sturdy safe for the pictures that wouldnt get bent easily or squashed this isnt the album for youcheap material
3382,1,quality of pictures is awful my old nokia  makes better picsquality of pictures is awful
7185,1,just pitched this piece of trash it got looser and looser at the buckle that loops through the metal screw on piece the more i used it had it about  weeks before it finally failed and luckily i was indoors and the camera hit carpet if i were outdoors and damaged my camera i would have gone after the company that made this pile of garbage im happy other folks seem to have better luck with it than i did but i just wanted to write this to warn them to keep an eye on the garbage chinese plastic buckle that holds the strap to the metal screw on mountfell apart and camera dropped
1225,1,daughter just called from camp she plugged her camera in before going down to eat lunch and came back to it in the same spot but when she went to use it the screen is shattered from the inside and nothing works there is a grey screen with rainbow lines when its on but no cracksbroke within a couple days
8071,1,camera routinely ate film you push the button the acts like the photo was taken and then nothing comes out also the lighting sucks and either looks washed out or even big white spots same issues with the camera as  years agoreturning camera has same issues has the  versions
3879,2,just got the camera havent really used it but want to let everyone know the ibis mechanism gives a humming noise thats quite loud can be heard at arms length and does not disappear even if you turn off ibis at least one other reviewer confirmed it and also commented it gets picked up by any video shot without external mic as wellto me the noise is quite annoying for even normal operation very disappointed as i thought this was the near perfect midlevel camera ive been waiting for also very disappointed at dpreview for not disclosing the issue and significantly played down the jerky video issue in their review as well panasonic announced on instagram they will release firmware update to fix the jerky issue not sure whether that can eliminate the noise or not seriously considering returning it and rebuy later if issues get fixedtwo stars for now given the camera does look and feel very well designed and built and the stellar reviews around the web on other aspectsdisappointed and annoyed by loud humming noise from ibis
14784,5,very easy to use keeps rice hot and ready to eat on demand for hours without overcookinga fantastic rice cooker
6496,1,i bought it and it wont turn on so basically they shipped me a product that doesnt work i didnt even get to enjoy it i have a maternity video to record next weekendfailure
8147,2,very disappointed with this camera right out of the box you cant just do bluetooth like with my back camera  ce you have to actually go though a big comparitivly process to connect to their wifi network that it broadcast  this is technology show off for the sake of it on a solution that worked great with simple and quick bluetoothnext lack of image stabilization makes even at the highest resolution reading license plates impossiblelast i run it in dash cam mode on the fly you simply have a overwrite mode as well as a dash cam mode so when i get home from my ride and plug it in for charging they decided that it should when it dash mode automatically start recording  god that is stupid interface design their answer to me was simply turn off dash cam mode every time i need to charge it after every ride and then turn it back on before every ridei have to keep it because the form factor verses stupid looking and boxy hero cams is awesome and the battery life is great as well as the rotating lens the freaking heros battery life is so bad i would have to carry spare batteries with me on a  hour ridei want to turn on the cameras forget about them till i get home and plug them in and repeat i dont want to have to mess with them all the time  it gets  stars for the form factor and battery life and rotating lens which as i stated are awesome otherwise it would get nada for stupid programming and interface designbattery life and form factor horrible picture at   plain stupid software interface design
7174,2,it wasnt a bad product it just work for me i had to put it on and take it off just to do simple task with my hand it could work for some other people but it just wasnt working for medidnt work for me
7729,2,the picture quality is super overexposed its not super user friendly for a kid to use i just now gave it for a birthday surprise and it is too late to return or i would in a second  expensive for what it is and low qualityskip it
3945,1,camera never worked tried  sets of new batteries camera turned on but flash never did couldnt use photo button either to take a picture i tried the trouble shooting instructions and watched the video no help unfortunately disappointed since it was a birthday present and she was going to use it at her partynever worked
5565,1,there were plenty of reviews saying the film didnt turn out and i chose to purchase anyways but its true dont waste your time like i did two out of the  pictures came out so i know it is not a user errordont buy this
6998,1,this camera was broken brand new out of the box wasted  in film trying to figure out what was wrong only to discover that the camera is just plain broke right out of the box read the reviews of all the problems this camera has i have not idea how in  these kind of problems exist in a technology that was invented in the  not work out of the box
11929,4,"im extremely happy with this rice cooker and i was very surprised by the difference in quality of the rice it handily beats both cooking it on the stove top and cooking it in my instant pot it is not without fault but i can live with the minor flaws given how good the resulting rice isfor reference i made rice using standard tap water and tamanishiki premium short grain white rice i rinsed and drained the rice six times before cooking and i am cooking at high altitude  feetprosrice made in this cooker comes out perfectly cooked every time it is fluffy and sticky comes out of the cooker easily and is great for eating with chopsticks it is just like high quality rice served at restaurants when using quality short grain rice it produces rice that is exactly like what ive had in japanthe nonstick inner pot is easy to remove and clean unlike cooking in the stovetop or in my instant pot i dont need to soak the cooking vessel before cleaning as theres no rice and very little film left after cookingthe cooker comes with an internal reel that winds up the power cord for easy storage i missed this in the product description so it was a very nice surprisethe inner pot is marked with water levels for various amounts of uncooked rice this is surprisingly handythe clock is battery powered so it doesnt lose the time when unplugged this is a really nice little touchoperation of the device is dead simplethe cooker can hold prepared rice for later use for a surprisingly long time ive tested it as far as  hours after preparation and it was just as good as it was freshly made complete with a little plume of steam when openedconsthe cooker cannot hold the included scoop paddle and steamer basket inside itself all at the same time for storageit can however hold the scoop and the paddle if you store the steamer basket separately this is a big benefit to the instant pot which can hold its power cord trivets ladle and rice paddle inside itself when stored note that i have the  model the larger version may be able to do thisthe manual says that the cooker can make batches as small as  cups rice but the internal pot is only marked for water levels for as low as  cup uncooked rice if you want to make a small batch you must do the water measurement yourself the amounts are given in a provided manual insert this could have been avoided with extra lines inside the pot which would have been so easy to addwhen this cooker refers to a cup of rice it means the included scoop not a standard us cup this refers to a japanese standard for a serving of uncooked rice about  us standard cup this isnt that much of a drawback but it is important to keep in mind dont lose that scoopthe cooking cycle takes about an hour four times longer than standard rice cooking this is because the cooking cycle incorporates soaking and steaming time though so it is worth itthe manual says that it is designed for medium and shortgrain rice but does include substitute water measurements for longgrain keep in mind that if you want to cook longgrain you cant use the marks inside the cooking vessel to measure the waterconclusionif youre considering this device and reading reviews then youre probably like me in that youre wondering if the results are really worth the hype i think they absolutely are now that i have this cooker theres no reason at all for me to cook rice any other way the results simply arent in the same league as stovetop or instant pot rice cooking only you can decide if thats worth the price of admission but i can recommend the device wholeheartedly my only points of dissatisfaction with this device are minor quibbles and nitpicks it does its job supremely well and im completely satisfied with my purchaseupdates  ive revisited this review to correct an error i made about accessory storage in the original version i incorrectly stated that the scoop and paddle couldnt be stored inside the cooker even with the steamer basket removed that was incorrect in fact the scoop and paddle can be stored inside with the basket removed but all three cannot be stored inside at the same time since writing this review this cooker has become one of my favorite appliances the cons i listed in my review all feel like extremely minor quibbles now i wanted to change my score to five stars since i love this thing so dang much but i think it is still appropriate to keep it at four for the drawbacks minor as they are this cooker is on my short list of appliances that i would replace immediately should they failrestaurant quality rice with nearzero effort"
2863,2,im not one to leave reviews unless its warranted and thats good or bad purchased this camera to shoot comedy shows and i tried it in several shooting conditions resulting in fair to average results word to the wise if youre needing a good camera dont skimp out on the quality of function for price the zoom and do uso a horrible the external mic is at best just for looks and the unit itself feels cheap when you hold itdid not live up to the positive reviews
722,1,this camera sucks at  p it will only record  min of content and for a dumb reason that  min of content will be split into several videos i dont know why its doing this the camera was purchased for long form video content but it will not work for thatalso the date and time is off because i never set it on the cameranot worth buying buy a ras pi  camera attachment and use that for long recordings
4824,2,light doesnt switch to different modes only stays on the little house  really disappointedokay
6572,2,after waiting  weeks after i ordered this camera it finally arrived its a great camera easy to use and takes wonderful pictures i would give it  stars except after owning it for just over  years it will no longer turn on of course the warranty is no longer in effect after researching on line i did all the troubleshooting steps and it still will not turn on this seemed to be a very common problem i contacted nikon and they directed me to their outsourced repair service  was the estimated repair cost plus shipping handling and insurance out and back i will not be sending it for repair because the cost is well over half the price i paid this may not be nikons topoftheline product but i expect a camera of this cost to last longer than  years there will not be anymore nikon products in my future terrible customer service and a company that does not stand behind their productdont waste your money
5451,2,this camera has great audio it has been a pretty reliable secondary unit for recording audible clips from live events and music performances for our podcast without excessive noise my complaint is that unless youre outside in open sunlight the video takes on a much darker orange tint that must be corrected in postproduction which is time consuming and degrades the video quality ive tried every exposure option on the camera and none of them adequately relieve the issue when filming inside we use three ring lights plus a handful of directional lamps our main cameras video is often too bright from trying to compensate for this cameras lack of light unfortunately this cameras video indoors at least pales dramatically in comparison to others we have used numerous times we have had to substitute backup iphone video in its place because it was just better qualityorange tinted video compared to other cameras
8586,1,was excited to receive an affordable  webcam  entered my zoom call and the resolution is very grainy ring light on it made quality worse as if it confused the lenses save your money or spend the extra money to get a webcam from a well known companyfalse advertisement not  quality save your money
6892,1,i originally ordered one of these hidden camera photo frames with a brand name of champlong according to the description it didnt record audio please note in accordance with federal law we do not sell any cameras with sound recording capabilities it did record audio so i returned it and ordered two other frames that were different brand names and sellers  hskah and jlrkeng  both which stated they did not record audio they are the exact same product all three are the same frame paperwork  box and all have the same photo in the frameunder what you need to know before you buy  note according to federal law it is forbidden to sell any camera with audio in questions question does is record sound as well answer sorry it cant by nsmamg seller on november   have been returned to amazon and i reported the incorrect product informationbuyer beware
1691,1,dislike sound qualitythe sound for this camera is not very loud i recored several videos and are unable to hear them very well even with the volume on  the sound is only at a  volume wise i basically have to scream just for the sound to come through additionally the camera quality is okay the photos are decent but not the best the usb cord is the only way to hear videos properly but thats only by connecting them to an external source laptoppc i have also ordered additional usb cords with hopes of improving the sound but they are not compatible to my pc therefore i am now stuck with a camera that i can barely hear videos would not recommend the best part of the camera is the color options i purchased a pink onesound for videos
1381,1,not recommended until such time as  provides a video showing us how to take apart the camera body most of the instructions seem to refer to another model i was unable to find a video showing me how to do it the components would not slide apart as suggestedim sure the complicated video and camera technology is impressive things like memory card installs should not be a science project i will report back as i make a few more attempts 
5810,1,my company bought this camera a few months ago to use for one of our upcoming conferences i havent had much time to use it right after it was bought it which is why this is a late review this product got great reviews and its also a canon so i felt pretty confident in its abilities however after taking some time to play around with it i realized that this camera is crap it does not do well with indoor videos or photos the quality of the images are terrible extremely grainy and not clear at all this might be okay if you only want to use it outdoors but this is not any anytime kind of camera i have seen better quality with disposable cameras if i hadnt realized this so late i would have returned it immediatelyterrible quality
3917,1,camera stop working within a few uses it was just outside of the return window so i had to do it under warranty i thought no problem i git the extra asurian warranty wrong they wouldnt help ms until the manufacture warranty was over i had to pay  to ship it to fugji only to have it returned  weeks later with the extact same issue do not waste your time or money i have a very sad little girl and no cameracamera is junk
2618,1,a gift for my granddaughterthe photo quality is very poor my polaroid from  years ago had much better picture quality
5290,1,shutter dont work goodslow in taking pic
6230,2,bought this for a trip to iceland to use in the rainaround waterfalls it was hard to use and way too big for my dslr i have a nikon  so not the biggest dslr out there but a pretty averagesized dslr so i had to roll back the front piece where the lens goes a lot and it kept slipping around and was very difficult to take pictures with after struggling with it for awhile i eventually just used a large ziploc bag wish i could return itjust use a ziploc bag
9115,1,all of the photos kept turning out so bad and very pink unfortunately cant request a refund without returning the item  which has obviously been used so thats not an optionpink photos
3,5,they work as they say they will good priceworks well
7885,2,super terrible photo quality im so disappointed ive been very excited for this to arrive i went through the  practice blanks and they all had lines so i tried a fresh package and the photo was even worse i paid too much money for this to work so poorly ill be sending backsuper terrible photo quality

6927,1,the camera takes nice wide photos and the quality is nice but these cameras will break very easily mine broke in storage one day the e error popped up after switching the batteries nothing changed i tried troubleshooting the issue apparently many have come across the same thing with  support from fujifilm i would have expected something like this from a cheaper camera but this camera is now  no one can fix this camera and now i have film for a camera that does not workid look into getting a different cameravery fragile and impossible to fix

4301,2,very small not at all what an adult wants in a sling bag maybe best for a middle schooler straps too small to make it useful as a sling and too small to be a backpack i have very few pieces of equipment and could not fit everything in the bag i would never try to add a tripod to it i dont think it could handle that in short not too useful for an adult of medium sizestraps are too short to be useful as a sling
5950,1,just got in in the mail it turned on for just a few mins and turned off and been charging it for  hours wont turn on at all  i noticed before it shut off there were pictures on it already so it was used and not new i paid for new  not a used or refurbished item do not buycame broken
4907,2,if you are beginner in photography dont buy but you can buy for kids  because it has strong corpus materialor if you have patients to play couple weeks with this camera then you can get some resultsbottom line  very strange productfor kids or for professionals
2424,2,wasnt what i expected where the lens is located it wasnt secured all the way on both sides one side was loose and coming off also not sure if it was the design of the camera  it looked like paint splatter all over iti am sending this item back and getting a refundeh
11076,4,it browned the bottom of my rice but it was my  use i will figure out the correct ratio of rice and water to keep this from happening it cooked very quickly i m happy with this great for  personcooks quickly
2286,1,started using about a week ago camera turns off by itself and wont turn back on for awhile have tried changing the batteries but that doesnt seem to resolve this issuepoor qualitykeeps turning off on its own
8155,1,just got this camera today in time to use this weekend  not no memory card is included drift do you not think this is something you should make clear to the buyer i now have to order and wait for a card to arrive before i can even test this camera out i also wonder if the camera i got is used there is no film over the lens and there is absolutely no charge on the battery so far very disappointedupdate got the card had to update the software trying to see the settings takes a magnifying glass finally got it to record and every way i turned the camera i could not get it to take a video lined up straight this camera is awful and is going back i had an old drift from years ago where you could see what you were recording on the top of the camera not this one had my old one for years and it worked great too bad they messed it upno memory card
184,2,buy it just not on amazon i was about to buy it at best buy but they had to order it and it would take too long so i went with the familiar option amazon it got here quickly but the battery charger didnt work leave the expensive tech to tech stores and everything else to amazon very good camera for beginners thoughbroken batter charger
7868,1,i can hardly even explain my disappointment youd think with how expensive this stupid paper is that it would yield fruitful results it does notmy biggest complaint is the colors  everything comes out completely different from the print preview brown and dull or tinted pink blues are wrong some reds dont show up it makes pretty pictures ugly so then i thought okay maybe the editing in the app or filters will help correct that nopesee attached images i did no inapp edits on these except to try to brighten the collage one slightly and this is how different the colors printedi also had issues with the darned paper telling me i need to use zink paper when im already using it save the blue cards that come with your paper in case you have an error it rejected one of my zink refill blue cards so i used the one from the original box again to make my refill workthe only thing i like about this is the papers builtin stickers i thought the size would be convenient and awesome but it is overshadowed by how hideous these photos come outif you only want to print in black and white or sepiaish vintagelooking photos you may enjoy or even love this product if you like bright colors image clarity accuracy your family members not looking like ogres or gremlins stay far awayi think im actually going to return this im so irritated  star reviews and these were the results so aggravating heed my warning do not buy this piece of crap unless youre a vscocam teeniebopper or a colorblind elederly woman with cataractshorrendous color  photo qualityrun far away
897,2,my camera arrived with no remote anywhere in the package also mine is somehow not compatible with any of my sd cards and i have not been able to get one successful shot yetits a camera
8038,1,i want to be super clear  this review is about amazon not the product itself i bought the mini link  from another retailer and absolutely love it its such a cool idea and weve printed so many pictures on it already if youre hesitating about the product dont if youre wondering where to buy it  dont buy from amazonthe printer i received from amazon did not work it printed one picture then gave a film ejection error i tried troubleshooting  which was difficult at first as my printer didnt come with a user manual this shouldve been my first clue but kids nowadays seem to have this tech stuff as second nature so just figured the company was saving trees or something but every time i reset the printer or turned it on and off it would spit out an unused exposure wasted  cartridges of exposures trying to troubleshoot so i got frustrated and bought one elsewhere when i opened the box to the legit brand new one i realized it was packaged much better and with more included than the one i had received from amazon at this point i obviously put all of the clues together that the one from amazon had been returned previously as it obviously doesnt workid love to say that this was probably a oneoff but this has also happened to my dad with another product from amazon so maybe we just have bad luck but its pretty bad that im paying full price for something thats already been returned because it clearly didnt work 
8316,1,very poor battery life drives my kid nuts it wont last a minute without chargingpoor battery life
4860,1,the box came with the camera case two photo albums and only two boxes of film not the  boxes  photos that were advertised funtech is running a scam with this onedid not receive  boxes of film only two boxes
9469,5,our last rice cooker was the same as this one except this model has a nonstick pot we wore our last one out using it was perfect for a family of  never had a problem until it died we will be getting another one when we ware this one out if they are still availablethis is a replacement for the one we had
5458,2,bought it last year after  months of using it couple times the screen went blank panasonic lumix  screen went blank
1391,2,quality seems to only be good when you use it inside it takes forever to focus in the sound is terrible so you would always have to do voice overs but when it does focus its pretty good qualitynot worth it
8303,1,the camera is very cute my daughter was excited to have it it worked for  minutes and never worked again the company has not responded to my requests to exchange or refunddidnt work
10466,5,"love this little thing its perfect for two peoplerecipe i put  of one onion chopped red onions finely chopped garlic  fat cloves a teaspoon of thai red curry paste more if youre an extra spicy person one chicken bullion cube or half not chickn bullion if youre vegan with one cup of water and  cup enriched jasmine rice no need to rinse enriched rice mix together well to disperse paste and bullion set to cook and when it automagically pops into warm mode the rice is perfect i used my own measuring cup instead of the one that came with the dash had to add cilantro black beans whole can rinsed and half a squeezed lime juice into a separate pot because dash is a bit too small heat for a couple of minutes salt to taste perfect and easy cilantro lime jasmine beans and rice youre welcomeperfect jasmine rice for two"
5853,2,after six months the turn onoff switch started to failtwo stars
17321,5,i upgraded to this product after many years of using a very cheap rice cooker which did a nice job for a long time i wasnt expecting that much of a boost in the quality of my rice but to my surprise theres a significant improvement in the texture color and flavor of my rice im also happy with how many options there are for cooking or setting timersvery good at what it does
8288,2,camera was fine at first then i noticed the battery doesnt stay charged long and will die after a few hours i bought it  months agobattery doesnt last long between charges
7599,2,i bought these to use in my dance space to add some colorful lighting and they dont quite hit the mark theyre bright when not using a color filter but the minute i put one it it basically adds zero brightness overall kind of wish i didnt keep them as long as i did because i would send them back oh wellworks fine but not bright
3992,1,play video it worked okay for about  months and then the settings knob for the different lighting stopped working and now it only takes black photos obviously cant return it so now  down the drainhorrible pictures
4832,2,the camera itself is perfect however i only received  pieces of film instead of the  that was promised which was very disappointing and misleadingripped off
1476,1,this is the poorest camera ive ever seen the lens must have been put in crooked because one  of each picture was more less in focus but the other  was not not much else mattersnope
6571,2,i bought this camera as a christmas gift for my wife it did not come out the box ready to use first we found that the nikon snapbridge app on iphone was not compatible with the camera so the camera wouldnt connect to the smartphone when we called customer service they knew about the problem and said the app had to be updated when we asked when it would be updated they said they dont know it could be days weeks or months completely unacceptable additionally the camera does not come with much memory we snapped  pictures and it was out of memory we were told by customer service we have to purchase more memory to save more pictures so the wireless feature doesnt work because nikon doesnt know when they are going to update the app and you have to purchase memory to snap more than  pictures its a good looking camera to the eye but it does not come out of the box ready to use it wasnt cheap either we are disappointed and wont be recommending this camera to anyonedont buy this camera
929,1,bought this for my kid and it got stuck on the welcome screen  minutes after it arrived actual garbagestopped working after  minutes
21,4,not as fast as i would have liked but easy to use and great for the casual charge at the office or homegood wireless charger
4780,2,the lights themselves are greatthey are bright enough without going too hot if you need something really bright you need something elsei use those within a salon setting shooting video and its plenty bright for thatwhen you look with the naked eye they dont seem to brighten up much but when your are looking in your camera you can see the difference they fill in skin nicely for a smooth looknow the flawthe small slide in adapters that are used to attach a cold shoe mount or  mount are way too loosei almost dropped the light on someones face after that i had to use it with a phone holder clamp style holder and a white hair bandi guess for they price i shouldnt complain but just know what you are gettingyou will need a secure way to mount these lights and it is not provided with the lights you will need to spend more for thatbecause of that design flaw i cant recommend them however i already bought them so ill keep using themgreat but one flaw tho
8800,1,pictures always turns out very dark and poor qualitypoor picture quality
4528,1,single camera videos are not even full hd there is always a noisy video quality under water shots are so weird if you are moving with it you will headache when you watch that video on big screen only  feature works better so its not worth it to pay that much for just one featurepoor video stabiliser poor under water video quality
3303,2,the camera arrived without a memory card even though it indicated on the box that the memory card was included the camera was a gift for my niece for her birthday and due to a later than expected delivery date i had wrapped the camera immediately upon arrival and didnt inspect the contents first so we didnt realize there was no memory card until she opened it at her birthday party we were able to get her a memory card the next day and she is now enjoying the camera very much had we not been on vacation without access to a computer i would have tried to return it for a refund and purchased another camera elsewherememory card not included
2337,1,for a camera that is made for kids this doesnt hold up my daughter was in love with this product until the screen cracked on vacation and she could no longer see the photos cant find a way to contact the seller but hoping for a replacementscreen broke the first day
14313,5,cooking perfect rice cant get any easier controls are intuitive and easy to manipulate exterior handle makes it convenient to move the main thing of course how is the rice every batch so far been excellent no hot spots causing browning evenly hydrated and cooked throughout the batch no complaints lots of praiseperfect rice every time
3713,1,not as bright as described it will only be kind of bright for about  minutes then it starts becoming dim i tried a few batteries fully charged with the same results its got some kind of problem and it eats up batteries like crazydim
11115,5,prefect rice cooker we use this all the time cooks prefect rice in under  saves time and great tasterice
10465,5,if you grew up asian cooking rice in a rice cooker is simple wash rice drain add more water finger method to see how much water to put put pot in rice cooker and hit the cook button this allows you to not have a giant rice cooker taking up space in your kitchen or be obligated to eat mounds of rice at a time just enough for two meals for meal prep or for two people comes with rice fluffer and measuring cup if the finger method is a foreign concept and so easy to wash and put away afterwards huzzah for technology and the best priced seriously check it out for your buck rice cookerworks great amazing price
8570,2,thought this camera had a great pictured but i have only used it about  times went to go use it today and nothing it quit working altogether of course it is too late to return it wish it would have lastedcamera quit working after  months
8481,1,the description may say usa but i received the euro version that included the euro plug had to run to the store and shell out more money to buy an adapter in order to charge the batterybuyers beware
7128,1,the spine cracked the plastic is not durable get a different one dont waste your moneynot durable
5310,2,had the camera less than  days and my fiance accidentally let the camera bump on the table and the whole lenze felt out and unfortunately it didnt not work tried to send it back but unfortunately it was our problemit breaks easily
8967,1,the camera was a blurry when i first got it  has not improved despite all tweaks googled ughpictures blurry
6288,2,as others have said the product has a weird design and it feels like its going to fall apart weird hinging movementmy main issue is that the integration into adobe camera raw just doesnt work adobe camera raw will not recognise the file format and allow camera profiles to be created  this effectively renders it useless for photoshop users what i find unforgivable is the fact that the supporting website has instructions for the  version of photoshop  acr version  we are now on acr version  this is ridiculoususing this with lightroom was much easier but it means that i have to open images in lightroom and apply changes to the raw file and then finish the edit in photoshop not a deal breaker but if like me you are a photoshop user and not a lightroom user then you may find it annoying luckily  i cant imagine using this on every shoot  it will be for specific assignmentscalibrite  update your product website the support guides and videos are far from adequate 
7508,2,play video pros small very transportable fun to use  relatively easy to use lots of extra accessories providedcons quality barely better than a  webcam  seems like a high price for this mobile app is very buggy  doesnt work basically unusable when lighting isnt super brightif you care about the quality of the footage  images id recommend saving up for a better camera this is more like a toy i am returning thisfor transparency i also found a slip included in my order that basically said leave a review and well give you all this free stuff  so im not sure how biased previous  star reviews may be just be wary and use your best judgement think about what you can get for  and whether the quality in this product meets your expectationsthis camera is good or bad depending on what your use case is  your mileage may vary for me i wanted a fun little camera to record memories with my cats or when im traveling on vacation i liked the idea of having a small little point and shoot video camera  both for size and also for storage space ive been running out of space on my phone for videos i think this would be a good dash camera or biking camera where youre just trying to record general footage and dont mind so much about the quality of minor details this may also be good for underwater footage but this hasnt been testedbad quality with many accessories to overcompensate dont trust all positive reviews
2469,1,poor quality wasted money no good photos from europe triptoo late to return
10507,4,im not a real big race eater but when i do make it i want it to be easy and this does the job for meconvenient
663,2,i bought this camera to use for work i needed clear picture of instrumentation and i would say at least  of the photos i took were blurry even with the autofocus the description of this camera sounded great but ultimately it was a disappointment also the battery dies quicklyunclear photos
4895,1,i got this camera for my bridge inspection crew to use  photo quality is very poor on anything other than well lit scenery shotsit does not take good photos in shade or in telephoto mode basically they were a waste of money i have returned to using my cell phone as a camerapoor photo quality
5335,1,received this camera as a birthday gift from a friend and we were both disappointed when it wouldnt even turn on its presented as a new item but we suspect it was repackaged and sold as new the lens sticker that came with the camera was already applied and the batteries were already in the camera also the description said there would be two extra film packs which were missing and some other little baubles were also missing happy birthday to me i guesscamera didnt work missing items
3272,1,this sucks only had this for  months hardly used it and now the focusing motor is jammed or something jesus youd think for the money i spent thered a be warranty or somethingwaste of  plus shipping
13232,5,there was always a when we used it the cord stopped working after a few months but would work if we jiggled it it no longer works at allbecame difficult to use in  months completely broke in  months
8031,1,neither of the two units purchased worked spent couple hrs on with fiji and they confirmed both times that they were broken unitshave given uphave ordered two and returned both
2362,1,there is only one setting the flash is always on you cannot take photos in the daylight or anywhere near sunlight this camera costs more than the other versions that have settings for light exposure its big bulky costs more and does less that the other cameras they make i want to exchange this horrible mistaketerrible photos
624,1,good price and qualitygood camera
692,2,cheap as in not good qualitycheap
8352,1,it did not have he external flash like it says it hasi geuss nobody caresmessing the flash i guess that dont care
9119,2,this isnt a standard classic polaroid film pack  theres no battery so if you stick it in an old polaroid youll be out of luck its for newfangled polaroids with a different battery system if you have one of those im sure itll be  well spentread the description carefully  not compatible with vintage polaroid cameras
4861,1,that i was shorted product and the add is very misleadingyou will be shorted film
1074,1,terrible cheap cameraterrible cheap camera
7306,1,i bought the refurbished gopro hero  i was able to get it to record once while in camp but was not able to get it to record during the event that i bought it for so it was a bust very disappointed as i wanted to get some footagerefurbished not good
7762,2,very cheap plastic better for a kid  certainly not  plastic
3596,1,play video was full charged  minutes ago and now no battery againbattery dies every  minutes
534,1,wouldnt hold a charge returned itone star
8437,1,pictures come out awful looking into another brand heard if you keep the original color calibration sheet that you can use other brands will be looking into canon because this is unacceptable will returnawful
8153,1,i bought this to do double duty as a dash cam as well as a camera for cycling for usage as a dash cam it will definitely work to show who was at fault in an accident but the quality is too bad to make out a license plate other than in very specific circumstancesfor cycling i wanted it both as assurance that if the worst happens and i get in an accident either me or my family would be able to grab a license plate in the case of a hit and run and just for taking video that i can share with friends and family to show them nice landscapes and environments i bike through the quality is way too bad for either purpose i replaced it with another cheaper action camera that takes  video that is stabilized too the only thing this has over that one is battery life aerodynamic shapeall the battery life in the world doesnt matter though if i cant see anything in the picture so this is absolutely not worth itsave your money
5396,2,the camera keeps saying it cant read the sd cardsd card issue
5916,1,i loved it at first but after having it for only about  months it refuses to print i get an error message of the paper not going in right every time i try to print a photo so i have to take it all out put it one piece and put it all back and hope i havent ruined the film pretty disappointedstopped working after a short time
3461,2,i bought it as a backup for my polaroid but it has very poor picture quality you get maybe very few good pictures definitely not great very very blurry get the polaroid its worth the money and the pictures are way betterpoor picture quality
4918,1,cheaply made cannot close and lock easily or securely with battery and sd card doesnt lock or unlock easily the sliding button failed after three attempts as did the lock button wouldnt trust for precious moments water was in camera after first usedont buy
10486,4,"i have made a few of the recipes in the owners manual it comes with the biggest problem is that stuff does spill over the cover doesnt really stop it i can safely make a  brown rice without it spilling overthe banana bread recipe is good but it is a little effort to flip it use parchment paper to try and get the uncooked dough to stay on the bottom of the flipped bread to place back in the cooker for further cookinggood for more than rice"
8052,2,at around two dollars a picture it is absolutely maddening when you are trying to take a picture and you repeatedly get an overexposed or underexposed result i fully admit that as a  i am used to hightech cameras that produce a good picture every time it may be that the consistently overexposed and underexposed pictures that come out of the polaroid now plus its simply a limitation of the technology and that is what is to be expected when taking an instant photograph however at the steep cost of the camera and the film i would avoid buying thisalmost impossible to get a picture to expose correctly
542,1,firmware makes this camera impossible to use turns on showing a white screen most of the time if you get past that screen and use telephoto do not use the half way down shut button to focus the camera locks has to be turned off tried to initialize the camera now i cannot get out of that screen even removing the batteries does not help two day old camera is going back never again sonyneeds zero star rating
212,1,terrible customer service deceitful company terrible customer service
7383,1,this product did not do what they advertised the images come out small hard to see 
9567,4,"love this i should have gotten a bigger one lolif you cant make rice to save your lifenow you can definitely recommend "

7749,1,ive bought couple of these cameras they worked fine in the beginning and my kids enjoyed them but after few hours of use the battery doesnt hold charge and they constantly turn off unfortunately cannot return it as the return window just closed and im stuck with a useless toydont last long
1027,1,do not get this  wish i could get a refund i got the right micro sd card and charged it fully and when it was finished charging i tried to turn it on and it never worked i tried everything it only turns on when it is plugged in charging which wont work when actually taking pictures i took it to italy super excited to take photos and am very sad  i guess theres a reason it was so cheapdoesnt turn on
7814,1,the item i received was already torn it is made out of a cheap plastic on the outside the inside was fine but i wish they made it more durable was not happy with this productplastic cover
4117,2,i have single arlo camera set up and controlled by alexa view bought as package camera works well and i really like the fact that i can view camera just by asking alexa view to show me the camera however i cant access or view the camera using either my iphone or ipad because i cant log in to the arlo app it tells me i have the wrong password or email so i tried the forgot password link and received an email with link to click to reset password the link only brings up the arlo logo with no option to click anywhere on the screen ive tried using iphone and ipads without success ive gone back and tried using the forgot password option again with the same results i tried using my imac to log onto the arlo and get the same screen as when trying to access via iphoneipad tried calling tech support number listed on reset password email phone constantly busy sent  emails using the reply option on the reset password email none have been acknowledged  hours and counting the only good thing is that i can still access and view the camera using alexa view because it remembers the password but not being able to use my other mobile devices is not acceptableim hoping that by posting a poor review on amazon that  others will be aware of a possible issue and  arlo support will actually respond to this posting and i can get my problem resolvedso why didnt i give them a one star rating because the camera and interface with alexa view is really good to the point i was going to add additional cameras until i ran into this problem im attaching the screen display i get when trying to log onpoor support actually no support  password reset issue two days and counting
6946,1,i was so excited to get this camera as many of my friends have the mini one and i wanted a bigger picture like the ones that were around when i was a kid i read the directions and put the batteries it came with in and the camera lit up but the lens wouldnt come out i tried turning it off and on various times i changed the batteries to duracell batteries and this seemed to work because the lens came out however when i tried taking pictures all the film came out black i also noticed a small scratch on the cameras exterior as if it had been used im really disappointed because i was so excited to get this camera and was not able to use it luckily the return was hassle free i may be open to purchasing again but in store so i could try it out before i buylike the ones that were around when i was a

13771,5,"i am very picky on rice cooker i had zojiroshi panasonic rice cookers in the past zojiroshi is the best by far but then i figured out my own way to cook the perfect rice i will explain at the endfor this mini one here is what i experienced pros and conspro size perfect for tow person who dont eat rice very often but only prefer perfect cooked rice if you have more than two people try a larger size it is perfect for apartment living inner pot is thick it results evenly cooked rice power cord i also have an instant pot i always unplug the cord leave it a side to store it they have the same port so i just plug in same cord into rice cooker no need to worry about organizing two cords simple menu no need to many options less is beauty price i bought amazon renewed one really good condition just like new looks like it was never used before far cheaper than other brandscons touch buttons are very sensitive no big deal will get used to it just be careful each time when closing the lid avoid to touch the button areahere is what i learned i always love how zojiroshi cooked the rice but i am really on budget this time so i researched all over the internet about how to cook rice correctly including sushi rice basmati jasminehere is the key points i can cook a perfect pot of rice by using any rice cooker wash rivne your rice  times until the water is clear soaking the rice in cold water for  minutes the leaving the soaked rice in room temperature for  minutes use the rice cooker has thick inner pot this result the even heating add the correct amount of water different rice is different i have to try twice to find out the amount of water ratio for my sushi rice brandafter that you can always get the best result if you want to skip all these get a zojiroshi neuro logic model rice cooker it will do all these for you automatically no other model can makes it so rightagain i love my new toshiba mini rice cooker just perfect for meexcellent rice cooker"
3288,2,charger doesnt work after taking it offcamera
5476,1,i have owned this camera for less than a year i bought it as a present for my girlfriend in february of  and now in november of  i have been told by a professional photographer and several bird photographers to give up once the zoom error message pops upthe bottom line zoom no longer functions which has thoroughly compromised the ability to focus the camera on birds near or far and several camera folk have told me to give up and buy a new camera evidently the zoom motor on this camera is particularly vulnerable to dust and compromise requires very expensive fixes in contrast i got  years out of every other power zoom camera i have ever boughtit is probably against amazon policy to suggest alternative brands but i will not be replacing this with another panasonic lumixzoom motor subject to too many issues
10489,5,i love this use it all the time never burns the rice and comes out perfect every timeeasy
3943,1,i ordered this camera for my daughters birthday on the day of the holiday she opened the gift and was very disappointed because she could not put the camera in the case because the case was not sewn correctly we were very disappointed the holiday was ruined check what you sell to peopledefective thing do not recommend to buy
7860,2,a polaroid would be better it is a good idea though but i always have to adjust the colors and lighting for it to turn out decent i love the sticker ideas too but it is annoying to play around and not be sure how it will turn out till its done i might just give it to the teacher since we usually print pictures for craftspoor quality
5304,1,the software makes it so time consuming to use the camera that after owning a dozen nikons over  years i will never purchase anotheri am really depressed i spent so much money on this camera
373,1,doesnt take photos after a few times of use just a black screen guess you get what you pay forstopped working completely
8235,1,despite high expectations i was unable  even after contacting support  to link it into my wifi 
7368,1,complete junk it is smaller than the mage would lead you to believe and it is so poorly designed that the gooseneck would not support the weight of the headjust junk
711,2,the pictures are not that great kinda hard to usenot that great
8187,1,after only a few weeks of use it started freezing while filming and had to be reset each time then the cheap metal pin broke off inside the camera and ruined itwaste of money
1678,1,this camera is completely trash and then the company does not want to give your money back please do not waste your time and your energy on this itembuyer beware
1069,1,camera quality is bad and when trying to upload videos to pc the videos will not loadnot a great idea to buy
6989,1,this review is tricky i purchased the camera as well as a protective case from amazon in january  within  months the flash cover had disappeared somehow it popped off without us noticing and within  months the entire camera had jammed my daughter is a camera junky who treats her cameras very well but even with that this camera seems poorly designed and it doesnt seem very durable if the camera was well built this would be an easy  stars but it isnt built wellcomplete junk w poor quality and design
11212,5,i love cute things that are also beneficial i was looking for a ceramic rice cooker and it was wonderful to find this its super easy to clean and i love that it automatically shuts off when the timer is finished and i like how the timer lets me know when my rice will be ready the previous rice cooker i had didnt have that feature and would continue cooking until i manually turned it off which isnt safe around my cat who likes to jump on countersefficient safe and cute
1864,2,had to return blinking light on front means it needs repair all my pictures were blurry blue washed out and overexposed good sunlight and it still looked like it was in a dark room side by side comparison with a photo taken from a mini  she took this one with my boyfriend and i and it was fantastic thats what made me want to buy one of these i think it may be better to go with the mini  as they are the same however i think my camera was a return or the oldest inventory it should have never had a blinking light on day two and my pictures should somewhat look like the box disappointed but not giving up maybe buy from the manufacturer dont wait to return it if you dont get semi clear photosi think my camera was bad
3935,2,the product is exactly as expected made a nice gift for my son however instead of a green camera with a green casealbum we got a purple case and albumgood product  if we had gotten the right color
6050,2,comes with no directions r u kidding meno directions
7298,1,so these cameras are password protected and can not get it to connect to the computer due to not having the password i will change my rating if you can fix the problemdont buy unless they give you the wifi password or its useless
3709,1,where the battery mounts it doesnt hold it in securely it moves around some and this makes it flicker i tried the wobbly table method ie shoving a little piece of folded paper in to stop it from shaking this kind of helped but not enough to make it work like it shouldbattery mount faulty
4249,1,its not a good camera even for kids the quality of photos are very low even though it has been advertised for  quality the battery dies in  mins i will upload sample photos and videos do not waste your money on thisits not good even for kids
6267,2,unfortunately it just doesnt help me  too big for my nikon   too difficult to see through to the viewfinder  nearly impossible to dial in focus on lens when its in the covernot right for me
8029,1,the light is on but i couldnt connect to my phone and it doesnt work even i do full charged for battery one of the films come along with this printer is broken at least i can return itdoesnt work at all
7246,1,i had a go pro hero  for many years and never a problem the hero  is a cheaply made plastic camera with a plastic plug that covers the recharge ports this cover is hard plastic and snaps over the open ports problem is the snap is non existent and the cover does not stay on when camera is out of the case ordered a new cover  now the camera beeps  times when turning it on and  times when turning it off normal operation when i try to turn it on again it beeps  times and does not turn on numerous attempts with the same results this was a used  very good  everything works and was checked dont buy a hero  this is the poorest review ive made and it deserves itworked for about an hour
7733,1,this camera is junk this thing should be  bucks not  it comes with a charging cord but nothing to plug it into seriously for  dollars you could give a plug with it and you cant replace the rechargeable battery found that out while reading the instructions its cheap plastic im going to try and send it back dont waste your money on this this is not worth  dollarsdont buy this camera
5839,1,this camera will not connect to wifi out of the box you need a firmware update and the only way to get that onto the computer is to copy onto an sd card if you want wifi out of the box buy another camerawifi needs firmware update and sd card reader
4922,1,i have spent about  worth of micro sd chips and the camera can not seem to format any of them its like it doesnt ready the micro sd cardnot worth it
6939,1,terrible on my  one and its already broken on the first pack of film im out probably  at this point including  one broke on the  use they wouldnt let me return it to walmart because it was an online item then i was told i waited too long i stupidly purchased another one because i specifically wanted it for a trip i was going on that one broke the week before my trip wouldnt just let me exchange so i went on my trip without it i sent it in and had it repairedfinally i have it back put film in  shots in solid black maybe its the film put a new pack in nope its the camera what a waste of money super unfortunate and of course now its out of warranty againif you like flushing  down the toilet this is the camera for you
2548,1,bought one for each of my kids for christmas they absolutely loved them but within a month my sons camera would not power on unless it was plugged in you cannot print pictures while its plugged in so it was rendered useless it was within the return window so i replaced it hoping it was a fluke now my daughters camera is doing the same thing and its outside of the return window such a bummer as the kids really did love them but too expensive of a gift to not even last  months very disappointedwe havent used my sons replacement camera yet but now only one kid has a camera that they each received as a giftquits working within  months 
7924,1,great product appearance and price however it just does not work and worst the remote seems to work even less i turned on ok remote cannot turn the camera on but getting it to record with one button push was impossible however if you push the button several times to get the recording icon to turn red you will have several  files created if any at all if you need to take a video of your family friends or performances you cant take  minutes to get it to record if it ever does amazon refunded my purchase price without any questions and when i reviewed past reviews most people report having the same or similar issuesthe cameras firmware does not work consistently and instructions are figureitout
610,1,you can tell right off the bat it is a very cheap camera many of these reviews led me astray its definitely not worth the pricenot worth it
4359,1,such a cool gift if only the quality was better i bought the blue one for my grandson and after less than two months of intermittent use it wont turn on at all they no longer have the blue color listed so i cant even try to get a refund very disappointingawesome until it stopped working less than two months later
6750,2,the price of this paper was good but the quality of the pictures is not i got this paper because i couldnt find refills for the vtech kidizoom printcam as you can see from the picture the quality of this paper compared to the original is not good it is also quite a bit thinner than the vtech paper this paper is fine if your kid just wants to do a bunch of printing and doesnt care about the quality of the picturegrainy pictures when used with vtech kidizoom printcam
924,1,wow this has been the most upsetting amazon week ever odered a computer that is refurbished trash then get this camera which is new but has no company name that makes it so you cant youtube any information the quality isnt worth what you pay i tried to stream with it and it causes buffering even with the hdmi card patch this was great  years ago i blame myself lesson learneddont do it
4621,2,now it disconnects randomlyworked great for  months
5387,1,play video ive tried and tried to get this camera to format and it wont and thats after going online and trying to do it the way it was recommended time to go back to amazonmy sd card will not format for nothing
2479,1,didnt work i ended up returning for a full refunddidnt work
1051,1,hard to believe that the picture quality can be so bad it is not better than the first digital camera i bought  years ago do not know who gave the all five star review did they get a different onei am surprised by the bad picture quality
8918,1,warning this product is junk did not work from the box newwont charge wont turn on wont take pictures amazon only refunded  of my moneyno tec supportjunk no tec support website said they dont make it
5688,2,play video well my camera worked fine but when i try to use these the pictures dont take it could be my camera thats why i gave it a  but my camera worked perfect with the last set i had in iti even layer them over a light too see id they would brighten upi dont know
706,2,its terrible do not buy this or any cheap camera on here i bought to use for work to replace having to use my personal phone i ended up using my phone anyway instead of this because the results are so badthis thing just sucks
14897,4,having previously owned two other much higher priced electric rice cookers i decided to go lowendno frills and i am very satisfied with this product the best part is that this unit is small  real small it takes up a tiny amount of counter space and is real easy to take off the shelf and use whenever needed the keep warm feature works fine as well the only downside is that the user must use small quantities of rice although it can probably handle five or more cups of uncooked rice if you go higher than two cups youll contend with steaming overflow vent liquid whenever the unit hits its highest cooking tempgreat appliance for the price
10495,5,very happy with the productcute
5381,2,the camera looks great but the film didnt come with it so we have yet to try it as it was a christmas gift i would recommend buying extra film to avoid disappointment 
17585,5,"the neuro fuzzy model served us well for  years but was started to cook and keep warm inconsistently the pot and heating plate surfaces had to be very clean and smooth or the rice would get over cooked and dry out the also dented easythe induction heating model pot is much more heavy duty since it has to have iron for the induction to work white brown and short grain sticky rice have all been cooked perfectly and rice was still good when kept warm for  hours it is worth the extra  for something we use just about every daysturdy"
4348,2,after first use the grey loop on top of bag ripped off on one side thought it was no big deal kept using it second time using it the whole chest strap separated on one side so now i have a bag that will give out on me at any moment while using itgreat bag if product held up to use
7719,1,we bought this for our  yo son birthday what seem to be a durable and age appropriate kid camera didnt live up to expectations the screen was not working after only a month and a half making the camera unusable even when working it was a headache understanding how to use it the only good think is the responsiveness and customer service from this merchantcomplicated and not durable
4436,2,returned the framecolors were washed out saturation hue and brightness controls were not able to correct the problempictures were not crisp pixel count seems low for the size of the frameken burns effect was a disappointment movement was not smoothpicture seemed to vibrate hard to look at the pan and zoom wasmechanical and unrelated to content of pictures we have a smallerframe that integrates ken burns pan with face recognition had assumedthat would be the case with this frame but it was notreturned the frame
2048,1,im returning the product because the film is expired and i dont want to chance it not workingfilm expired  months ago
6715,1,shipped from amazon us to hongkongpros its light which is what i wantedcons beware of quality its no different from a  bagbought brand new but received mine in returned opened box fashion the protective plastic was opened with return labels stuck onto itno damage on the bag itself so no matter right well upon inspection the front compartment was wonky no matter how you fill the bag it will look lopsided and very unpleasing to look at its not symmetrical the bottom of the bad has some thick cardboard to keep it flat but mine was folded and will never bend straight againthe separators dont stick very well actually kind of uselessbasically an overrated bag by content creators i should have known betterunfortunately their return policy for international is all sales are finalyou dont get what you paid for
5990,1,ugh  i bought this camera for my daughter who is traveling in the galapagos on day two of its use the screen cracked for no apparent reason now she doesnt have an underwater camera apparently this screen cracking issue is common based on the gopro chat roomsdont buy without reading this
6389,1,i gave it too much credit as i never got a first use from it after inserting an sd card it told me i still needed to put in a memory card hmmm i was at my desk and so many sd cards were on hand so i thought that maybe it had been launched out by the spring by mistake but after inserting carefully a second one and getting the same message again i gave the camera a couple of firm shakes and could hear a faint rattle the sound of my sd cards inside since each sd card had photos i was unwilling to send the camera back andoomlearned a lesson at the cost of  is not gbnoing to keep working unless it is treated delicately
860,1,the camera worked the first time i used it since then the camera does not work there will be film in the camera and the orange light just continues to flash after trying to take a picture i tried to call the support line to see if i could get a new camera and it said they werent able to take my call waste of moneywaste of money
3772,2,the print in the instructions was so small i had to use a magnifying glass it did come with two batteries however i had to play around with the controls a lot until i finally figured out how to format the sd card directions tell you it must be formatted first but give no instructions on how to do so they need to have an english speaker help with the translation so it makes sensewho wrote these instructions
1132,1,i think i already did a review on this but as i use this camera it takes good quality pictures and videos but the lies that ppl tell in these reviews is what bothers me the battery and the camera no matter how much you keep it charged or charge it the battery drains very quickly no matter how long you keep it on the charger it doesnt last long for use smh i guess you get what you pay for i knew the camera was to good to be true for the price for what it is smhdisappointed
9304,1,poor quality received the product damaged box is okay light duty outside casingpoor quality received the product damaged box is okay
6454,1,this is a very disappointing product despite it being so small which i was kinda excited about the picture quality is not good at all and there are a lot of limitations to it i had it too long that i couldnt return it so it was money that went right into the trash my advice buy something a little more pricier because in this case you honestly get what you paid foryou get what you pay for
523,1,takes terrible picturesterrible
4763,2,just bright to look atnot enough light
497,2,the quality is not too goodi expected better
13,5,works perfectly as advertised make sure you use a fast charging usb wall adapter for the full fast charging experience charged my iphone  from  to  in less than  minutes  starsworks like a charm
8501,2,hardly lasted more than a yearokay
3549,2,if filming in  at  the camera over heats in  you can only use their app since the desktop app was put as legacy software and is no longer updated this means you cant login with your google account if pulling the files directly from the sd card it loses the orientation light flicker is horrible and film is very grainy even at  their app on the tablet is even bad as it doesnt hold orientation when flipping horizontally better off using a dslr to film at  because it will look that much better film stabilization is the only good thing about the cameranot real  video
11208,5,works very well andninlike the one buttonperfect size  no need for useless programming
5371,1,does not work its not turning on so disappointing and most the reviews are saying the same thing but its an amazon choice wowwwwdoes not work
8983,2,the pictures come out hard to seepictures kind of dark  gloomy
2535,2,this camera looks so cute really simple easy to use my down side is the camera is too big for small children it is difficult for them to hold the camera  also the photo quality isnt the best  the kids were looking forward to seeing the photo but they were disappointed that it was blurry i personally would not be happy paying the price for this so for this reason i would not recommend im gutted because this is not what i expectedthe photo doesnt look good
7056,1,i do not ever leave reviews but this camera is awful maybe i just got a bad one i dont know but there was lines on every image i printed i tried cleaning it like google suggested changing the paper nothing helped the image quality is also terrible i would just stick with the fuji film if i were younot worth the money
8755,1,from the start of getting this polaroid it wouldnt eject any of the pictures so i sent it back for an exchange shortly after receiving the  polaroid the pictures it took was terrible the attached photos are proof that this is just not a functional camera let alone a polaroid as an individual with a background in design and photographyvideography im aware of parameters to take a great photo the lighting is optimal in most if not all photos and this polaroid is just all around a bad investment they also advised me that they would actually refund my money in return for the hassle but low and behold i noticed a charge on my credit card last night for the polaroid i definitely wont be buying a new polaroid and will be sticking to the older gens they seem to work without any problems and i would highly advise to stay away from this specific modelworst polaroid experience
3321,1,it was a christmas gift and only time it turns on is if its plugged indont work
2595,1,i loved the pink camera and the set it came with but the camera stopped working after one day of use i thought it just needed a break so i stopped using it and when i went back the next day it was not working and in the process of testing it out much of my film was wastedthe camera stopped working after one day of use
7242,1,this gopro was used one time and it died it stopped working its six month after i purchased it and i still dont have a replacement because i purchased it as a christmas gift i lost the replacement window with the amazon reseller so i was forced to go to gopro customer service which is horrible gopro support has given me the runaround by not getting all the information they need and then sending me multiple emails requesting additional information they sent me a new batter finally at the end of april to see if that would work and as soon as the battery shipped they closed my case the new battery did not work ive spent a lot of time just trying to get customer support on the phone again because its seems impossible to set up a new case online its frustration and anger that no consumer should have experience after spending  for a tiny product that does not work never again i will not purchase high end electronic devices for christmas gifts on amazon unless the return policy period is at lease  months and even then that is questionable ive read other reviews out on the internet and have seen the same complaints from other consumers next time ill pay closer attentionbad product and horrible gopro product support
5343,1,i do not recommend this product we had a hard time getting it turn straight out of the box after placing brand new batteries and changing those batteries to make sure it wasnt the battery it wasnt the batteries eventually got it to turn on and snapped a couple of pics fast forward two months went to turn it on today after adding new batteries and changing those new batteries to make sure it wasnt the batteries well it wasnt the batteries this camera is a piece of junk save your money wish i could returnstopped working after second use
13430,5,i measured the plastic cup that came with the rice cooker because i know its going to get lost it held  of an american cup rather than convert the japaneses measurements to american   american cups of dry rice to   american cups of water  i used the tried and true formula from my old rice cooker  american cups of well washed basmati rice and  american cups of water when the rice was finished it was perfectly cooked and gently pressed up against the glass top so it turns out that the  cup japanese rice cooker was able to make the same  american cups of basmati rice dry  ymmvok heres the deal on making rice using american cup meausrments  cup version
2570,1,camera is cute and takes decent pictures but broke one week after my daughter having itbroke after one week
8976,1,i received this camera as a christmas present i tried to use it for taking pictures at my sons basketball games but the pictures turn out blurry every time no matter what setting i have it on i only used it  times now when i try to turn it on it beeps and turns off i tried charging it i take the lens cover off and nothing it still wont turn on not to mention the app you are supposed to use doesnt work either i would not recommend to anyoneonly used  times and now it wont even turn on
1456,1,poorly translated instruction manual difficult to figure out how to operate complete junkjunk
6299,1,like a toy returned it for that reasonpoor quality
6803,2,the camera worked great when it was on but ive changed the batteries twice and it dies after ten minutes ive tried using the cable to charge it and nothing trying to return itdoesnt hold charge
2486,1,this camera is one of the very worst it wont focus video is blurry sending it backabsolutely terrible  focus is horrible
6953,1,the film got jammed every time i used it couldnt get it to take a single picturedidnt work
11084,5,great little rice cooker its perfect for one person its very userfriendly and the steamer basket is a plus would buy againgreat little rice cooker
8908,1,the image quality is horrible even after adjusting settings and setting to highest possible image quality its poor both for still images and for video my  old pointandshoot sony camera performed much better in several tests that i tried even though the old camera is lower pixels lower resolution etc also the wifi doesnt work and the manual has so many grammar errors its hard to read i am definitely returning this piece of junkwould give this negative starts if i could
3545,2,camera overheats and shuts down in just  min and refuses to record again for more than  min and then  min before totally shutting down for good fyi battery still had more than  battery life  i will continue testing it before deciding whether to return it recording time is a major concern if it cant do the jobanother concern  as new batteries  battery will only charge up to   drops to  after a few min of non usage wasnt even powered upcamera shuts down after  min continuous shooting
4417,2,this is an update to a previous review where i rated this product a  however when i stopped being able to access my account online for managing the frame i contacted pixstar and was told that the account was broken and i should reregister the frame in response i asked if i would lose all our photo emails if i reregistered the frame and then i was told to log into the account hellllo the problem is i cant i tried inquiring on their facebook account and was given a different email address so i tried again and low and behold i got an email from the same agent with the same initial response  its broken i cant find a number to call and cant get anyone else to respond horribleno customer service there has to be a better way to get a question answered if i were rating customer service i would only give one star but because the frame is good i kept a couple starsgreat device until     something goes wrong
6157,1,i wouldnt recommend buying it  its not an original kodak photos look blurrybad buy
7828,2,sadly going to give it  stars for now will update if things change i didnt care if the color was off or not it is indeed off on the yellow spectrum but thats cool bc it looks like how i imagine sentimental photos to look anyway sadly ive wasted like  sheets of this expensive zink paper it was only printing a partial photo like as if it wasnt feeding the paper through properly im not sure if i finally fixed that problem or not seems ok the last  times though i ended up turning the printer off restarting my phone and reloading the paperanother issue which is why  stars instead of  or  is that the pictures have lines on them now this cant be an inkink head issue like traditional printers bc this technology does not use ink so i dont know what thats abouti really wanted to love this and i will keep trying but annoyed right now and googling hasnt helpedhas potential
8556,1,after a few uses and a lot of fun this camera started doing weird things and making strange noises also the viewfinder is way off it was off from the start i would take a picture of someone in the middle of the frame and then it would develop and they would look a lot farther away and off to one side so if it was a portrait half their face would be cut off completely im a huge composition nut so this ruins everything ive stopped using it waste of money and it is at the bottom of my junk bin where it belongsterrible product
3956,1,ii buy this camera for my niecewe try togheter and first picture was nicethen camera stop working every picture come blackfujifilm
4872,1, the photographs are very pale  and too small i dont likeis not good
4782,1,well it was fun while it lasted a fine little economical light from february  until april  when it died in fact the red led lights indicating the charge level are now always on but dim and the main led lights wont turn on at all plugged into usb or not so much for that not an easy way to contact the manufacturer eithergreat for  weeksthen kaput
5570,1,it didnt work unfortunately thats why i need to return it i bought it specifically for our disneyland trip and couldnt use it when i brought it for our vacationdidnt work
14836,4,"i think i would purchase a unit next time that had a different button for grainsriceetc this unitis simple and works but not sure i would purchase it again a bit of water overflow into lidone switch"
14311,5,"easy to use easy to clean and cooking rice is so easytaking it apart to clean only takes two minutes and one minute to get it cookingit does take  minutes to cook though but not really a issue with mestart it before you start cooking any thing else this cooker will keep your rice hot for hoursso when you are ready to start cooking your meal it will be there waiting for youa bit pricey i just wish i had one sooner less mess not fussthis cooker makes rice perfect every time"
4983,1,i ordered this camera for my granddaughters birthday and it came in with stickers on the camera batteries and film in the camera camera did not work i cant get a refund because its past  days i never thought about opening the box before i gave it to her on  very disappointed ti say the least and i buy a lot of stuff from amazonjust terrible i paid a lot of money for this item and cant return it
3540,2,this is a decent action camera at  fps if you go above  fps on any resolution the camera will quickly overheat whats the point of having high level features if you cant even use themalso i have never bought an electronic that cant properly tell its own battery level sometimes gets stuck at  when charging all the bugs around charging and the battery are concerningmost features useless clearly buggy almost a gimmick
1815,2,i had an older install and loved it after  years of owning it  it jammed and i was unable to fix it so i bought the updated version it seems no matter how still i am taking the photo half of the time my photos come out with motion blur this never used to happen with my old instax not super happy with my purchase since they arent cheappictures are blurry most of the time
7840,2,i loved this little printer when i first bought it i utilized it frequently for my scrapbooking and it wasnt as costly when compared to taking polaroid pictures over time i did start to have issues there would be sheets in it and it would say it was empty id have to lay it down a certain way or refill it before it was out now my biggest dislike is my picture come out with an orange tint it takes away from pictures and i dont like it at all ive tried different film and adjusting the colors but its still a problemstarted off strong but now will be looking for a replacement
7783,1,camera broke after a few months just wont turn oncrap dont buy
2046,2,they say white is right but when it comes to this instant print camera white must be wrong because this camera hasnt worked correctly since the time i powered it on first it would only stay on for a few minutes then it couldnt be bothered to turn off when i took a picture the paper would jam and come out deformedwhite one doesnt work
4601,1,came broken wont let me post a negative review so i will keep reposting no resolutionbroken
16954,5,the rice pot is heavy duty and will last a long time i have purchased many different rice cookers in the past and this one tops them allbest rice cooker i ever had
6551,2,the autofocus is very slow in focusing on an object by the time it focuses the grandchild has moved to another location and then you are waiting for the focus to happen again but the biggest complaint is that when i zoom in to take a picture of an object the picture is out of focus i have to hold the camera totally still for the picture to be slightly focused with my mom being older she will never be able to hold the camera that still and get a focused picture when using the zoom also i am concerned with the engineering of the battery compartment it is located on the bottom of the camera and you slide out a thin plastic lid load the batteries and the sd card and it slides back on the left side you have to put pressure where the batteries are to get it to slide i am not sure that thin plastic lid will hold up with the pressure of the batteries over the next  years for  i thought it would be a better camera a good cell phone camera would take just as good and probably better picturesi bought this camera for my mother
2453,1,never buy never buy these productsthese are cheating products not at all   always difficult to focus and it did not focus on two persons one person is always blurrywhen i take a group picture i had to take minimum of  pics to make sure i get one good also the click button is very hard giving a shake of its ownit is called  mp but cheated us it was only around  mp max hope this is helpfulhigh recommending not to buy not at all good for family eventsi am trashing this productnever buy these kind of products not at all good for family events not a 
1475,1,this is garbage it is pretty much a hallowed out plastic box missing half the stuff that should of came with it wont charge its a plastic box with a light in itthis is garbage
7739,1,i bought this for my  yr olds birthday he was so excited we turned it on and charged it up but it would not work the screen kept showing no card inserted i took it apart and doubled checked and the card was there and put in correctly i ended up sending it back super disappointed  yr olddidnt work
14089,5,this rice cooker is excellent it takes longer than you might expect so plan for that but the results are excellent white rice is fluffy and very similar to something bought from an indian takeout we have not tried all types of rice but the ones we have tried have all been very good clean up is so easy as well unlike our previous one which welded rice to the bottom of the panit does take longer to cook rice than you would expect
2433,2,i dont like writing a negative review about any products however as a semiexperienced photographer i was very disappointed in this camera i wanted a simple sortofpointandshoot camera for going on walks it is lightweight and compact however it is difficult to get a great picture due to the odd settings that randomly pop up i have yet to figure out how to get any distance shots which i knew would not be telephoto but this camera seems to have none the batteries charged quickly and held strong even when i left it in my cold car for a few days the instruction booklet was good but did not make sense adapting info to the camera in many areas sorry i would return it if i could i dont like writing negative reviews or returning products the price was inexpensive so i guess i learned my lessonnot so happy

1882,2,i only received  of the film packages the order says  receive all the film
6404,1,this camera is good if you want to film old found footage films the quality could be anything less of  i saw all these reviews on youtube and the quality was great so i thought id try it boy was i mislead it feels cheap its built cheap and its overall cheap if a camera is  and it says its  it most likely  is not  this was entirely my fault for being so naive and trusting the reviews that said it was good but i want to put this out there so other people know not to buy this the only reason im keeping it is because i actually like that it looks like a camera from the  i can use that instead of the vhs filter on my phone for found footage recordings but it will not ever compare to the gopro i mainly wanted it for underwater stuff but i guess thats going to change its now going to be used for making found footage films that looked like they were filmed in the  not a  camera not even close
8780,1,quality is low i would say so low not worth itgarbage

5900,1,very bad qualitypictures are very blurry waste of moneycamara
8795,1,the camera is cheap especially for the price every picture i have taken has come out dark and blurry it doesnt matter if you are inside with the lights on or outside in a sunny day the photos dont hold up either and fade super fast i thought this would be a fun thing to keep around the house to snap quick pictures with but its basically just a paperweight now because its not even fun to use i should has listened to other reviews and saved the moneynot even close to as good as the original
2236,2,i purchased this product in april to use for my trip in may a destination wedding i went to use this camera again the end of may and it would keep shutting off on me each time i powered it up the battery was fully charged i was also past the returnrefund period so i attempted to try the troubleshooting option no troubleshooting was able to help with this issue amazons help chat only sent me msg stating i was past the refund period so this was a total waste of

2498,1,worked great for like  weeks now wont recognize the filmstopped working after a month
6268,2,the camera shuts down after  minutes of filming due t overheatingnot a quality camera for the money you pay i expected more
6132,2,returnedtwo stars
9098,1,either the film is expired or is not stored well the images are foggy and came out dark in a full sun settingexpired film looks bad
8764,2,no matter how much light you have the pictures are too dark cannot take pictures at night flash doesnt work wellpictures are super dark
158,2,the camera is ok i was hoping for more most of the buttons dont work because its just a base camera the lens that came with the camera   has to be adjusted by hand manually if youre looking for a beginner camera their are other brands that wont set you back  bucks for basic videos and photosnot worth the price  bucks
7206,1,i trusted a multi thousand dollar camera to this strap only to have my camera fall hard to ground from my wrist during one of the first few wears upon inspection we found that the small strap see picture gradually slipped over itself and eventually came offit had one job and it failed
8419,2,for some reason this smells so strongly like cigarette smoke it burns my nosewhy does this smell like cigarettes
303,1,arrived with a big scratch on the lens camera itself works wonderful but the scratch ruins everythingdont get refurbished 
10460,5,bought on total impulse yesterday and arrived today made sesame chicken for dinner and cooked sticky jasmine rice in this thing it takes about  mins for the cycle and its seriously cooked to perfection i live alone with my picky  yr old who hates rice so this is perfectly sized for  or  ppl when my boyfriend comes over my only complaint is i wish the instructions were a hair more clear as ive never used a rice cooker before and it gives  kind of contradictory sets of instructions so glad i bought this though and its so small it takes up hardly any room on my apartment counter tops and bonus it matches my kitchenaid appliancesmust have
4924,1,the threads on the tripod mount broke after a few months of use do not recommendtripod mount broke
9684,4,i bought one for my boyfriends house because it is super easy to use and quick the only thing i dont like is when it is boiling sometimes the water will come up through the lid but that isnt much of a let down for methis is my second time buying it because i just loved it so much
7980,2,the product is easy to use but the quality of the pictures is really poor also the size of the pics is really smallbetter to avoid 
6755,2,definitely lower quality than the real vtech paper photos printed are much lower qualitylow quality
667,2,pics with my older samsung phone look so much better than with this cameraim definitely disappointedi should have bought a better n more expensive camerafor the money i guess its what it ispics dont look good in screen

4986,1,they both stop working not eating these productblurry pic it stop working the light just keeps blinking
8974,1,the flash doesnt work at allflash doesnt work
6400,1,i used this on my dirt bike ridding trails in colorado the camera seamed to work great but  into my trail ride i noticed the screen wasnt changing with the scenery it had locked up it required me to pull the battery to get it to reset this had been only a dirt gravel road so far i road some single track and it appeared to be keep working but my attention was the trail not the screen at the end of the trail the camera was locked up again maybe vibration i ride a ktm  i would have returned it but at some point during the rest of the next  of trail the handlebar mount broke and the camera was gone this camera may work for other uses but trail riding with it mounted to the handle bars did not work for meworks but
6702,1,the battery does not charge i will have to return itnot working
6300,1,this is false advertisement this is not  as described its barely  as advertised
8578,1,plugged in and the camera worked right away the image is nice for the price but only if you have good lighting in the dark there is a lot of noisethe ring light starts flashing out of nowhere and the only way to make it stop is by unplugging and plugging it again which is very inconvenient so thats a no no for me i had seen other comments with the same issue so its not an isolated case for  bucks more you can get a very nice camerait also came without the little tripod that it mentions itd come with i am returning itsave your money and buy something of more quality
9489,4,the black coating really smells and the first couple of times you use it burns off highly recommend putting into the dishwasher first then running water through a couple of cook cycles to get rid of the smellsmelly but its good for the money
3811,1,this camera was the biggest waste of money possibly ever i bought it as a gift for my  year old daughter because she wanted a pink camera and if i had realized the quality i would have returned it the moment we received it you can feel how lightfragile it is why does a camera come with two batteries proof of the quality in my opinion the photo quality is absolute trash theres no focus whatsoever the white balance is so off you can barely make out the photos and theres no way to change the settingsdont bother
2861,2,this camcorder is about  positive on a  scale why there is no manual focus is beyond me also the zoom functions at one speed with no way to zoom slow the video stutters when panning no matter how slow you pan add a smooth pan a manual focus ring and smooth zoom and you would have a great camcorder perhaps thats why it sells so inexpensivelyno manual focus and jittery video when panning no matter how slow the camera movement
5831,1,wouldnt work no matter how many memory cards i tried because it wont function without one and the camera menu format button required to set up the memory card is greyed out loads of blog rants over thiswhy is it still being sold also be careful not to buy christmas gifts the previous summeryour refund will be deniedangry fool
1472,1,terrible and all plasticjunk
858,1,purchased this for our daughters birthday the camera just flashes rapidly and ejects all the film without even pressing the shutter button tried replacing the batteries alternatives from what came with the camera and still no luckarrived defective
1784,2,only had it for a month or two before it stopped working was fun while it lasteddidnt last long
2457,1,do not spend your money on this just use your iphone could not rate any worse than this very badthis is awful very bad pictures
8975,1,i bought this camera on a deal from hsn and not even a month later i got a code on the screen and it turned off immediately i tried numerous times calling the company with one success to talk to an agentbut they referred me to a pdf to fill out i even sent an email back and it was ignored my saving grace was the extended warranty i had where i got most of my money back via allstate they are highly recommended and i didnt even have to return the camera within  days after callingi decided to save my money to get the iphone  pro since march  and i was also given an old canon rebel which worked finefor the time i had this camera working it did take nice pictures it was easy to use as well but i will take the time to research these cameras stick to more professional cameras like canon or use a working camera like that on the iphone pro modelsmy advice is to save your money and buy something better i gave this camera overall  star but i even regret thatdidnt even work for a month
1399,2,  quality is not true  the sound quality is poor on this camera  the image looks very   if youre going for a  vibe video then great other wise i wouldnt recommendnot that great

3904,2,i sent this packagebundle with accessories in cobalt blue mini  camera to my grandson for his  birthday the camera was fine but the carrying case and photo album arrived in pink amazon customer service wanted the entire gift returned which would have been difficult for the recipient eventually it was agreed upon that i order just the case and album in blue and then request a credit not my best amazon experience on a positive note he loves the camera and immediately went on a walk to take pictures of naturewrong accessory colors
2462,1,we bought this camera to take christmas pictures with our family the third picture i tried to take with this camera it froze and then the screen went green and i couldnt get it to turn off it wouldnt take any more pictures after that had to use a phone instead for family pics dont recommend at all we were super disappointed poor quality glitchy not dependable
14093,5,excellent product rice comes out perfect every single time and the stay warm function is the best to keep rice warm until its ready to eat i gifted one to my mom for christmas and she also loves itbest rice cooker
6303,2,at  you used to be able to get a real name brand canonsony point and shootpeople giving this  stars is crazy even as a kids camerahaving low expectations im not impressedthe dial is actually fake on this and just wasted spacedesignthe flip would have been more useful if you could angle it a certain way but it barely works as selfiehonestly youre better off getting a used real brand insteadcheap
10485,4,i cooked a half a cup of basmati with a half a cup of chicken broth a half a cup of water some frozen mixed veggies and a dollop of canola oil add a little garlic salt and onion powder and delicious perfect sized meal for one the rice cooker seems to take about  minutes i checked it at  and it wasnt quite done i checked it at  and it was starting to overcook on the bottom just beginning to brown and the cooker hadnt turned off it did as i was taking the rice out tho so keep an eye on it there is no beep or announcement or anything to tell you its donemmmmm basmati
3322,1,it sounds good on paper but i tried every setting in the camera and never got a good picture the picture quality is awful and the colors are not trueno matter what settings you usedont waste your money
8434,1,this camera stopped working the day it arrived first the cards kept getting stuck then the back would not close all the way and then the cards kept falling off finally it gave in altogether within the week we were traveling so we missed the return window but id like to return itdefective on day

1054,1,product totally bad cant retrieve pictures camara absolutely defected wrong to buy this camara and i cant return it  time expired took me a month to realized the camara was defectedtotally defected product
3198,1,purchase this product from amazon the first thing you need to do is trash the batteries it comes with after a couple days they corroded inside the auto flash after getting everything cleaned up was lucky to be able to save it after using remove batteries there is something that stays on in the drain the batterys dead every time i go to use it i have to install new batteries i would not recommend this productnot worth buying
9708,4,this is great so easy and convenient and makes perfect rice every single time i love being able to set and forget its small enough to not take up too much space and store easily my only complaint is the display screen doesnt read a countdown timer so you have no clue how long until the rice is done the screen just has a pacman chasing pattern as if thats useful perhaps i just havent figured out how to change itotherwise super easy cleanup and worth every penny 
7564,1,camera is cute and and my daughter loved it until she was playing back a video the sound is extremely quite and nothing can be heard even when sound is set to highestplayback sound sucks
9688,5,love my rice cooker i use it everyday and the rice comes out perfect each timea kitchen must
6944,2,i received this camera as a gift and was so excited after only a month the camera stopped working it wouldnt turn on i replaced the batteries multiple times eventually i got the camera to turn on and it would make the sound as if the lens was trying to open but it was stuck eventually i got the lens move but it only continued to get stuck i have zero luck trying to fix it the camera is great but definitely not meant to last very longnot going to last long

1,4,we have these next to the bed to charge our phones overnight that part works great however the green light to tell you that the phone is charging is so bright it lights up half of the room i put a piece of blue painters tape over the light and it is still so bright i could almost read by it electrical tape will be nextworks well but bright light
8045,2,this photo album was extremely small smaller than what you would thinksmaller than what you think
14757,5,ever since becoming obsessed with kdramas weve been trying out cooking different korean recipes wed see that looked good or just watched on youtube we learned a while back that not all rice is created equal and its pretty easy to screw up your rice that being said we decided to splurge and be totally lazy and get a rice cooker since buying this cooker we havent had bad rice since lol now we can enjoy delicious rice with our meats while we watch our fav shows the clean up is easy and super easy to workgreat cooker for great rice
7492,1,advertised on amazon in multiple places see below and attached on your advertising page for this camera is that it takes  mp photosit does not the highest resolution available on camera setup is only  mp provide me what you advertised and i thought i was paying fori will return this to you with prepaid shippingupgrade series of akaso  with  video recording capabilities as well as  videos and stunning  photos this action camera captures every moment with incredible detail and unparalleled claritynot as advertised only  photos not 
5883,1,i purchased this camera from my sons wish list i was there when he did the set up by the instructions he used it and took a picture of us the picture was grainy but nonetheless not bad for an automaticinstant camera a couple of days later he called me to tell me the camera had turned off and wouldnt turn back on he went online and saw reviews complaining of this as well the troubleshooting didnt work so we sent it back for a refundcamera turned off and wouldnt turn back on
3629,1,not worth it at all our first shipment was missing the photo album and the camera seemed used scratches always error signal and lens wouldnt fully open maybe it was previously dropped amazon gladly replaced it and the second shipment we received had everything in it but the camera rarely works it worked just fine the first few uses but then started showing the flashing error signal when trying to use and now we mostly get that error signal and weve only had this for about  months i would not recommend spending money on thisnot worth the money other reviews are accurate
5286,1,did not work very well at all went to a photoshoot and the whole camera froze one me many of times cost me my clientsdid not work very well at all went to 
14117,5,this rice cooker is perfect for making quick rice and or oatmeal i really like the size of the rice cooker doesnt take up too much countertop room tried it out for the first time and it worked greatperfect
680,2,honestly i should have known from the price that this wasnt anything spectacular i purchased it so that i could stop using my phone for vlogs but it turns out my phone has better camera quality than this  camera it takes a minute to focus in on things and the quality is bare minimum even a bit blurry at times i think im just going to have to suck it up and purchase the more expensive cameras if i want quality vlogs mediocre
7707,1,this camera is the worst camera i am so disappointed i bought this camera for my girls birthday present which she opened today i am very upset the quality of the camera is terrible it is cheap plastic junk the camera is made from very cheap light plastic that hardly weighs anything even when charged fully it struggles to turn on the icons when pushed dont work you cant look through the hole at the top it is very difficult to take photos you have to push the shutter button in for a long time and keep pushing it and it occasionally takes photos which are of very bad quality the whole camera is very hard to use and only occasionally works the functions themselves dont really work it is not worth even  dont buy itworst camera  dont buy
11099,5,use it minimum of once a week so easy my  year old can help me get dinner togetherlove it
608,1,this camera cracked within one day of use i placed it back into the case whenever i used it and the entire screen is completely brokenbroken camera
4805,1,requesting full refund or replacement purchased camera and boxes of film for christmas and it was all a waste worked fine for a few weeks then the batteries apparently died i have replaced them several times with several different brands and the camera will not work lights just keep flashing and nothing works i have researched online and apparently several models of these cameras have a power flaw  some issue where the usual brand name batteries wont work also all the boxes of film we purchased are all a waste really upset with this and now just left hoping i will be contacted and or refundedtotal junk do not buy
5029,2,pictures come out over exposed ive had older models and never had that issuecute

486,2,this camera lasted my neice  six months now it dies every time she puts it on movie mode buy new so you have a warrantydidnt last dont buy
4437,1,i hate it summs up my purchase returning this product within  week of buying it the menus within the frame are very difficult to navigate they are not logical perhaps a very technical person would have no problem but we are unable to use it i also find the instruction manual to be no helpcontacted customer service via their website and got instructions from them on deleting a video followed them exactly and still could not delete the video that was causing our machine to make a loud screech sound prior to playing and then locked up the entire photo frame so that it must be restarted the problem was the same no matter what videos we uploaded or how many we tried read the reviews well others had video problems toofor  we expect moreproduct has problems playing videos
11292,1,"this is a standard rice cooker and has a nonstick coated metal interior it is not ceramici had to use it for an event the day it arrived so its not eligible for a return however i ordered it expressly because the title of the product says ceramic this is a disappointing purchase "
0,4,i have bought several versions of these that havent worked im happy that they work my iphone jack has failed so these are the only means i have of charging my phone now theyre quite slow but better than nothingi wish the cord was longerabout the only flat chargers that have worked with my iphone
4065,2, positive very easy to set uplots of negatives read on and buyer  no local storage the camera comes with a base station that you plug in to power and hook up to your network it has no storage capability of its own even though storage is absurdly cheap these days but wait there are  usb ports on the back and a usb status light on the front and a help page explaining how to hook up a usb drive so you can have local storage backup only none of that actually works nowhere in those instructions or on the product page does it tell you that this feature only works on the pro base station even though all the hardware is there which doesnt make any sense  the pro base station looks completely  no audio yep thats right no audio detection recording or twoway at all again they never tell you this i the product  poor video quality first of all it can only do up to  and its very lossy and compressed even with night vision on which turns it black and white its not great  recording start lag because theres no local storage option and even if there is its a backup theres a large lag from the time the motion is detected to when the camera actually starts recording maybe this is because the motion detection setting is too low or because it needs to contact the server or base station to start streaming video but it loses several seconds of  only records  seconds by default i woke up and had several videos all of which caught a cat just leaving the scene or coming in and standing there this is due to the lag starting the recording and the  second recording limit making the camera virtually useless you have to search online to find a community post detailing how you have to log into the app go to the mode tab create a new mode and change the duration and even then youre only recording for a fixed time after recording starts its not smart enough to just keep recording as long as there is  paid subscription service arlo really wants you to use their servers to store you videos  there is no option for local storage only this causes lag and poor video quality and is a moneygrabbing scheme they do offer a free service level but id rather not have any service at all just local storagethe whole setup is a tiered pricing scheme  offer several pricing tiers to lure you into upgrading to their overpriced options to actually get a full set of features this is dishonest they do not mention the limitations in their marketing and poor business practice im returning mine right now as soon as i finish writing thiseasy to set up awful feature list
7538,1,my team tried everything in the settings and lighting options but sadly this product just is not what we can use in a professional recording setting the audio is unrecognizable in all cameras the quality of the visual recording was wasteful honestly i was stunned at how bad it was they have such a wide angle in the standard setting that you have to be holding the camera to be recognized in the shot they do not have a standard mount so you have to use the plastic water proof boxes they come in to record and they also have only up to about  hours of record time due to the card availability according to the manualif you want them as outdoor cameras for walking in the woods to let your kids have some fun before they get something worth spending money on this might be for you but do not buy them for a professional recording devicenot a professional product
6293,1,i do not even know where to start just look at the image of a product costing more than  eur and on top of what you seen the passport does not open properly i am returning this article immediately

8864,2,the camera auto focus leaves much to be desired and manual focus is not fine enough to get a clear picture i will be returning this camerareturning
9490,4,"this is a good basic rice cooker rice comes out fine my beef is the design and safetyas best i can figure it has a dual temperature thermostat when you set to cook it heats until enough water is cooked off that the temperature goes up beyond the high set point at which it switches to the keep warm temperature set point it stays there until you unplug the cookeri dont consider this safe it would have cost an extra maybe  in manufacturing to either put in a manual onoff switch or a timed cutoff for the warm cycle frankly im surprised cpsc hasnt shut this model downwheres the off switch"
7263,2,look up hero  focus issue my recently purchased camera had the focal length set to about  feet ultra closeups were crisp and clear but anything at a distance of more than  feet was blurry making it unusable for my intended purpose of a bike helmet camera to capture traffic and road conditions unknown if this is an intentional feature or a defect but be wary i returned mine and my sony  is on its way to me as we speakpoor focus at long range returned
847,1,my daughter elena wanted this since last year as her bd gift i got it for her and most of the photos she takes are blanks i have no idea whether this is an issue of photo card that came along or the cam itself other than the waste of money time and efforts the disappointment this has caused to her is very significant she is really sad she waited nearly  months for her birthday to come she was very excited and happy suddenly this happens worst enough most of the photos where from birthday party tooregretting every moment of disappointment this caused to my  daughter
2083,1,this says it comes with  instax mini as the bundle it only comes with twoi purchased this bundle for the extra film it came with leaving out the extra  makes a huge difference and would not otherwise purchased this bundlei expect to receive compensation for missing film otherwise returning the bundle for a different onebundle not as advertised
4347,2,loved this pack when i first got it but within a week the thread holding the main strap and the secondary strap started falling apart and the tripod portion does not fit my tripodwhat a let down
334,1,didnt even get the chance to use this because it literally came broken it didnt work at all tried charging and all the troubleshooting tasks that i could find nothing worked not worth it if i could give zero stars i wouldwish i could give zero stars
5302,2,one of the lenses came damagedtwo stars
3312,2,the camera works but hard to set or view your pictures the buttons on the camera are much too small also hard to focus i guess you get what you pay forthe control buttons are much to small for normal fingers to push
7413,1,wanted this for a party to capture guests but picture quality extremely poor would not recommend purchasing very disappointed missed opportunity to capture good photos of guestsextremely poor picture quality

17349,5,short if you are on the fence put this on your list and the moment the price drops close your eyes and hit buy now long i agonized for months about buying this through marriage i gained  husband who prefers rice with every meal and  rice cooker that glues rice to the bowl so after months of agony research pandemic i went crazy and bought this i came from a family with no prior rice or rice cooker experience after research i was determined to get a zojirushi or cuckoo but this model went on sale it has the induction bowl and a million settings i mostly cook jasmine rice which it makes perfectly on the jasmine and quick rice settings the rice lasts for  days maybe longer but will start to dry i think ive gotten to be more obsessed with rice than my husband after this the main thing is i can barely rinse this and it comes clean i dont have to use any elbow grease zero effort in fact i intentionally use as little effort as possible to preserve the bowl ive had the rice cooker for over  months i was sick about the price and swore if i didnt love it it was going back now i keep trying to convince my family and friends to buy one lol i have also made sticky rice and i bought gaba to test i will update my review if it dies or does anything uncool since it costs a fortune happy rice makingperfection
9286,5,this small rice cooker size is good enough to cook for two people and its easy to use i use this to cook rice when there only me and my sister are home and it is easy to clean after we are finished using it  the price is also reasonable and worth it high recommendedrice cooker
3379,1,never worked cheap madedont buy
7074,1,poor quality on the photos felt like it was definately not worth the cost youd be better off using and oldschool polaroid vs this thingquality does not match photos
1444,1,i hated this thing a surprising amount but i paid  so i got what i paid for i guessit was awful but i got what i paid for
7761,2,granddaughter loved it but took poor picturespoor pictures
7585,2,liked price components came with it swivel headdisliked the gels warped with the heat of the light hotter than expected and no longer fitted in the small handles they are suppose to slide in very inconvenient as i had to tape them on but because of the warps white light leaks out from the sides gels provide just a slight color hue not really a rich color the stand is too light and knocks over super easy separate weights needed not a huge deal but slightly inconvenient usb endregretful buy considering how many options are out there
619,1,not sure who would want this camera any modern phone has a far better camera i bought this to use as a pocket travel camera for snapshots to maybe print later but the photo quality is so bad im not even bothering to take it on my trip because i honestly dont think any picture taken would make a decent print i realize this camera sells for cheap but id think a camera advertising  could should be at least print worthyi wish i hadnt destroyed the packaging so i could return itnot worth it
8969,1,after  months of use this item broke ripoffdont waste your money
3711,2,used  times and the battery stopped working dead battery
1508,1,i bought this camera and a new sd card to go with it once the sd card was inserted the camera still showed that no sd card was available i was using a brand new out of the packet  sd card and also tried another sd card but the camera still would not read it the sd card holder could not read the cards so i simply had to throw the brand new camera away before even taking a photo on it 
3693,2,you need to buy a cord to plug this in it is unique to vitrox wants they  for this the battery doesnt hold a charge very long and frequently dies in the middle of web conference the charger is made very poorly and i dont believe it will last long i dont recommend i plan on returning thisnot impressed
6402,1,this was purchased for a star gazer and he is absolutely in love with the fact that he has a camera to take pictures with except the minor detail of the sd card when you put the card in it goes straight thru no stopping it now we have a camera that is holding  cards on the insidestar gazer

4121,2,at first i was thrilled with this product its well made easy to set up and worked immediately but i then tried to use their software on my computer i spent all afternoon trying to figure it out used google to find help and discussions and finally had the sensitivity and picture capture set where i thought it might worknext day i looked for captures of deer on our porch there was nothing but a  am capture when my wife went to check i googled again and found that the factory schedule is set to  am to  pm pretty much the opposite of whats logical i then looked for a schedule setting screen nothing i googled more and all i found was instructions about a selection that wasnt there i then tried a different browser and sure enough there was the selectionproblem solved no i tried to set  pm to  am and got red xs it wouldnt save i ended up with two on times  pm to i hope  am then  am to  am theres apparently a gap from  am to  am that cant be set with this screen see screenscrape  theres no scroll down thats it screenscrape  shows my attempt to set the schedule i want note it wont save greyed outin addition theres no help or contact i had to google for everything theres almost no documentation supplied the user manual has to be downloaded then its mostly useless since the buttons werent showing in my browser the schedule is confusing i still dont know if i have everything correctmy wifes already saying its a waste of money i would have given  star but its nicely made and basically workssoftware interface screens are absurd
6091,1,wanted to have cameras at our wedding to take pictures for our guest book and take home photos these cameras did a great job at taking absolutely not one picture at all sat there changing batteries and still nothing the amount of relief it was returning these cameras was beyond amazing weight lifted off my shoulders do not waist your time or money take your money elsewhere for a product that will actually workabsolutely not what you need
160,1,the color isnt too bad but the dpi is   and therefore pretty horrible pictures and unable to make decent prints i do urban wildlife photography and this camera seems a lot worse than my iphonese forget taking pictures of wildlife or animals with this camera youd have to be right up in their faces the catapillar thing took several minutes to focus enough to take also it wouldnt let me change iso and the screen never showed me what i was taking a picture of you have to use viewfinder this camera feels mid  in quality and overly complicated to use for being an incredibly low quality camera im going to have to go with a nikon again very dissapointeddpi is 
5357,2,purchased at the end of december for the holidays i used it maybe three times total i took it out recently in may for graduation and it stop working i googled and you tube ways to repair and nothing worked do not buycamera didnt last  mths
2363,2,this camera has been awesome to have around the house and create memories but after  weeks it stopped working the first thing you do notice is that it is a pretty cheap fun camera and then you realize that is exactly what you get a cheap fun camera after just a few weeks of use it stopped taking pictures and the light just blinks rapidly when you try to take a picture despite a lot of research the main reasons come down to batteries are out and film is suck after replacing batteries and film wasting several packs in the process it still just simply doesnt work anymore so i hope you enjoy this camera but i cant recommend that it will work beyond a few uses we loaded up on film for a party and it lasted two pictures before it died i would suggest going another route for an instant camerathis camera is awesome when it works
8395,2,this was easy to set up and use however the quality of the pictures was not great i had to make the image as light as possible even though the photo looked fine the printed version was dark with blue tint probably wont use very often and its too late to return it not at all what i was expecting
1154,1,literally was the quality of  videos not  at all do not buynot 
14748,5,"my old cuckoo rice cooker finally died it was literally  years old so i had to buy another onethis one seemed the most like my old one same basic size pot same heavy metal same thick enamelone thing the new one does not do it does not have a korean girl randomly scream at me when various timers where reached on the  years and i never did figure out what the heck she was yelling at mebut i kind of miss it on the new onei love these things"
2216,2,the lighting is very fluorescent and isnt good for pictures the placement of lights is uneven which makes for dark spots and the lights arent even bright enough in the first place it works in a pinch and pictures can be edited but you can still see the difference in quality in picturesbad lighting
6312,1,printer did not work might as well buy a regular cameraprinter did not work
4678,1,the usb card reader does not read the micro sd slot anymore for the longest time i thought it was the micro sd but turned out it was this card reader i must have gotten a lemon since most reviews are positivethis product failed after  months
2149,1,i was very happy with this product  being able to photograph my art work so easily but after  months of use the light suddenly stopped working amazon prime gave me a  refund because i am a good customer even though the warranty had run out but i still cannot use this useless box now and have to figure out how to dispose of it im so disappointed because it really worked great i tried to search for replacement lights but none to be found i would expect something like this to last more than  monthslight failed to work after  months of use
4754,2,the product is very small its not as big as i thought it was gone be but it does work very good i do recommend this for a camera vlogingits very small
9326,4,i was excited to try this out the night it arrived as a trial i put in  cup of rice and  cup of water per the directions after it switched from cooling to keep warm i opened the lid to find some of the rice was slightly burnt in one of the attached photos ive marked where this cooker appears to have a hot spot thats likely to burn the rice it could be this cooker will perform better with a larger amount of rice or perhaps i simply need to add more water in the future and maybe a little oil overall im still pleased as it cooks quickly and the nonburnt rice met my expectations i think i need to experiment a bit more to refine the process  star instead of  star for nowmight not do well with smaller quantities
3869,1,this camera is truly a waste of money my phone sadly takes far better photos than this camera and is significantly easier and faster to use i am genuinely disappointed the preview shows a clear bright picture but the video or photo that is actually recorded is several stops darker than the preview several stops not a little darker several stops darker in  years of video and photo work i have never seen a camera perform so poorly nor a preview so inaccurate to the actual recording run far away from panasonic lumix cameras if you want your preview to match the actual recorded imagethis is hands down the very worst camera i have ever used
2446,1,sd card wouldnt stay in shot across the room several times on my sliced hundreds of picturesgarbage
17323,5,"i have owned and used this for the past  months consistently it is the best most capable easiest to use useful rice cooker i have ever owned and it is not even close i typically make  cups at a time but have made as little as  cup and as much as  cups my favorite setting is the sushi rice setting as it is my favorite texture but have tired most of the other settings if rice is a regular part of your diet this is a must purchasepros best keep warm feature yes it has an extended keep warm feature but the regular keep warm feature will keep the quality for a solid  days with no degradation of quality and the rice is still better than any reheated rice on day  the extended keep warm can theoretically keep it warm for even longer but why more useful and easier to integrate into your life the ease of use and perfect keep warm features mean that you can start a pot of rice in the morning and have it ready for dinner in the evening or whenever the excellent keep warm and highest finished quality is a real game changer for meal prep perfectly cooked rice every single time from the grain on the top of the pot to the grain on the pot of the pot each is perfectly cooked and you have full control of what perfect means so if you like soft rice then choose that if you like firm rice then choose harder or sushi the quality of the finished rice is superior to every rice cooker i have ever had or tried and better than the vast majority from a pot or restaurant the quick rice setting is excellent it is pretty fast at  minutes and has very good quality the standard setting is  and the quick rice setting is still at  the gaba brown rice is a great feature gaba brown rice makes brown rice even healthier and far more digestible it tastes great and has a lot more of a regular rice texture i highly recommend trying it very easy to clean quick wipe out with soapy water and wipe dry and you are good i have left cooked rice in it for  weeks on the keep warm setting and it cleaned out easily still a little more scrubbing but no problem still previous rice cookers i have had use a cheap aluminum pot but this is a very solid stainless steel with an excellent non stick coating excellent materials stainless steel pot and lid are heavy duty and are not going to warp or breakdown like a cheap rice cooker will induction heating gives incredibly even cook which makes a big difference to the finished rice and easy to clean nature i can easily see this appliance being a workhorse for my family for  years easily perfect size for my family i could make  cups of cooked rice which is enough to feed a good size group or a small amount which is enough for me and my two kids if you need more capacity then get the bigger brother which can cook  cups which is a lot of rice the song it serenades you with a little twinkle twinkle as you start a pot of ricecons price yes it is  times the cost of other rice cookers but you get what you pay for so save up and maybe eat out a little less then buy this ultimately it is worth the price since it will last  times a long as others and give you  times better rice consistently lesser rice cookers scorch the bottom and undercook the top so you will waste less of the finished product dedicated appliance this is a dedicated rice cooker it is not an instapot or slow cooker but it does what it does perfectly it does take up space to have another appliance on the counter but consider having it on directly on the tablefinal verdictif you eat rice on the regular this is a must buy for me i recommend it to my friends and family so yeah i would recommend saving up and buying itbest kitchen appliance"
7892,2,i think this product works well for what i needed it for how ever ive been using this for a few weeks and im lucky if i even get  pictures to print before the battery is dead i feel like i am constantly charging itdoes not hold a charge
9080,1,i bought two boxes of color itype film for a brand new polaroid now i stored the film in a refrigerator and let it warm up to room temperature before loading it as suggested almost all of my photos had a semicircular undeveloped patch with white veins radiating from it i cleaned my rollers repeatedly in case it was an issue with my camera but nothing changedwith the second box i was able to take about  photos per pack before the film stopped ejecting i brought the camera to a full charge cleaned the rollers and checked for debris i reinserted the film several times to no avail this might be a problem with my camera but the film that did eject had that same undeveloped patchthe film wasnt expired though yayfilm flaws
13764,4,this works great for a mini rice maker the rice cooks evenly the downsides the manufacturer recommends washing the rice in different bowl to reduce risk of damage to the cooking pot it doesnt really have a useful warming function the major downside is that if you have any challenges with your vision like the need for reading glasses it is tough to see the numbers and fill lines on the cooking pot as they blend right in to the color of the pot this is really the only inconvenience that matters to meits a decent rice maker
5349,1,returned this the photos were bad but mainly the batteries had to be changed constantlyhave to use regular batteries not rechargeable
1136,2,you get what you pay for herealright at best get what you pay for
6083,1,the first camera that was purchased was broken and i unfortunately used two packs of film to try to get it to work the photos came out black i opted to replace the camera and the second camera from the seller was stuck in selfie mode and wouldnt work otherwise and i wasted another pack of film i ended up requesting a refund and would not recommendbroken camera
2448,1,this camera isnt very good dont waste your money i bought it to early for my baby shower to use so now i cant return it the pictures all showed up blurry i thought maybe it was the user but i cant even get a good picture from itdont waste ur money
917,1,over all not bad but it does not come with an external battery charger i shot photos and videos that were not to bad good enough for what i what i wanted but when i went to recharge the battery not so i had this on charge for over  hours and did not charge it up for even  minutes of use then i recharged it for another  hrs and still the same out comegoing to return for a replacement and see what happens might not get it before i leave on vacationwhich is not okhwsthis does not have an external battery charger
6739,2,i bought this bag in black and beige expecting to really love them but i returned both the material was not what i expected for an everyday kind of bag it looked like it was going to get easily dirty and just felt cheap the inserts always moved around causing me to almost drop a lens when removing the camera i really dont understand the hype or the price point i ended up buying a camera bag from a random brand i just opened it and it definitely feels much better than brevite and it was only  inserts are sturdy the compartment separator is actually zippered comfyi dont understand the hype
6619,2,very cheap feelingcheap
7381,1,the eyepiece is way too small when u try to adjust it it flops all apart u cant use it while in a seated positionpoorly made
1772,2,proseasy to usecheap but nice quality film easily availableaffordablelightweight easy to store and carrycomfortable in hand once you get used to how to hold itlittle selfie mirror on front is usefulvery cute and aestheticcons poor picture quality pictures come out blurry unless you have the perfect conditionscant turn onoff flash always onflash is is too bright up close but not bright enough to reach very far no further than a few feetfocus isnt great even in good lighting and it cannot be manually controlledcannot take pictures when its dim or in the dark wont come out at all or will be extremely blurryyou have to aim slightly to the right for the picture to be centered i dont even know what would cause thislens doesnt pop out correctly when turned on it gets stuck you have to manually pull it out or the lens wont open wasted a lot of film not realizing it wasnt open since you see through a little window and not the actual lensdespite the seemingly massive amount of cons vs pros i still plan on keeping and using the camera as it does fit my very basic needs i wouldnt recommend it for anyone looking for any kind of quality or versatility thoughwish i could give it more stars but
1028,1,i hit this on my steering wheel and bam no more working camera cheap plastic camera with no toughness and they say this is a good kids camera i have had it barely a monthdont knock or hit it
5017,1,this was sent in a box lined with plastic grocery bags it came used all of it was used and items missing from the kit toocame used
1122,1,do not let these reviews fool you this camera is something out of  with the resolution buttons and quality i opened the box and now sending back immediatelyyou get what you pay for
2340,1,while fun to use at first it stopped working after only  days after the first charge my daughter  years old was very disappointed such a ripoff she saidstopped working after only  days
5573,1,i havent even used the camera yet but instead of  boxes of film sheets i got two rip offdid not get all of the film i ordered
9284,5,i like this product i use it mainly too cook rice and make bread but it can also be used to steam food slow cook and many more it is very easy to move around and can be kept in small cabinets because of how small and cute it is the inside is very clean and efficient its made from stainless steel and extremely durablecute and easy to carry
7200,1,this camera strap is super comfy but unfortunately it unsnapped during the first day of usetheres no failsafe if the wrist strap unsnaps while you arent securely holding your camera body like my partner wasnt while opening his yeti water bottle it will send your camera tumbling we cant afford to drop an  ii with  lens so were returning thiswrist strap unsnapped on day 
13102,4,while cooking sperts out a lot of waterleaks
8902,2,still learning about how to maximize the use of the camera but it seems to be a great value camera for the costupdate  i am still learning because i am a guy and you all know that guys dont follow instructions lol seriously although i am still in the process of learning about all this camera can do i am very much pleased with it one of these days i will learn about all the camera can do in the meantime i have to tell you that the camera takes great pictures great valuegreat value
14864,5,its very lightweight and easy to carry also easy to use i love the color just matches with my friends new apta gift for my friend
4912,1,terible underwater camera bot worth a pennydont buy
4441,1,i have one  inch frame which works well i bought a second one to use at my other house and wanted to transfer all of the pictures from one frame to another impossible to do there is no phone support to help you only email and it is in france i have had to select  photos at a time and download them then go back and unselect them since there is a maximum of  at a time very backward i was going to buy a number of other ones for the family but not after the hell they have put me throughthey told me i could download  at a time into an album but an album has a max of  and i already have  pictures in my first onefrustrating
10492,5,this device is perfect if you are living alone and need to make portions of stuff for one i have used it for rice oatmeal pancakes and heating up corn from a can for rice nishiki you need to use about  water vs rice    cups to get the right consistency this is higher than the water ratio in my much bigger rice cooker despite that it cooks in less than  mins vs my larger rice cooker  mins so besides time this is also an energy saving i botched the oatmeal prep the first time the milk overflowed out of the cooker creating a mess tasted fine but sure i can get it to work i was more surprised that this made a perfect thick pancake from combination regular and buckwheat mix in one shot  about  mins per pancake you dont need to cook it twice like in the manual lastly used it as a no muss no fuss solution to heat up some canned corn straight out of the can worked great the one thing i wish is it would ring a little bell to let you know when its done you have to keep checking the light also no onoff switch but that seems to be standard for lowcost appliances these days these are small quibbles though great productgreat little device versatile
2491,1,not good photo pics not good at allbad
17315,4,"i purchased a zojirushi  neuro fuzzy rice cooker  a couple of years ago and i loved it the fuzzy logic rice cooker employs technology that is at least  years old based on my research rice connoisseurs told me that the induction models are best and most up to date technology so i took the plunge and bought this model i have used it perhaps  times now and am ready to give my impressionsthis model has a dedicated jasmine rice setting and i have cooked a good quality jasmine rice three ladies in it twice now and it makes fantastic jasmine rice mind you if you use a low quality jasmine rice do not expect to get the same results good quality rice  a high quality rice cooker is what produces excellent ricei have also prepared my favourite high quality japanese sushi rice in it oddly enough i did not think the sushi rice turned out as well in this machine as it did in the fuzzy logic machine but as i said i have only prepared it once and i may have made an error in measuring the water or something so i want to prepare another batch of sushi rice in this machine before i come to any conclusionsi have not used any of the other settings so far so i cannot comment on them at this time but i hope to try the other settings relatively soon and i hope they will be what makes this model worth the hefty price tagthe bowl and the removable inner lid on this machine is of a higher quality than those on the fuzzy logic model and i like that a lot the outside of this unit however seems to be nothing more than stainless steal coloured plastic which i do not like in fact this machine has a lot of plastic on it and i dislike this fact very much for this price they could use real stainless steel and a heck of a lot less plastictwo other negatives to this machine are that it has no reheat function and its cord is neither removable nor retractable for storage i would prefer a removable cord that could be placed in a drawer whilst not in use personally i do not like retractable cords the retractable cord on my fuzzy logic model stopped working smoothly after a month or so in my opinion removable cords are bestthe upshot is that so far i am pleased with the much higher quality bowl and higher quality removable lid but i am disappointed in the amount of plastic used in this model given its price point i like that this rice cooker has a dedicated jasmine rice setting and i look forward to trying the gaba rice setting i have never had gaba brown rice before so that will be something of a gastronomic adventure for me i hope i love the gaba brown rice because i paid a lot more for this rice cooker because it is includedhowever my advice to other buyers is if neither a dedicated jasmine rice setting nor a gaba brown rice setting is important to you and you really like having a reheat function then opt for the fuzzy logic modelyou can get excellent quality rice from the fuzzy logic model for a considerably lower cost and the fuzzy logic model comes with a retractable cord too it is also a little smaller unit than this induction model and thus takes up less countertop and cupboard space i highly recommend the fuzzy logic model with these qualificationsat the moment i guess i likely will keep this rice cooker unless i try the gaba brown rice setting and find i do not like gaba brown rice well enough to eat it regularly or unless my sushi rice continues to come out just soso because i eat more sushi rice than any other type and the fuzzy logic model makes great sushi rice porridge etcmy recommendations for improving this model are to make it with a detachable cord and a reheat function if it had those two features i would love this rice cooker not having these two features really dampens my enthusiasm for this induction model at this price pointsecond zojirushi first induction model"
8538,1,brought this camera as a christmas present for my wife only used it a couple of times and now it want load film and makes a sound like the advance mechanism is trying to load the film this is a very disappointing purchase my wife really like the camera and now it does not work very sad bad experience according to the reviews other buyers have had the same issue fuji should have a resolution for this issue and not charge the purchaser any cost in rectifying it amazon should also make good on this purchase very disappointedonly used it a couple of times and now it want load film and makes a sound like the advance mechanism is trying to load the film
3794,1,bought this to put photos on my web site have not been able to get a single usable image i am experienced with cameras from point and shoot to slr and digitalslr so not because of lack of experienceterrible picture quality
696,2,they had it marked down as if i were getting a deal on a really good camera and it was only a deception the camera was not good at allfake price cut
5300,1,dont buy this product there should be design faults with this camera the colour temperature of each shots from this camera is in my opinion worse that any lowcost automatic digital cameral on the market i have asked for return and refund but refused by the seller beware i feel being cheated amazoncom should have ensured that each product on their shelf should perform at least to the expectation of an ordinary persondont buy this producti feel being cheated
7594,1,the gimble has a ball head that was too loose to hold the light upright and there was no way to tighten it factory defect that renders the whole light system useless the light just flops downward to face the floor returningpoorly manufactured bad quality control
2856,1,the camera is not easy to usecheap
4888,2,you cant activate macro mode or change the flash settings when in auto mode so you have to go to manual or program mode but neither of these modes save your settings when you turn the camera off so every time i turn the camera on i have to get set all of my settings again every time you delete the photos from the camera roll it resets the numbering sequence so when you move pictures to your computer youre presented with the overwrite menu every single time this is just a pain but im more worried about hitting the wrong button and overwriting a whole bunch of pictures by accident the auto flash mode flashes on shiny objects every single time despite the amount of ambient light it doesnt matter how bright or dark it is if the camera flashes on a shiny object its gonna be over exposed the opposite happens when im in a dark environment in a dark room it refuses to flash it always uses the long exposure mode that does nothing to brighten the picture and is impossible to hold the camera perfectly still for that long so always comes out blurry so im am constantly having to turn flash on and off i bought two of these at the same time both are like this i should have spent a little more money and bought the nikons will not purchase kodak againabsolute pain in the ass
9241,1,this camera was fun for the first couple of months we needed to charge it plugged it in and it wont hold a charge it wont work total trash i would not recommend buying from this company as it states that the product support and return window are closedit wont charge useless
16966,5,"replaced my  cup aroma rice cooker with this carb reducing rice cooker because it claims to help get rid of the extra starches in rice with traditional rice cookers i can always see white film of starch cooked into my rice and caked on the lid i love rice but always thought about how i was also eating these extra trace carbs with it now i feel guilt free eating my rice let me start off by saying the finished product tastes so healthy and clean the starch does indeed separated and drain down it has a pure clean taste to it unlike anything ive tasted before which was always slightly sweet with all the starch residues this rice has consistently come out even visually clean with not a spec of the white starch film residue of a traditional rice cooker its not even on the lidthe process of making it took me  trial times to get it right and not mushy dont follow their directions on the water ratio when using the carb reducing stainless steel basket it came out mushy way too much water i found after putting in my rice i just put enough water to cover it no more than half an inch on top of the rice the less the better hope this helps you can experiment but dont give up if the first results dont work out youll find what works best for you and then youll consistently make great rice like i dovery easy to clean another note if that although it is beautiful and modern looking it is bigger than i thought it would be but its ok i got used to it bc of the benefits of what it does with the carb technology and its more than a rice cooker i steam alot with it as well with its large capacity steam basketcarb reducing feature works"
4244,1,wont even turn on day  not turn on
6422,1,product itself is good the company however suck i purchased this back in july of  here it is now  feb i had a defective camera sent me a new one cool well i sent it back an the day they never received it so a half a year they charge my card would not buy from this company everthe company that sells the product

2107,1,this made a great christmas gift for my  year old but it just stopped working within a couple of months and my email to the seller about it remains unanswered so now im left with an expensive polaroid camera that doesnt work and plenty of extra film and parts to go with it that cant be usedstopped working within a couple of months and no reply to my email
4575,2,ordered the camera bundle that shouldve come with a bunch of accessories received only the camera no film no case no frames no stickers none of the additional accessories came the camera looks used there are scuffs and scratches all over does not look like an authentic instax item box wasnt even sealed this was supposed to be my daughters birthday present i am so disappointedmissing all accessories
1124,1,this camera claims to shoot in  at  fps it shoots in  but the fps is only  i tried to figure out if there was a way to change this feature there is not the videos look terrible the auto focus only works when it is in camera mode it wont focus at all while shooting videos overall bad video quality pictures are a little better because they do focus but theyre also not great the software on the camera feels like im using a  camcorder like the kind you should have put a little vhs tape in i will be returning this it just cant do what i want at all not sure who could be satisfied with a camera of this low quality might as well downgrade to my old blackberry from  camera description is simply inaccurate
4904,1,no technical support kodak has moved on also my phone takes better pictureswifi and software for transferring photos to phone or laptop is outdated and does not work

8292,1,i bought this for my daughter for valentines day shes  i charged it the day before took a picture to test it and it was great gave it to my daughter and she took two pictures one of me and one of my wife and it froze with my stupid face on the screen and absolutely nothing works to make it turn off or reset nothing stupid waste of money and an upset  year old on valentines daydont buy
8046,1,easily bends and wrinkles when inserting pictures in slots plastic bends and wrinkles  worth it
5522,2,this camera worked fine for the first  months i had it then it started doing weird stuff i sent it back to panasonic and since i got it back it has given me problems ive had someone more expert than myself trying to get it working right and we finally decided the camera is in worse shape than before it was fixednow the front dial is not functioning i cant shoot one shot at a time the burst shots are blurry and photos are grainy the only setting i can use with any success is c i am very disappointed as i loved my  and wanted raw capabilities and a longer zoomstopped functioning well after  months got fixed and no longer works
8957,1,very disappointed the app link  plus has started crashing i was able to use it before with no issuescant download my pictures now too late to return itemdont buy it only offer one app and it keeps crashing
14865,5,and in perfect conditioni havent used this yet but it did arrive on time
3824,1,i got this camera to have better quality photos than my phone but this thing takes the most blurry lowquality images i checked the settings and confirmed that this was just the resolution of the camera my fault for thinking anything less than a couple hundred dollars would be anywhere near decentwould be alright for a present to a kid or someone who otherwise has no access to cameras but it definitely didnt meet my expectationsterrible quality
4582,1,tldr i received only the camera two times after contacting customer support to tell them about their mistake the  timelibger version i ordered this bundle to give someone as a present obviously chose it bc of the items that made the gift extraspecial when it arrived just the camera was in the package not a big deal  contacted them they said they would ship a new package out and i just had to return the first package within  days great except nopethe second package also has only the camerai understand mistakesmixups happen but this is frustrating because i am running out of time for her birthday and i have to return both cameras while also taking a chance by ordering the package againim your cautionary tale dont order this youll waste money and timesent without any accessories twice
14254,5,i was tired of boiling rice over on the stove and the microwave rice took several bags at a time for our needs this thing was a terrific find perfect rice every time so far i start it before sauteing veggies and cooking the meat and by the time i have those done the rice is good to go  minutes sometimes ill even start it as soon as i come in and then let it sit until i need it because it does have the warming function on it ive never had a rice cooker before but glad i have one noweasy
3587,1,the camera bricked itself during its out of box firmware update it wont do anything except show an update screen buy something elsegarbage software ruins an otherwise nice camera
1406,2,returned it photo quality was horrible wanted something to zoom in better without photo looking fuzzy well this one isnt it photos came out horrible without even zooming in not to mention how cheap and light weight it felt the lens was more like the cheap clip on ones you get for cellphones just larger sized should didnt seem like a  megapixel seems more like a  if your luckynot happy with this one
885,2,i bought this a year ago for students to use for projects the camera quality is fine but not great at all and the microphone barely does anything i wish i hadnt spent the money on thisnot really worth it
12301,5,"we already had the zojirushi water boiler and it is probably  years old with that in mind when we were looking for a rice maker we decided on zojirushinot only does this look lovely on the counter top it works incredibly wellthe first thing we made was brown rice easy use cup which is very kindly provided and level fill with the rice you want to use add water to clearly marked corresponding line in the rice maker select menu select the type of rice you are using press start enjoy nicely cooked ricewe baked cheesecake which is deliciousi made my husband a birthday cake and he said it was the nicest sponge cake he had tasted  i added lavender and vanillathe perfect omelette mix eggs add a little milk and any additions cheese onion carrot etci read in a recipe online that you cook it for  minutes i set the rice maker for quick which shows  minutes i was in a hurry and just set the timer on the microwave for  minutes well the microwave timer went off and i looked at the rice makerwell wouldnt you know it the timer had adjusted and was just about to go off the omelette was perfectly shaped and just flopped out onto the plate when i inverted the inner pan of the rice maker that night i just had to make my husband an omelette well it was more of a fritatta as he wanted some leftover rice in it quick easy and delicious mealwe have used the timer program for oatmeal we had guests who needed to be up very early so we set it for oatmeal and when they got up the oatmeal was done to perfectionwe put water up to the  cup mark then fill the steamer basket with eggs and press quick pefectly hard boiled eggswe experimented and put  cups of water and one cup of beer in it and bratwursts in the steamer basket quick programand the brats are fabulous this is the way we cook them nowwith care i hope it lasts as long as our zojirushi water boilerupdatehave cooked chicken curry in it pasta and meatballs and a number of dishesnot just rice but cheesecake sponge cake boiled eggs bratwurst and omelettes chicken curry and pasta and meatballs"
6289,2,this will have to go back  no matter what i try to open it its just so stiff and im afraid i will break it this feels cheap to be honest and i just know it will break if i force it anymorewill try another one but this is so poor 
7362,1,the stand cant support the weight of the mirror head and keeps falling over you have to hold it to stabilize the equipment then looking into the mirror you can only see a very small section of the painting you are desiring to drawonly good for small pictures
5806,2,camera has no internal memory so memory card is a must replacement charger for battery is no longer available battery has to be removed from camera in order to charge wifi instruction are for windows  and the steps go on forever if you intend to use for wildlife forget it because focus takes forever and keeps searching i would not buy this againold model
2085,1,camera doesnt work tried the troubleshooting directions and still didnt work unfortunately i wasnt able to get it returned in timecamera doesnt work
8158,2,updated  so now almost  years with this camera and it has been a lovehate relationship from random start up and shut down to not connecting to phone not powering on lets not even discuss the lack of support and how many days it takes to get a simple answer there are no simple answers and now the camera is dead the internal battery has swollen up to the point that the housing has crackedi love how small this camera is and how long the battery life is i dont like that this is built backwards if you ride and put this on the left side of your helmet so you keep your hand on the throttle and handbrake the controls are upside down also there is no image stabilizer i mounted this on my fairing on my harley the video looked like the camera was having a seizure every bump was clear and the engine vibrations carried up thru the videonow i just use this as a dash camera in my truck and not what i purchased it for which was to document my road trips on my bikejust ok not as good as expected much much room for improvements
2002,1,have taken about  pictures with this and havent had a single one in focus i thought maybe it was because i sucked at taking photos so i gave it to someone i know takes polaroids as well and they couldnt get it to work either maybe i just got a faulty onefocus doesnt work
7765,1,i had to replace the first  because screen kept a bright light could not take pictures then received the  one and its pretty much the same screen messed up will be returning product soonthe worse
4654,1,drive was not at all compatible with mac os as stated in the listing when plugged into a pc file had hundreds of files in a foreign language total junk and corruptedcorrupted junk
6448,1,this was a terrible purchase the instructions are not helpful the icons on the instructions do not even match those on the actual camera it did not save any photos or videos onto my sd card that i took on my trip and the sd card wouldnt sink up to my computer do not buy this productdoes not save pictures
11074,4,small size is good for one or two people very easy to useworks well
9339,4,makes rice preparation a snap use this to prepare some sushi rice and it came out perfect of course i had to do the other steps to make the sushi rice but cooking it was a breeze easy to clean up when finishedeasy to use
13414,5,i love this rice cooker it doesnt make my rice rock hard even if it sits in the rice cooker over night its easy to put away i like the fact that the plug is detachable the lid is easy to clean unlike the aroma rice cooker its everything i need it to doloving it
8034,1,i ordered the printer with the case and did not get the case id have to return and reorder to get it disappointed i havent tried it yet as it was a giftmissing case
1130,1,i bought this hoping the zoom and the fact that its a camera would take better pictures than my old phone camera took a bunch of pictures at my sons soccer game its terrible even the still photos were garbagemy phone takes better pictures
1733,1,i was very surprised at the poor quality of this camera at best it felt like a promotional digital camera one would have received as a promotion for a months subscription to sports illustrated its light the controls are rather antiquated compared to the ease and quality one has with a smart phone it powered up fine and once you get used to the old controls its clunky but manageable this is not recommendable for anything more than a childs toy camera will be returning and quite disappointed because it was purchased for a family vacation and was useless to us for the entire tripcheap quality do not recommend
9126,1,i was looking forward to using this one but sadly  out of  pictures that comes in the pacage are defected  of them totally not usable very disappointed for the price it costs id expect a much better quality may be its just that package would like to get a replacementvery disappointed
5220,1,this worked for a week before we even left on a trip but wouldnt charge after that and stopped working completely we couldnt even take it on our trip for our child disappointingthis stopped working after a week with little use
4455,1,frameworks but i can hardly ever get the remote control to work im so pissed off at this remote control i could stop on it and break it into  million pieces the remote control worked just wouldve got a five star but unfortunately i cant give it that with the remote control that doesnt workgood digital photo frame poor remote control
5776,1,this is the second canon camera i have purchased in the last five years and neither has functioned properlyfirst the battery is internal removable but it cannot be charged via cable no it must be removed to be charged if the internal battery which hasnt lasted an hour dies i cant just plug it in so the precise settings i have for microdetail are rendered moot as the battery hatch is located next to the tripod mountsecond none of the wireless functions work i cannot connect to my computer tablet phone or cloud service i can sure connect to my home network but nothing else attempting to connect to a device leaves me in an endless loop of working record is  hours of working trying to connect to the cloud only gives a prompt to set the correct date and time despite the internal clock being within seconds of the network and that is not an easy task to conduct on this cameraso in order to get any picture off the camera i have to do this manually the app only works apple  google as well so forget it if you happen to have a microsoft product all those precise settings have to be readjusted after each shoot making this product more hassle than its worthmy phone may not take nearly as good pictures but at least i can use themdo not buy canon
961,1,no space not clear lose my moneynot good
3374,1,ill be excited to take pictures because i can understand the cameracamera for seniors and kids
4854,1,really cute camera that my daughter used her own money to purchase the quality is worse than the original polaroid cameras really disappointed in the qualitycute looking camera that produces horrible pictures
8374,1,i thought it was the printer at first but it did not do the same thing with previous ink paper so i think this is a bad batch im not sure but its adding a red  pink color over all my photos you can even see theres streaks in the picture of the ink not dispersing evenly its ruining my photos
8044,2,its practical for polaroids but sadly mine came with sharpie marks on the cover thankfully it doesnt seem like a common issuebeware of sharpie marks
3738,1,i was super excited for this camera and i followed the instructions to get it set up the cameras red light for low battery kept going off and the camera never turned on waste of moneycouldnt get it to turn on and wouldnt charge
1081,2,i got this as an extra light camera to putter around with while im out and about that it records  video is a plusit takes a good picture and even the videos will look good with little to no tinkeringthe internal microphone is just ok at about a foot away the sound isnt the cleanest but you can always fix that up in postproduction with most tools imovie davinci resolve etcthe jack for the external microphone doesnt work ive tried a few microphones that ive had in other cameras and all i get is a buzzing sounds ive tried several different wiring configurations thinking that it might have just been something that wasnt documented somewhere but that wasnt it since there are so many similar issues and i dont see where the company actually advertises the external mic jack  outside of the documentation that comes with the camera im assuming that this was either found after productionfor kids and first time vloggers who want to use a camera instead of their mobile phone this is fine they might even learn a thing or two about photographythe accessories  batteries shoulder strap and uv filter are nice additionsthe view screen flips out to face the front which is a nice touch as wellan acceptable beginners point and shoot for kids with a wonky external microphone jack
859,1,product was not as advertised first the camera was not in its package was in the carrying and appears to have been opened and used did not come with the accessories that were listed in the description was listed it would come with  packages of film it came with  packages and one of them was empty overall was a complete let down for the young lady it was gifted to for her birthday would give  stars but was not an optionsent me a used camera w no accessories
1832,2,easy and fun to use but the quality just isnt there if youre only looking to use this a few times then this is the camera for you if you want this to take pictures for longer than a few months look elsewhereworks decent for about  months
9048,2,i absolutely love these polaroid films however the delivery was not as smooth as it always is the box was literally dented into as shown in the photo i hope none of the films are destroyedunsatisfied with delivery
9129,1,bought this film and multiple packs were damaged waste of money when you can only use  out of the  photos i would like a refund or replacementdamaged upon arrival
306,1,wasnt what i expectedpicture quality sucks
7054,1,what a nice product to have not worked after the  day of use we purchased this camera for our kids to document our family vacation from their perspective they had a great time using it on our drive down to the gulf shores and at the zoo but it did not turn on after that and we had  days of vacation leftthe flash would open up but the touch screen was blank and when we plugged it in to be charge even the charging screen would not appearits a sturdy camera the touch screen was a little soft to touch as i thought it would be glass and the picture quality on the prints werent the best but was fun while it lastedi would not recommend this at all and now it seems like im out  since i forgot to purchase the protection planif anyone decides to buy this camera buy the protection plandid not work after the  day
9487,5,we love this rice cooker it makes a bunch of rice in  minutes we use it almost nightlygreat for meal prep and family dinner

2456,1,i do not suggest this camera at all bad pictures blurry and dark i purchased two returned only one because my teenage daughter wanted something for vacation but i do not recommendterrible
4684,1,first use lost all data on memory card didnt trust anymorelost data on first memory card inserted
978,1,the camera quality is trash  its not easy to use at all  i want my money backthe camera sucks  i hate it 
4100,1,unfortunately one star is as low as it goes i bought one system had it installed and immediately had problems getting one of the cameras to sync after going though a lot of indian customer service techs who allegedly spoke some type of english it was determine we had a bad camera so i had to replaced though amazon great right i went ahead and got an arlo pro camera at best buy so we could use the audio function instead of a ring video door bell since i have two cameras that overlap on the front of my house i was stunned at the difference in resolution at night with the pro you could clearly see for  of yards in all directions with a true night vision look the regular arlo gave you about  feet at night maximumwhen i got the new unit i put the additional arlo camera in the back of the house and it also seemed to have much better night resolution than the other arlo camerathen after a week it went out and once again after dealing with another rep from calcutta i was told my only options were to replace the camera with another one or replace the whole system since now  if the first  arlo camera have completely failed and one has terrible night resolution i am done with the arlo standard model since the  just came out i bet you will soon find these discontinued they are significantly inferior products and with rapid rate of technology they are probably already junkdo not buy the basic arlo model i suspect these being sold maybe old models that sat around in warehouse for years or fell off a truck or ship somewhere may god have mercy upon your soul if you have any problems and have to use their customer service it would be better to just replace it with hal or something i would probably go with nest system if i had to do it all overthe battery life is typically a few weeks the daytime performance of all cameras and sensitivity is good to very good the installation is very easy when they workin sum get a pro or dont go these are not very good and i would highly recommend staying away from them and they are obviously a beta model  this is one of my very few negative reviews btw so take it for what it is worthobsolete low level system with inconsistent cameras quality poor reliability with calcutta customer service
3202,1,was sent to me as replacement for a noncompatabale flash that came with a camera bundle this flash doesnt work eitherdoesnt work as stated
1065,1,the camera worked for like three weeks before it just stopped reading sd cards not worth the money spent on itdidnt make it a month
8946,2,worked great but broke getting replacement fingers crossedsending replacement
3818,2,impossible to use the software is unusable viewing a picture after taking it takes an unnecessary amount of steps and switching between picture and video is frustratingterrible user interface
5216,1,the camera will not play sound on playback now if it is suppose to no idea grandson is not impressed he says it is not what he wanted and will go back to using one of the old phonesno sound on playback
281,1,this camera its good but it was very difficult to get the image the way i wanted sometimes it was too dark or sometimes it had too much bright so i decided to returned and exchanged for a canon rebel  but when i see my reimburse i was in chock they gave me store credit so i stock with a gift card instead of receive my cash back to my amazon credit card i am so disappoint i have to be more careful when i buy in amazon i am not happy at allit wasntt what i expected
14770,5, have been looking for a rice cooker that makes congee gave this one a try turned out good easy to use quiet machine no mess lets just hope this cooker lastsmakes congee
11226,1,sadly i have not gotten to experience using this as it arrived with something loose rolling around making noise in the bottom part of it and the lid button not in place broken so it wont shut close and button looks ugly box also arrived broken so sad because i waited a long time to finally go ahead and purchase and am not happy with what i received at allarrived broken
8281,1,this broke after  month my daughter got this for christmas and was so excited it worked great at first now about a month later it will not hold a charge weve tried changing out the charger and everything its been disappointingdidnt last
1657,2,might be a good starter for a child but my cell phone camera takes sharper cleaner picturesunhappy
4519,2,you are paying for the software more than the camera yes it is an action camera yes it is waterproof however it is not rugged you would think from the heavy weight and feel it would have some higher quality glass for the lens ive had mine for just over a month and i am going to have to do an insurance trade in because the lens is so scratched it makes the video quality unacceptableas for the camera being waterproof yes it is waterproof however dont try and do  videos underwater the quality is absolutely horrible you might as well be using a digital camera from  even when i turn  off the quality is lacking at  comparatively to my gopro hero  at  even during good lighting the actual video quality isnt that great perfect for a phone screen but dont try and blow it up to a tv screenhonestly i wish i would have never purchased this camerathe software on the other hand the editing is top notch its prebuilt algorithms are fun and intuitive i hope if i ever get a decent  action camera i can use their software but i doubt ittoo good to be true but too late to return it
8886,2,this camera has a lot of nice features and would be really great if the manufacturer fixed just one problem the pictures come out blurry it is not apparent when viewing them on a computer full screen without zooming in however zoom in a little bit and they are blurry regardless of what camera setting lighting condition or type of scene im shooting i wasnt expecting high end quality but the picture quality is no better than inexpensive cell phone pics an early red flag in regards to quality control the instructions arent written grammatically correct though you can kind of figure out what they meanpictures come out blurry low end cell phone quality
1806,1,i bought this a few months ago and had to return it once due to not working properly and the second one no longer works as well waste of money just buy a good one and better quality onedoesnt last
8792,1,ive followed the instructions to the letter with this thing ive even tried not following the instructions to see if it helps ive let other people read the instructions and try it and see if maybe im just overlooking something but still every single photo comes out either extremely low contrast or too dark to see anything ive taken them in broad daylight with flash you name it every single one comes out so bad its not worth keeping it could be the film so im going to leave this review on both utter waste of money do not buypictures come out terrible
8989,1,lighting adjuster was broken on the original and the replacement camerasi ordered this for my classroom and after returning the first one because all the pictures turned out dark the replacement came in and it had the same issues when turning the dial for lighting setting the light indicator would not change over i was so busy with work that i forgot to complete the return on the second camera what a hasslebroken twice
2347,1,horrible quality camera it came with the wrong size of the paper to print i will return it now first it had to get a bad review so people dont waist their time and moneyhorrible camera
4668,1,i loved it when received it a few months later and with very little use i will have to return this because it overheats and constantly ejects itself in the middle of transferring files my micro sd card gets too hot i hope it doesnt get damaged it so slow at transfering filesa waste of money and timeloved it at first but now it will be returned
5282,2,sorry i just didnt like the feel of the camera and returned it it was hard to see the images on the  screen in any kind of sunlighttelephoto a real hassle
8808,1,this product has awful photo quality do not recommendterrible photo quality
8323,1,battery didnt stay charged my child took six pictures and it went deadbattery
3972,1,this camare did not work had to send it to be repaired had to pay for the shipping they send me another one and it didnt work neither im just done with this camara now i have to send it again and pay for shipping never buying one againdoes not work
7207,1,the product was great at first but then the buckle snapped right off of the product i message them and they told me that its not their responsibility i told them i only had it for a week they said oh well buy another one i recommend you dont buy this product evergreat idea horrible quality
6490,2,not as bright as i thought it would be and after a little bit the light starts blinking which is very annoying this happens every time its turned onnot all its cracked up to be
14247,5,i have been using a black and decker for about  years now i have a real rice cooker that cooks rice perfectly every time easy to use easy to clean im very happy with itbest ever
2293,1,play video got this camera because the reviews were good on it but it sucks ass worked perfectly fine for a couple days then it started saying battery exhausted right when i turned it on and then it would turn right back off now it doesnt even turn on with batteries in it so if you wanna waste youre time and money get this camera waste of money
7893,2,this product is very easy to use however after the first few prints the photo quality went down hill the color is very different when printed very disappointedprint quality is a disappointment
7788,1,camera looks new still has plastic on the screen the camera will not detect the sd card i tried many different ones and none registerwill not read the sd card  arrived broken
4802,2,i got a used camera and so far only the first pack that came with it had worked all of the other pictures come out with a weird quality hoping its the picture packs themselves that are damaged and not the camera if the new pack i bought still has the weird quality i will have to buy a new camera used camera
4421,1,neat concept but i bought one worked great for a few months until it got knocked over on its face not far just flipped forward on counter and the screen cracked so i ordered another one and not two weeks later same issue happened they wont get me on a third do not buy unless you are putting it somewhere securedvery fragile
14760,4,getting it out of the cabinet and setting it up takes time so using it isnt really quicker than boiling the rice in a pot of watervery convenient but im not sure by the time i set it up its a timesaver
3816,2,also trouble with white balance even with multiple film photo white illuminationdate must be yearmonthdaytime must be  hourswont focus within  must be farther away
4662,2,the photo is misleading it does not come with a memory card or the memory card insertdoes not come with memory card
7683,2,it worked good for a week and after that i see battery dyeing with in  minutes dont waste money for this onevery poor quality and battery dies in  minutes
2435,1,very disappointed the auto focus  as well as the so called manual focus features both suck trying to take a video with good lighting and setting the focus point in the center of the frame sometimes works but about  of the time the camera struggles for minutes to get focused the worst part of it is that there is no indication to the photographer that the camera is not focused it looks fine on the cameras screen its only after the video has been uploaded to the desktop or laptop that its evident that the focus is way off blurry as hell  making the video totally useless the subject is simple  just selfie centered in the frame with no confusing background or low lighting minimal movement of the subject which is at about  inches from the camera lens the camera is mounted on a stable tripod not a selfie stick and is indoors i also have had the same focus problems when using the selftimer to make still shots i wind up with a string of useless badly out of focus pictures also in video mode the battery life is unbelievably short lots of swell features but since it does not reliably focus none of them have any practical value i do not recommend this cameranot recommended

5617,2,What I don't like about this camera is that when you zoom in it shakes a lot and it is recorded in the video and another thing that I didn't like is that the date is recorded in the videos and obviously it doesn't look good to publish the videos on YouTube it doesn't have too much sharpness in the videos does not focus well

6356,1,"Addendum from April the camera gets hot when used for a long time the little one was allowed to play with it for a few minutes snake tetris sudokan when I took the camera in my hand I was very frightened where the card slot is the camera gets dangerously hot I was able to find the spot for more than a few seconds don't touch it doesn't work at all I've seen something similar with other models from other manufacturers stay away from this type of camera original review A lot has already been written here about this toy I would like to briefly summarize the most important points for me the camera quickly ends up as a play device There are a few games on it, albeit in quite poor quality, Sudokan Tetris. She likes to use the camera as a replacement for a Gameboy when the grown-ups aren't paying attention. It's very easy to use and takes photos and videos after minimal instruction. The videos have such a pitiful sound that it's hard to bear The possibility of printing photos on thermal paper rolls is a very good party gag. The child loves it and with adjustment options for the output quality you get pretty usable prints. But mind you, these are black and white lofi pictures that have more in common with a receipt than with a photo print, but you can tell There's a surprising amount on it and you can't deny a certain artistic character. I think the option is a success. In the end, the quality of the digital photos is completely inadequate, but the device is enough to get your first experience with media recordings"
15234,5,works goodi like it
4512,1,"After synchronizing it with the phone, it does not turn off with the button, it only turns off by resetting it, it does not charge and it stays stuck on the home screen.

6343,1,hello we bought this camera in June to take advantage of an interesting coupon unfortunately we gave it to our son in September and the camera is already broken it is October in addition to that the camera feels like it is burning I think that components inside are burnt out is it possible to receive a new product because I suppose that we have a guarantee on this type of product I would like to point out that the box had already been opened when we received it I hope not to have received a product which had just been returned by a customer Please come back to me to resolve this issue.

3284,1,"This disappointed me a lot. I was looking for a camera with which I could record blogs with my family and my partner. I had other cameras in mind but I read some comments and they said that the quality was good, totally false, starting with the manual, it did not give clear instructions when I tried to enter The card did not fit completely, I tried it many times and it did not fit, the quality is horrible, very, very horrible, I was not expecting a camera with a quality and for the price, you cannot expect something from the other world, but this camera is not worth dollars, it does not focus at all everything looks blurry and faded and when you try to take a picture in the sunlight everything goes white and dull i have the phone pro max and i'd rather keep my cell phone than that stupid camera this camera would be perfect for 12 year olds it's not worth it"
8105,2,I had a lot of expectations about this machine but the photos are always dark. I ask for assistance because I don't know if the machine is faulty. Thanks
708,2,For the price it is not bad but the quality of the photographs it takes is lowpoor quality of the photographs
16904,5,goodcomprar
11645,5,I didn't expect it to come out so good it was used and if I remember correctly it was repaired I didn't pay attention when I ordered it I was distracted and I saw it at a good price when I realized I was going to cancel and my husband told me not to do it he was going to It comes out good and I really have no complaints about it. I can even make panetelas which my old one didn't do and it's even better thanks to Amazon because it said that it was repaired by you and there is no scam in what you mentioned. I didn't expect it.

529,1,it's not a good camera quality is not a good camera quality
4786,1,never turned on
4558,1,I am an interior photographer I bought this camera for the creation of real estate virtual tours the quality of the images is to say the least indecent indoors digital noise which destroys the pixels makes the photos unsellable in full sun outdoors no problem euros thrown away in my case
8118,1,camera didn't work
4502,1,"There are really many reasons why I do not recommend buying this product, but the main ones, the main attraction of a retro camera, is to be able to print the images and this product does not even come with a courtesy cartridge and the prices are very high, making it not worth it. The quality of the photographs leaves a lot that the connection with the cell phone is limited to selecting which photographs you want to print with the camera, they cannot be saved directly in it. The materials are very plastic, there is nothing metal, so at the slightest hit it can be very unless you get a polaroid type photo printer conclusion it is just a hook to sell and continue selling photo cartridges that are not cheap at all I regret buying it"
11143,5,"I love this thing, it cooks the rice quite quickly and it does it very well and as if that were not enough, with the accessory it comes with you can cook some vegetables or other foods with the same steam while the rice is cooking, so you save time, effort and even something. excellent electrical energy"

8870,1,zoom does not workdoes not work
9910,4,I like how it works but there is nothing in the manual about how to use it. It took me a lot to learn how to use it. I like how it works but it is a little difficult to use and it does not come with instructions for use.
3385,1,ordered it in april quit working in junedissatisfied
4655,1,bad bad quickly it disconnects from my phone
8123,1,"The photos do not come out well from a cartridge, only two photos came out well, I do not recommend it."
4859,1,play video the photos come out blank I mean the movie is worthless if you take the photos but from there the images don't come out and I'm already wasting photos I'm disappointeddisappointed by this purchase
5426,1,the quality of the images is terrible
11098,4,gets the job donedecent
7088,1,"It's a Kodak children's camera, it just leaves a lot to be desired, pure marketing, it's a total waste of money, a shame."
1385,1,Just having the camera on without recording gets incredibly hot. I'm going to return it because I don't even want to imagine if it's recording many minutes.
6283,2,this product is really effective in its function and the lightroom plugin software works very well the problem comes from the really questionable construction quality which does not give at all confidence in the duration of thin plastic and which gives an impression of fragility plastic hinges which are hard to open and give the impression that it could break at any moment I find it very hard to believe that it will still be whole within a few months at this price close to in and for a product which is supposed to be used regularly this is not acceptable to me
5545,1,"I returned it for the simple reason that the zoom is not efficient, blurry image, I was looking for a versatile camera for a stay, I didn't want to take my camera with the different lenses but this one didn't meet my wishes"
4557,1,"terrible, the first one crashed after the firmware update and has now been replaced. The second one stopped working after once in the water. It only turns on if connected to the power cord and doesn't charge the batteries. Plus, we don't know how to send it for repairs via Amazon, which prevents purchases. easy but the problems to solve after the sale are difficult"
16398,5,"This small rice cooker is very practical for if you are a person who lives alone like me, it cooks super well since it is small, it fits anywhere in your kitchen. I recommend it so you won't have to waste your food. Spectacular."
7942,2,"This camera looks very nice, fits well in the hand and takes good quality pictures for a Polaroid, which can also be saved so that I can print them out later. But that's about it with the positive features. I bought this camera so that I can have beautiful souvenir pictures of my daughter Unfortunately, I was able to print images exactly. After that, the camera only printed black images. I tried all the settings. It didn't get any better and I ended up throwing entire films in the bin. There's no help in the operating instructions to fix the error, so I looked on the internet After these problems there, I read that these cameras often have such problems and that you can only send them back. It's actually a shame because I really like these pictures"
8117,1,I bought it for my birthday and it was faulty from the start when I didn't turn it on for a few days it forgot to have the cartridges inside and I had to reinsert it since it marked available photos and therefore a cartridge was started which the Polaroid mistakes for the protective film when you start a new package when the photos are developed they have small defects at the corners or even leave a small black bar as if the camera had not managed to frame the photo well in the cartridge frame an experience not to be repeated with polaroid
2932,2,"Unfortunately, the cards don't stick to the board very well"
16830,5,exelenteespectacular

576,1,"after minutes of use the display stopped working, I put in new batteries but it still didn't work, customer service never responded"
1386,1,Attention: unusable product because without wifi and without a latest generation smartphone the product does not update so it doesn't even take a photo. At least for the money spent the app should work with everything the updated cam and that it can be used independently without having to download anything the app tests and updates have been made with Xiaomi and Samsung I am truly sorry and disappointed I cannot find an adequate solution without spending more money I will return the product in the meantime I have wasted whole days to understand these points mentioned above because the manufacturing company does not immediately specify these they should worry about specifying the compatible ones or at least the characteristics of the smartphone to be used
11129,5,great productgreat product
14905,5,excellent product I recommend it very good
9309,4,"very good practice and light, easy rice, delicious and fast"
4501,2,"I get an intense marked stripe in all the photos with the first tests. I hope it is the reason for the film and not the camera. I will wait and change the review but because of some bad ones, change it and hope for better luck."
5474,2,"I bought the camera with the hope of being able to use it both to take photos and to use it as a webcam with the obs or zoom program but it does not work for these functions, the live signal cannot be output either via HDMI, USB or WiFi, review tutorials and manuals and confirm it if you need a camera for photos and videos without needing to see live the signal is perfect nor did you want to use it as a webcam or capture the signal via HDMI it will not work for you what I did not like is that it did not clarify these aspects anywhere in The description of the camera can be used as a webcam or view the live signal via HDMI"
12351,5,It has a good size and works very well. It arrived quickly. We are simplifying the kitchen with the help of the very good rice cooker. I loved it.

2934,2,"We received the game yesterday and wanted to try it out right away. Unfortunately, the face of this rotating monster is shown twice and the body is completely missing, which is really annoying because you can't search for all the monsters"
4537,2,"I bought to replace my old camera from the competing American brand the max I am very disappointed by it I understand better why it is always tested outdoors in direct sunlight or with a lot of snow high brightness on the videos I go mountain biking it's a camera impossible to use on a bike because of the format of the device and the quality of the intrinsic image no nothing is worth first of all the vivid color mode is totally unusable as the colors come out in fluorescent first setting to switch to standard mode the colors are correct and allow you to output videos without too much hassle otherwise there is the log mode to work the color grading with precision during editing I decided to use a temperature at I like a bit warm since I ride outside the exposure after a few videos I realized that the sharpness had a serious problem on this camera, actually set it to the maximum and it gives an image full of noise pricked everywhere, so you have to put the sharpness as low as possible and unfortunately there is always noise the grain of the compression of the pixels even in broad daylight in full sun open ground the image is really not beautiful it gives the feeling of a surveillance camera image so I said to myself that I had to compare with my old camera it is quite simply the day and the night between the two the latter was shooting with similar settings with the sharpness at minimum and in no case do I end up with a destroyed image as with the I have no grain no noise no compression the image of the max is surely a little more blur overall compared to the but it remains smooth its rendering is clean and the videos are usable the image of the is from another time in my opinion concerning the mountain bike it is clear that the choppy light conditions in the forest do not please it at all more it is difficult to find an optimal position for the pov position with a torso montage if we put his head up I find the angle of view too high it breaks the impression of speed if we put his head down it's good except that the legs often hit it when pedaling and sometimes it hits the handlebars on big climbs it is annoying if you place it on the helmet we are really afraid of it being torn off by a branch the same in the bag with the pole it is not enough compact for this use concerning the positive aspects yes the screen is nice fluid comfortable large etc nothing to say above but as a result the camera does not have an appropriate format for my use the accessories are of good quality even if they are expensive it must be recognized that the pole is light and fits everywhere I also like all the little options which allow you to suppress the sound the lights turn off the screen change lenses etc. the ergonomics are rather well thought out I haven't had any bugs on the other hand I noticed that the camera heats up a lot finally you actually have to activate the camera via the app on smartphone we feel that the manufacturer remains the owner of its equipment and that it likes to impose its confidentiality policy concerning the concern of horrible noise on the image even in minimum sharpness I contacted the after-sales service which was initially overwhelmed finally I received an email minutes after my request on their chat which told me that I should not use this camera at night but I had told them that I only used it during the day their automatic translator must not be up to par I relaunched the request by giving them my settings and two files they no longer responded in short the after-sales service is absent for subscribers"
8010,1,The camera has an absolutely terrible battery life. After just printing out pictures it gives up the ghost and has to be reloaded. Bad purchase
4562,1,it overheats and stops continuously then the usual bad luck with the electronics no longer occurred
7960,1,for me this product is not worth its price certainly it allows me to print photos from your mobile phone it's also cool to have a screen to see the photo before taking it and above all to be able to choose the photos you want to print or not whether the device has numerous flash features possibility of inserting an SD card possibility of taking a selfie and seeing yourself in a mirror microphone recording of voice messages for each photo which you can listen to by scanning the QR code however the quality of the photos taken on the instax mini liplay is not up to par appointment and it's a shame in fact the device does not allow you to zoom when you take photos and very often the images in the lenses are blurry and lack precision you then obtain a photo of poor quality this device remains good if you simply want to have fun and print photos photos taken with your phone personally I expected more regarding the quality of the photos
9592,5,i love it so beneficialcollege essential
2926,2,"The tentacles grip very well, but that's all the good things about the game. The lathe is quite small, so it's difficult for the very little ones to recognize the monster they're looking for right away. At the beginning it's quite entertaining, but the same ones often appear on the lathe Monsters so the game gets boring very quickly. Not a purchase recommendation"

7945,1,"Everything worked well, the goods arrived on time for inspection, I unpacked the camera, looked at the programs, packed it up again and sent it back.

I don't know if I should buy another one because I can't afford it again, so I hope I get an answer or help."
7956,2,"I can't say if the model I bought for my niece came out defective, but the printed photos come out significantly darker than the ones seen on the display before printing and I'm talking about photos taken outside on the balcony during the day, paying attention to the backlight. question mark from my niece who was trying to justify everything so as not to make me angry. It wasn't nice to see the prints instead of photos sent from the Bluetooth phone, they look great but at that point I might as well buy a HP or Canon Selphy printer that prints in format credit card that"

8583,1,The quality of the camera in terms of its components is very bad and of low quality. The resolution is very bad. It is not even close to an Amazon. You should verify the quality of the products it advertises since this is misleading advertising. Do not buy.

However, the quality of the pictures is not good at all. At the beginning I had a Polaroid instant camera and it has already delivered better pictures almost years later Such unsuccessful shots, dark stripes despite lots of light and flash. This camera is not worth the money in this modern age, offering such rubbish"

3396,2,"I don't know exactly what I expected but something else. The camera arrived well packaged and I tested it with my niece right away. Everything is very easy to use for both children and adults. The colored pencils were of very poor quality and are We constantly broke them, we threw them away and now use our own. What disappointed me the most was the quality of the pictures. It's absolutely clear to me that it's a children's camera and not a Polaroid camera, but everything was always so pixelated and you often couldn't recognize what was happening My niece was very disappointed and she doesn't really use the camera anymore. Unfortunately, I don't have any recommendations"
8131,2,"The camera itself brought back memories of my childhood for me. My grandparents had a Polaroid back then and that was at least the last thing we had as kids Back then, the camera comes without a film but with filters x color and x star effect. It is charged with a USB cable. It has a flash and the ability to control various settings via an app, including a completely manual setting of aperture and exposure time. You also have the option of setting the aperture and exposure time in the app I find the menu item Aperture to be particularly funny and not particularly meaningful here: the motif is too light or too dark wow, that helps now. You can see whether it is light or dark at the moment, but why such a statement doesn't matter as I had seen that it was also bw There are film cassettes out there, I was really impressed and ordered a BW cassette, reduced in euros, produced here at Amazon. I look through the camera with my left eye. My nose is always on the casing. I can only imagine the section of the image because I can't quite look at it with my eye I come to the light shaft and so I always tried to put my right eye in between. It doesn't work any better. I need to get used to it. First of all, I took a photo without an app with a flash Unfortunately, you can only see that it should be away from the subject when you have scrolled through the app and again such a strange result. The image quality is a lot worse than what you feared because of the flash and it looks as if the photo was taken years ago. To be clear, the pictures were taken All turned over and stored warm for development but somehow they all looked broken. It was enough for me. The camera costs euros. A film cassette with photos costs another euro or a little cheaper if you take a pack or something. That means about euros per picture. Mind you, it's not reproducible. None negative no files it is and remains a one-time snapshot you can like it or not what's the point for me but a camera where I only produce rejects the errors in the photos pointed more to a technical cause than to incorrect operation whether it was the film or the camera I don't really care, I think it's stars for the retro factor. If you want halfway usable shots, you should probably buy a used KBSLR with bad optics on it then it will still look better, or use a Diana that takes much better pictures for less money on medium format film and completely analogue without any technology If you like trashy recordings, you can access them without hesitation. Unfortunately, it wasn't expensive"

17331,5,I think it took me more than two months to decide to buy it. The extremely high price kept me undecided and I was about to give up because of the good reviews. My husband suggested that I buy it and about a month ago I bought it. I had seen a video of it on YouTube. someone comparing it with another one with a lower price and I laughed when they said that they even charged for the little music and well the pot I love the different model that is from Japan but that person is right I only cook white and mixed rice but honestly it looks the same as in my old aroma with the big difference that until today it has not stuck to the bottom and I can take advantage of everything and in the aroma there was almost an inch of burnt rice. The aroma was very good except that this old one is not going to belittle it if they gave me choose now that I know it I think I would buy it again excellent article

4508,1,"If you are going to use it only to print the photos, ok, although I think there are better quality-price alternatives, even within Fuji itself. If you want to use a photo that you have taken as a file on the PC, it is useless. The quality seems like that of a cell phone from years ago. In short, If you want it like any other cheaper Fuji snapshot and it does the same if you want to use the useless digital file due to its poor quality."
1191,1,"I bought it as a gift for Annida's granddaughter, an old photographer who started with her grandfather's bellows Kodak and ended up with a super film Nikon before moving on to digital compacts, little better than cell phone photos. I find the zoom exciting, even if it's excessive, and the digital stabilizer allows you to take photos. nice little films with strong optical zoom I had my granddaughter take a photo from the plane of a tree just under a hundred meters away with wind and you could see many leaves still and in focus but that way you don't learn to take photographs, everything is done by the camera"
2929,1,It's just shameless to send the game like that and it can't be given away like that

6347,2,the memory card supplied with the camera never works internal memory of the camera is therefore very quickly saturated plus the screen fell from its location after just days of damage
8017,1,My daughter loved it and it was very easy to use.
420,1,the quality of the photos is not there
4500,1,"I would like to start by saying that I use various Fujifilm instant and digital cameras with satisfaction and not only that the product in question was created to be a hybrid which should include a point and shoot digital camera and an instax mini format printer for prints the size of a credit card the only thing the design is very beautiful but it is not very functional both as a camera and as a printer as a camera the quality of the files is very very low any mobile phone takes superior photos also between pressing the shutter button and the shutter itself sometimes more than a second passes so the photos can be blurred as the printer must be used with care because what is shown on the rear screen is not always rendered in the same way in the instant print a shadow area can lose every detail and appear completely black while an illuminated area can be completely white and so if it's burnt the battery doesn't last long the rear lever for printing photos gives the impression of being the first thing that will break the camera has an internal memory which allows you to take about images it can also accommodate a micro SD card but it doesn't allow you to move photos between the memory internal and the card and vice versa absurd, in essence this time fujifilm has created a failing product that is not satisfactory either as a digital camera or as a printer and in fact a toy for children for a product that I strongly advise against"
4979,2,"I was missing the boxes with photographic papers to print, they did not arrive complete"
6100,1,I ordered the product twice and neither time did the product work. Don't waste your time buying this product. It doesn't work.
8134,2,"This Polaroid Now Gen has a current price that is its RRP, being the lowest price it has had to date on Amazon. In my house, we are quite fond of photography, especially my father, and the truth is that having a Polaroid at home always brings good results. memories since it takes us back a little to our childhood in which our father used one, now he has a more professional one and many accessories to entertain himself since now he can give free rein to his passion when he is retired, this particular model is good having Keep in mind that it is not a professional camera like my father's and that it is more for taking instant photos of specific moments so the image quality is good but not spectacular. One aspect that I don't really like about this type of camera is that it Part of the fact that they tend to be cheap, the price of spare parts seems exorbitant to me, so in the end it is cheaper to take photos on another camera or with your cell phone and develop them. It seems like a major mistake to me that it does not have a small screen where you can view the image. photo and choose whether you want to take it or not, the function that the children's toy camera has, for example, which is thermally printed since the photo, even on top of it, comes out wrong or with the eyes closed or something like that, so you can tell me here if we could to say that mistakes are paid dearly hahaone of the things that I really liked is that it can be controlled with the cell phone through a Bluetooth connection polaroid adapting to the new times very entertaining this works summary very good memories with my father's polaroid from years ago but this one falls short since it follows the Polaroid line but has not adapted sufficiently to the new times, it lacks essential functions and the prices of the spare parts and therefore the photos are very very expensive and also not They can be viewed before they are revealed in case there are any errors, it still has a lot to improve"

I understand that It is new but for the price this should not happen"
4504,2,"Filters and lenses of which you can at best have a normal double exposure over the middle and use two pictures next to each other. Two next to each other also has an FW bug that makes the pictures hopelessly overexposed, otherwise the pictures from the camera are rather terrible, but still fun for pictures printed out on a smartphone per picture Looks better despite the lower resolution, but here too, percent monitoring beats it, at least on iOS, the apps from Fujifilm grab all the data they get, which is completely unnecessary and clearly steered clear"

I returned the camera"

The color comes out just as dead and with more and more scratches as if something rubbed when the photo came out.

2909,1,"We bought the game as a gift for children in kindergarten. Unfortunately the quality of the playing cards is so bad that the cards broke the first time they were played. The suction cups are quite strong and if you don't pull the cards extremely carefully from the suction cups, they break Of course, they aren't particularly careful. I asked the publisher to send me a replacement set of cards. After a few weeks, I received a letter that happened to have cards in it. I can still understand somewhere that they don't want to replace the entire set, but then I just ask At least once again to find out which cards are defective, I would strongly recommend laminating the cards and then holding the game for a while, but I think it's bad that such cards are even sold and how Schmidt treats his customers"
3547,2,"What they say about the images is great but it tends to deform the image in certain shots. The speed to transfer the videos is super slow, practically consuming the entire battery and the battery takes longer to charge than it lasts or even in use, a total disappointment and waste of money. What's the point of having a camera of this range where you have to invest in several batteries and also have the equipment heat up so much that it collapses? Disappointed"

I then tested it myself. It was neither because the recordings were shaky nor because Incorrect light or distance conditions, resolutions chosen too low in all resolutions from to, the pictures look the same. The picture attached here was also taken, so I thought the camera was defective, I sent it back and bought a new one, which arrived today after the first test It turned out that the pictures look exactly the same, making the camera unusable for me and a big disappointment for my daughter, who would have liked to take beautiful souvenir photos and films with it"

3397,2,"The image quality, if you can even speak of quality, is subpar. My camera is probably defective, but I can only rate what I have in my hands. For others it seems to work. The camera itself is very pretty compact and self-explanatory, even or especially for kids We still tried everything with the instructions to get decent prints out of it, unfortunately without success. If you transfer the pictures to the PC and print them out from there, the quality is okay, that's why I give it stars. With an RRP of EUR, the camera is not a cheap product and should work"

I still don't know if it works with the rolls. I hope so. But the net is garbage. How did it arrive?"
2905,2,"The packaging is a catastrophe, who would come up with something like that? I've now bought it on offer. If I had paid the full price, I would probably have been even more annoyed about it. The box is opened on the side instead of at the top as is usual with games, which means all the game pieces fly wildly messed up if the cardboard was at least stable but that's also not the case the cards are so thin and the suction cups are so strong that the cards get creases when you take them off so you should have just used thicker material we already had the game in the so I have a comparison but from The quality is simply top notch, even after years of use. With this game you can be happy if you survive several rounds. It's a shame"

Btw, I find it incredibly bold that Techleadde attaches any conditions to the return, for example Filling out a form that couldn't be found anywhere or having to communicate the return by email without even providing an email address which, by the way, couldn't be found despite an extensive search. I can't remember, for the life of me, having ever made such agreements with this seller I just bought from Amazon. I would like to report two positive things at this point, but Amazon didn't charge for express shipping. In any case, I can't find it in the invoice.
