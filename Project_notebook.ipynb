    "Post epoch 5, the continuous decrease in training loss accompanied by a stagnant validation loss is a typical sign of overfitting. This means that while the model is getting better and better at fitting the training data (hence the decreasing training loss), its performance on unseen data (validation set) is not improving, implying that the model might be memorizing the training data.\n",

Once the model is trained, it's ready to make predictions on new Amazon reviews and classify their sentiments."

    "### Training Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Total Epochs**: `14 out of 20`\n",
    "   - The model training was early-stopped at the 14th epoch, indicating that further training didn't improve the validation loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Size**: `64`\n",
    "   - Each batch contains 64 reviews that the model processes simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance Over Epochs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Epoch (Epoch 1)**:\n",
    "  - Training Loss: `0.6373`, Training Accuracy: `64.24%`\n",
    "  - Validation Loss: `0.4632`, Validation Accuracy: `82.73%`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best Epoch (Epoch 12)**:\n",
    "  - Training Loss: `0.1774`, Training Accuracy: `93.46%`\n",
    "  - Validation Loss: `0.2599`, Validation Accuracy: `90.17%`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Last Epoch (Epoch 14)**:\n",
    "  - Training Loss: `0.1602`, Training Accuracy: `94.21%`\n",
    "  - Validation Loss: `0.2697`, Validation Accuracy: `90.17%`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Progress**: The training accuracy improved significantly from the initial 64.24% in the first epoch to 94.21% in the 14th epoch. The model has learned well from the training data, as evident from the accuracy improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overfitting and Early Stopping**: The early stopping was triggered at epoch 14, restoring the weights from epoch 12, which had the best validation loss. This ensures that the model doesn't overfit to the training data and can generalize well on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation Results**: The validation accuracy was consistently higher after the initial epochs, reaching its peak at `90.17%` in epoch 12. This shows that our model is effective in sentiment prediction for unseen Amazon reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuning process of the BERT model has been successful. With an impressive accuracy on the validation set, we can conclude that the model is likely to perform well in real-world scenarios when given new Amazon reviews for sentiment prediction."
